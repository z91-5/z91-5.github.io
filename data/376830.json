Specific representatives of the class of emollient laxatives include mineral oil, dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate (docusate calcium), dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (docusate sodium), and dioctyl potassium sulfosuccinate (docusate potassium). PHARMACOLOGY: Both types of emollient laxatives produce an effect by softening and hydrating the feces without either direct or indirect reflex stimulation of peristalsis.  They produce a cathartic effect within 12 to 48 hours. TOXICOLOGY: Pulmonary aspiration of these products is unusual, but lipoid pneumonitis can develop if it occurs. Mineral oil suppresses the normal cough reflex.  Inhibition of both respiratory epithelial ciliary movement and outward flow of mucus allows oil to reach the alveoli, where a small fraction enters the hilar and abdominal lymph nodes or the liver and spleen via the peribronchial lymphatics.  Pulmonary lipases cannot hydrolyze mineral oil; it is taken up by macrophages, which disintegrate in time to release the oil. A cycle of uptake and release begins, leading to diffuse interstitial fibrosis, granulomatous reaction, or both occurs. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but severe toxicity is rare. OVERDOSE: Toxicity following acute ingestion of excessive amounts of these laxatives is generally minimal and limited to the gastrointestinal tract. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, foreign body reaction, intestinal obstruction, melanosis coli, cathartic colon, and fecal leakage may be noted. Onset of symptoms may be delayed for 1 to 3 days. Aspiration of mineral oil may result in lipoid pneumonia, which may cause permanent lung injury. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and bitter taste have occurred following the use of docusate. Anal seepage of large doses of mineral oil may cause pruritus ani, irritation, and perianal discomfort. <br\/>"},{"id":"376830-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LAXATIVES-EMOLLIENT<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Excessive diarrhea should be treated with oral or intravenous fluids and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status if severe. . MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In patients with aspiration lipoid pneumonia, orotracheal intubation may be necessary. Corticosteroids have been used in a few anecdotal reports of chronic pneumonitis; but efficacy is not established and they are not routinely recommended. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (a pulmonary bypass procedure used in cases of reversible acute pulmonary and cardiovascular failure) has been successful in the therapy of two cases of pediatric aspiration involving mineral oil or mineral seal oil found initially unresponsive to standard therapy for hydrocarbon aspiration.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Due to low toxicity and potential aspiration risk of these compounds, gastric decontamination is not recommended unless a serious coingestant or other clinical concern exists. HOSPITAL:  Due to low toxicity and potential aspiration risk of these compounds, gastric decontamination is not recommended unless a serious coingestant or other clinical concern exists.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe respiratory distress.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma levels of these agents are not available or clinically useful. Monitor fluid status and electrolyte concentrations in patients with significant diarrhea or vomiting. Aspiration lipoid pneumonia has been reported in patients using mineral oil. Monitor arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, and pulmonary function tests, and obtain a chest x-ray in any patient with respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with a minor unintentional exposure who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms can likely be managed at home.  OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Moderate to severely symptomatic patients and those with self harm ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for evaluation and treated until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"376830-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>LAXATIVES-EMOLLIENT<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: No specific toxic dose has been established.
