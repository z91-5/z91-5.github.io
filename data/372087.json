Carbimazole is a prodrug of methimazole.  PHARMACOLOGY: Methimazole is a thyroid hormone synthesis inhibitor. However, it does not inactivate the existing thyroxine and triiodothyronine stored in the thyroid or in the blood. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Hypothyroidism is unlikely to develop after a single acute overdose ingestion. Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, headache, fever, joint pain, pruritus, edema, or exfoliative dermatitis may occur following an overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, or agranulocytosis may occur several hours to days after an overdose. Hepatitis, nephrotic syndrome, neuropathies, and CNS stimulation or depression may occur infrequently. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Most adverse effects are dose-related and occur within the first 4 to 8 weeks of therapy. Chronic ingestion can result in a variety of immunologic-mediated adverse effects which are not expected to occur in overdose, including leukopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, hypoprothrombinemia, vasculitis, nephritis, lupus-like syndrome, and hepatitis.  Skin rashes are common following therapy and may occur secondary to hematologic toxicity during chronic therapy. Other reported adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, arthralgia, paresthesia, loss of taste, myalgia, headache, pruritus, drowsiness, neuritis, edema, jaundice, sialadenopathy, and lymphadenopathy. Fatal hepatic necrosis has been reported.  <br\/>"},{"id":"372087-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>METHIMAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Treatment with G-CSF or GM-CSF has been shown to significantly shorten recovery time in patients with methimazole-induced agranulocytosis. Administer colony stimulating factor for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim 5 mcg\/kg\/day subQ or IV over 15 to 30 minutes. Sargramostim 250 mcg\/meter(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serial CBC with differential with platelet count, renal function, liver enzymes, and thyroid function tests after significant overdose. Plasma concentrations are not routinely available. Measurement of T3 (triiodothyronine) and reverse T3 (a major metabolite of T4 with no metabolic activity) levels may confirm a history of ingestion, but the clinical significance is unknown.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, forced diuresis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been shown to be beneficial in methimazole overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with a small inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a large or deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"372087-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>METHIMAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
