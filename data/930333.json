use the second syringe to inject 8.4 mL of solvent into the dibotermin alfa vial, and then discard second syringe; swirl gently; do not shake.<\/li><li>Peel open matrix inner package (leave in tray) and use the syringe placed in sterile field to withdraw 8 mL of reconstituted dibotermin alfa solution; distribute uniformly on the matrix.<\/li><li>Final dibotermin alfa concentration is 1.5 mg\/mL (12 mg per vial); do not exceed this concentration.<\/li><li>Wait 15 minutes before using the prepared dibotermin alfa product; use within 2 hours.<\/li><li>Lumbar interbody fusion surgery: Use with approved (CE-marked) lumbar interbody fusion device; product is compatible with titanium, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and allograft bone.<\/li><li>Lumbar interbody fusion surgery: Do not overfill fusion device or anterior portion of intervertebral disc space.<\/li><li>Lumbar interbody fusion surgery: Cut wetted matrix into 6 equal pieces of approximately 2.5 cm x 5 cm; additional cuts may be made as required.<\/li><li>Lumbar interbody fusion surgery: Loosely fill hollow geometry of fusion device carefully and corresponding to the internal volume of the device.<\/li><li>Lumbar interbody fusion surgery: Do not implant matrix posterior to fusion device where access to spinal canal or nerve root may be possible; a physical barrier between matrix and neurological tissue is required if leakage into spinal canal or nerve root is possible.<\/li><li>Lumbar interbody fusion surgery: Do not irrigate inside of intervertebral disc space once matrix and fusion device are implanted; however, any fluid loss from wetted matrix outside of the intervertebral disc space should be rinsed away.<\/li><li>Lumbar interbody fusion surgery: Preferred placement of any required surgical drain is 1 layer superficial to implantation site; drain must be placed remotely from implantation site.<\/li><li>Acute tibia fracture surgery: Achieve definitive fracture reduction, fixation, and hemostasis prior to use of matrix.<\/li><li>Acute tibia fracture surgery: Fold or cut matrix as needed prior to implantation.<\/li><li>Acute tibia fracture surgery: Implant following completion of standard fracture and wound management (ie, at the time of soft tissue closure).<\/li><li>Acute tibia fracture surgery: Cover accessible surface area of fracture (ie, lines and defects) to the extent possible, placing the matrix to bridge the fracture region while making good contact with the major proximal and distal fragments.<\/li><li>Acute tibia fracture surgery: Matrix may be placed loosely packed (folded, rolled, or wrapped) into a void, as required by the geometry of the fracture, but do not use to fill void in presence of compressive forces as matrix does not provide mechanical stability.<\/li><li>Acute tibia fracture surgery: Do not irrigate wound after matrix is placed.<\/li><li>Acute tibia fracture surgery: Preferred placement of any required surgical drain is 1 layer superficial to implantation site;
