The reduction of ammonia concentrations and pH improves the potency of certain antibiotics and raises the cure rate.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"4218-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"4218-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Oral: time to peak concentration, 0.25 h to 1 h <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"4218-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Vd: extensive<\/li><li>Protein binding: none<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"4218-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Renal: 36% to 65% unchanged <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"4218-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>approximately 5 h to 10 h<\/li><li>Reduced renal function: prolonged<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"4218-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>take on an empty stomach <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"4218-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>symptomatic improvement<\/li><li>CBC and reticulocyte count; after 2 weeks of therapy and then at 3-month intervals for the duration of treatment<\/li><li>hepatic function<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"4218-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Lithostat<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 250 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"4218-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>This drug may cause loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, headache, anxiety, depression, or transient malaise.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of hemolytic anemia.<\/li><li>Patient should take this drug on an empty stomach.<\/li><li>Tell patient to avoid drinking alcohol while taking this drug, as a skin rash may occur.<\/li><li>Advise patient to call healthcare professional if a dose is missed, as drug should be given on a regular schedule.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
