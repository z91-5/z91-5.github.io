The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is not affected by the presence of DNA.<\/li><li>Systemic: Acetylcysteine may protect against acetaminophen overdose-induced hepatotoxicity by maintaining or restoring hepatic concentrations of glutathione. Glutathione is required to inactivate an intermediate metabolite of acetaminophen that is thought to be hepatotoxic. In acetaminophen overdose, excessive quantities of this metabolite are formed because the primary metabolic (glucuronide and sulfate conjugation) pathways become saturated. Acetylcysteine may act by reducing the metabolite to the parent compound and\/or by providing sulfhydryl for conjugation of the metabolite.<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"4590-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"4590-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Protein binding: 83% (intravenous)<\/li><li>Vd: 0.47 L\/kg<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"4590-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Hepatic: deacetylated by the liver to cysteine or oxidation to diacetylcystine and subsequently metabolized <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"4590-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 22% to 30%<\/li><li>Fecal: 3%<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"4590-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Adults: 5.6 hours<\/li><li>Newborns: 11 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"4590-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>Inhalation<\/b><br\/><ul><li>10% solution may be used undiluted<\/li><li>20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with sodium chloride inhalation solution, sodium chloride injection, or sterile water for injection or sterile water for inhalation<\/li><li>solution contains no antimicrobial agent; opened vials should be stored in the refrigerator and used within 96 hours<\/li><li>may be administered through nebulization into a face mask, mouth piece, tracheostomy, tent, or croupette, or through direct instillation intratracheally<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>color change of solution to slight pink or purple may occur; does not affect quality of product<\/li><li>preservative-free solution; discard unused portion<\/li><li>dilute in compatible solutions (D5W, 0.45%NaCl, sterile water for injection); diluted solution is stable for 24 hours at controlled room temperature<\/li><li>adjust total volume for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction; Acetadote(R) is hyperosmolar (2600 milliosmoles\/L [mOsm\/L]), and the osmolarity of the solution is increased as the diluent volume is decreased; adjust osmolarity to physiologically safe level, generally not less than 150 mOsm\/L in children<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>20% acetylcysteine solution should be diluted with diet cola or other diet soft drink to a final concentration of 5% (add 3 mL of diluent for each 1 mL of 20% acetylcysteine solution; do not decrease the proportion of diluent)<\/li><li>water may be used as the diluent if administered via gastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube<\/li><li>dilution should be freshly prepared and administered within 1 hour<\/li><li>undiluted solutions can be stored for 96 hours in the refrigerator<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"4590-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>acetaminophen overdose: plasma or serum acetaminophen level prior to detoxification, as early as possible but no sooner than 4 hours postingestion of immediate-release acetaminophen; if the time of ingestion is unknown or if the initial acetaminophen level was drawn less than 4 hours after ingestion, obtain a second acetaminophen level; if extended-release acetaminophen was ingested, then initial acetaminophen level must be drawn not less than 8 hours postingestion and a second level must be drawn 4 to 6 hours following the initial level; repeat levels as long as potentially toxic.<\/li><li>acetaminophen overdose: hepatic function (AST, ALT, bilirubin, prothrombin time), renal function (creatinine and BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes prior to detoxification  and daily during the detoxification process<\/li><li>acetaminophen overdose: acetaminophen levels, AST, ALT, and INR; before end of 21-hour infusion<\/li><li>mucolytic agent: decreased mucous viscosity, a productive cough, and improvement in respiration are indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>signs of bronchospasm in patients with asthma or with a history of bronchospasm; during therapy<\/li><li>(IV) serious anaphylactoid reaction; during administration, and especially during the first 30 to 60 minutes following initiation of the infusion as reaction usually occur during this time period<\/li><li>(IV) acute flushing and erythema; particularly during administration of loading dose<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"4590-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>  Capsule: 600 MG<\/li><li>Inhalation Solution: 10 %, 20 %<\/li><li>Intravenous Solution: 200 MG\/ML<\/li><li>Oral Capsule: 500 MG<\/li><li>Oral Solution: 20 %<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Acetadote<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 200 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>GNC NAC 600<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 600 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>NAC<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Capsule: 600 MG<\/li><li>Oral Powder: 1700 MG<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Novaplus Acetylcysteine<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 200 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"4590-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"4590-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>N-ACETYLCYSTEINE <\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Overdose with intravenous NAC most commonly causes an anaphylactoid response. Status epilepticus, cerebral edema, anoxic encephalopathy and death have been reported after massive intravenous overdose. ADVERSE EVENTS: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is used therapeutically primarily as a mucolytic or as an antidote to acetaminophen overdose.  COMMON: The primary toxicity of NAC consists of nausea\/vomiting, particularly after oral therapy, and anaphylactoid reactions which can occur after intravenous therapy and may be life-threatening. INTRAVENOUS: Mild anaphylactoid reactions to intravenous NAC are fairly common, consisting of rash, flushing, urticaria and less often bronchospasm. These reactions most often occur during the initial infusion, and may be related to the dose and rate of administration. SEVERE: More severe reactions such as hypotension occur less often and are usually associated with an inadvertent overdose of intravenous NAC. <br\/>"},{"id":"4590-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>N-ACETYLCYSTEINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: GI decontamination is usually not necessary because many patients experience vomiting with oral NAC.<\/li><li>Support: Anaphylactoid symptoms may develop; monitor patient airway.
