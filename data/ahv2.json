Also used to prolong the effects of insulin (NPH). PHARMACOLOGY: Protamine combines ionically with heparin, forming a stable complex and neutralizing heparin's anticoagulant effect. It also slows the absorption of insulin. TOXICOLOGY: As a weak anticoagulant, it may cause bleeding in overdose. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is extremely rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Protamine, a weak anticoagulant, may cause bleeding following overdose due to interference with both platelet and protein (including fibrinogen) function. This effect must be distinguished from the anticipated anticoagulation response that occurs 30 minutes to 18 hours after the reversal of heparin following protamine administration. Other events that may occur in overdose are likely an extension of adverse effects including: anaphylactoid and anaphylactic reactions such as nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, bradycardia, flushing, warmth and severe hypotension. SEVERE TOXICITY: Bleeding, anaphylactoid or anaphylactic reactions and severe hypotension may occur. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Anaphylactoid and anaphylactic reactions may include nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, bradycardia, flushing, warmth and severe hypotension with rapid intravenous administration of protamine. Anaphylactic reactions require prior exposure and sensitization to initiate IgE mediated mast cell degranulation and histamine release. An anaphylactoid reaction does not require prior sensitization and is triggered instead by non-IgE mechanisms which directly cause the release of these same mediators. <br\/>"},{"id":"ahv2s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PROTAMINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Decontamination is not indicated; protamine is only available parenterally.<\/li><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor for potential bleeding. Following an overdose, protamine can act as a weak anticoagulant by causing interference with platelet function. Obtain baseline CBC (repeat as indicated) and coagulation studies (including APTT, INR). If the patient is receiving heparin, assess if bleeding is secondary to rebound anticoagulation following the reversal of heparin with protamine. Rapid intravenous administration can produce severe hypotension. Monitor blood pressure. Administer IV 0.9% NS at 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, or norepinephrine as indicated. SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive; blood transfusions or fresh frozen plasma may be needed if bleeding severe. An anaphylactoid or anaphylactic reaction may require aggressive airway management and support.<\/li><li>Airway management: Assess airway.  Airway protection may be indicated in patients with signs of anaphylaxis.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Anaphylaxis: MILD\/MODERATE: Monitor airway.

Monitor CBC and coagulation studies.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with protamine overdose should be evaluated and monitored until symptoms resolve.

A toxic dose has not been established. An adult received a total of 300 mg of protamine and developed no adverse effects. A premature infant received a total of 35 mg protamine to treat an inadvertent enoxaparin overdose and developed no adverse events. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Protamine sulfate should be given by slow intravenous administration over a 10 minute period; not to exceed 50 mg. Approximately 1 mg of protamine sulfate (based on a dried basis), neutralizes not less than 100 USP Heparin Units. Dosing of protamine sulfate should be guided by anticoagulation studies. <br\/>"}]},"13":{"id":"ahv2s13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"This drug may cause flushing, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, bradyarrhythmia, or hypotension.<br\/>"}}}
