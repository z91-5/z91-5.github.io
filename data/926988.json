Several transient reactive species are formed, including monoaquo and diaquo diaminocyclohexane (DACH) platinum, which covalently bind with macromolecules. Both inter- and intra-strand Pt-DNA crosslinks are formed. Crosslinks are formed between the N7positions of two adjacent guanines (GG), adjacent adenine-guanines (AG), and guanines separated by an intervening nucleotide (GNG). These crosslinks inhibit DNA replication and transcription. Cytotoxicity is cell-cycle nonspecific. In vivo  studies have shown antitumor activity of oxaliplatin against colon carcinoma. In combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin exhibits in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative activity greater than either compound alone in several tumor models [HT29 (colon), GR (mammary), and L1210 (leukemia)].<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926988-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"926988-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: 440 L <br\/>"},"2":{"id":"926988-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Plasma; nonenzymatic biotransformation, rapid and extensive <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"926988-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Fecal: 2%<\/li><li>Renal: 54%<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"926988-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Total plasma platinum: alpha half-life, 0.43 hrs; beta half-life, 16.8 hrs; gamma half-life, 391 hrs <br\/>"}}},{"id":"926988-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/><ul><li>follow procedures for the handling and disposal of anticancer drugs; use gloves<\/li><li>wash exposed skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water; flush exposed mucous membranes thoroughly with water<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>never use a sodium chloride solution or other chloride-containing solution to dilute injection<\/li><li>dilute solution in 250 to 500 mL D5W; do not use NS<\/li><li>diluted solution is stable for 6 hours at room temperature and 24 hours under refrigeration<\/li><li>do not mix with or administer simultaneously through the same line with alkaline medications (including 5-fluorouracil)<\/li><li>flush infusion lines with D5W prior to administration of any concomitant drug<\/li><li>do not use needles or IV sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with solution; aluminum may degrade platinum compounds<\/li><li>avoid cold temperatures during the infusion<\/li><li>extravasation has been reported, use caution during infusion.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926988-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>evidence of cancer response<\/li><li>CBC with differential; prior to each cycle<\/li><li>blood chemistries, including liver function tests and creatinine; prior to each cycle<\/li><li>presence of unexplained respiratory symptoms<\/li><li>neurologic examination<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926988-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 50 MG, 100 MG<\/li><li>Intravenous Solution: 5 MG\/ML<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Eloxatin<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 5 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926988-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"926988-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>OXALIPLATIN <\/b><br\/>USES: Oxaliplatin is an anticancer agent most commonly used in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for adjuvant therapy of stage III colon cancer and for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. PHARMACOLOGY: Oxaliplatin binds to DNA bases, forming inter- and intra-strand crosslinks, that causes conformational changes, leading to DNA strand breaks and inhibiting DNA synthesis. TOXICOLOGY: An extension of therapeutic effects with inhibition of DNA synthesis affecting rapidly dividing cells first (eg, bone marrow, GI tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Inadvertent iatrogenic overdose has occurred, but is rare. OVERDOSE: Immediate effects (hours to days) include: severe nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, wheezing, laryngospasm, and paresthesias. Bone marrow suppression commonly occurs following overdose but is a delayed effect (days to a week or more). Bradycardia, renal failure, and respiratory failure are less often observed. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects are expected with therapeutic doses. Most often reported are nausea (64%), vomiting (37%), diarrhea (46%), anorexia (20%), myelosuppression, and peripheral neuropathies (mostly sensorineuronal). Two types of peripheral neuropathies may occur: an acute reversible peripheral neuropathy (56% of patients) that occurs within 2 hours to 2 days of dosing, resolves within 14 days, and can recur with continued dosing, and a persistent (greater than 14 days) peripheral neuropathy (48% of patients). Peripheral neuropathy is generally the dose-limiting effect. Hypersensitivity reactions may be observed in patients treated with more than 5 cycles of oxaliplatin therapy.<br\/>"},{"id":"926988-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OXALIPLATIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with normal saline 3 to 6 L per day. Target urine output 1 to 3 mL\/kg\/hr. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes.  Administer granulocyte colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim). MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with normal saline 3 to 6 L per day. Target urine output 1 to 3 mL\/kg\/hr. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs. Administer granulocyte colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim).  Patients with severe neutropenia should be placed in protective isolation. Platelet and red cell transfusions may be necessary. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not helpful since overdose most often occurs by the intravenous route. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal and\/or gastric lavage are not helpful since overdose most often occurs by the intravenous route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Consider orotracheal intubation in patients with significant encephalopathy (ie, agitation, delirium) or respiratory failure.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote for oxaliplatin overdose.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Administer high-dose dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, promethazine or prochlorperazine), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, ondansetron, dolasetron, or granisetron), and\/or antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol); diphenhydramine may be required to prevent dystonic reactions from dopamine antagonists, phenothiazines, and antipsychotics.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Oxaliplatin plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Monitor renal function and hepatic enzymes. Monitor daily CBC with differential to detect bone marrow depression. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Closely monitor fluid and electrolyte status in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor chest radiographs in patients with pulmonary symptoms. Nerve conduction studies may be useful to evaluate neuropathy.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free 0.9% saline).  Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hr).  Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (25 ml FFP\/liter NS) or albumin 5% have also been used for perfusion; may be useful because of high protein binding of oxaliplatin. Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit due to high protein binding and large volume of distribution of oxaliplatin.  Plasma pheresis or plasma exchange might theoretically be of benefit if performed shortly after overdose, but there are no published overdose cases where these methods have been used.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. Patients with oxaliplatin overdose need to be admitted. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved, and monitoring of serum electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic enzymes. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or a poison center for assistance in managing patients with oxaliplatin overdose.
