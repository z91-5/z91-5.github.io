indicated for treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular dysrhythmia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\/flutter and life- threatening ventricular dysrhythmias. PHARMACOLOGY: Flecainide is a IC class antidysrhythmic which causes a decrease in intracardiac conduction for all parts of the heart, with the greatest effect in the His-Purkinje system. It acts by blocking fast sodium channels. Type IC agents slow cardiac conduction and decrease contractility. On an ECG this appears as markedly widened QRS complex, slightly widened QT interval, and PR prolongation from slowed conduction through the AV node. Some proarrhythmic effects may occur with therapeutic use. In overdose situations, these effects are exaggerated. TOXICOLOGY: In overdose situations, the above effects are exaggerated. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare, but life-threatening. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Dizziness, visual disturbances, headache, nausea, fatigue, palpitation, and chest pain. Visual hallucinations and dysarthria may occur at toxic serum concentrations. SEVERE TOXICITY: Seizures, CNS depression, hepatotoxicity, hypotension, ventricular tachydysrhythmias, severe bradycardia, variable degrees of atrioventricular block, marked prolongation of the QRS, QT, and T waves, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, hypokalemia, cardiac arrest. Fatalities have been reported as a consequence of rapid onset hypotension and ventricular dysrhythmias following severe overdoses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dizziness, visual disturbances and dyspnea. Other symptoms occurring in 5% to 10% of patients include headache, nausea, fatigue, palpitation and chest pain.<br\/>"},{"id":"234185-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FLECAINIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treat seizures with benzodiazepines. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat ventricular dysrhythmias with sodium bicarbonate, correct electrolyte abnormalities, and perform cardioversion for unstable rhythms. Consider intravenous lipid therapy early for patients with ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension. Antidysrhythmic drugs are generally not effective, and some (procainamide, disopyramide, encainide, sotalol, propafenone) should be avoided. Consider extracorporeal support (cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, aortic balloon pump) early in unstable patients. Treat torsades de pointes with magnesium and overdrive pacing. Intubate patients with hemodynamic instability, dysrhythmias or CNS depression. Treat hypotension initially with IV fluids, then vasopressors if necessary. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines, add propofol or barbiturates if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of potential for CNS depression, seizures, and cardiovascular instability. HOSPITAL: Consider gastric lavage after ingestion of a potentially life-threatening amount of poison if it can be performed soon after ingestion (generally within 1 hour) and the airway is protected. Consider activated charcoal in patients with a potentially toxic ingestion who are awake and able to protect their airway. Because of the potential for abrupt onset of hemodynamic instability or seizures, consider intubating the patient to protect the airway first. Most effective when administered within one hour of ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with excessive drowsiness, seizures, hemodynamic instability or the inability to protect their own airway.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Initial treatment with sodium bicarbonate boluses to decrease the amount of sodium channel blockade. Frequent ECGs and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor arterial blood gases to target pH 7.45 to 7.55. Ventricular tachycardia induced by flecainide has been difficult to treat and refractory to conventional antidysrhythmic drug therapy, cardioversion, and ventricular pacing. Minimize aggravating conditions for dysrhythmias (eg, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia). Consider intravenous lipid therapy for patients with ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension. Avoid drugs with similar sodium channel blocking effects. Antidysrhythmics are rarely effective. Consider overdrive transvenous pacing. Avoid procainamide and disopyramide as they may worsen flecainide-induced dysrhythmias. Institute cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or intra-aortic balloon pump early for patients with persistent hemodynamic instability. The goal is to support the patient hemodynamically while the flecainide is metabolized.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium and\/or atrial overdrive pacing. Correct electrolyte abnormalities (ie, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia) and hypoxia. Avoid class Ia (eg, quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class IC (eg, flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (eg, N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Fat emulsion: Patients who develop significant cardiovascular toxicity should be treated with intravenous lipids. Administer 1.5 mL\/kg of 20% lipid emulsion over 2 to 3 minutes as an IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min. If possible, discontinue after 30 to 60 minutes. Longer periods of lipid therapy should be considered if the patient's hemodynamic stability is dependent on continued lipid infusion.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Maintain ventilation and oxygenation and evaluate with frequent arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry. Early use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and mechanical ventilation may be needed.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Administer isotonic IV fluids for hypotension. Consider vasopressors for persistent hypotension.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, obtain serial ECGs, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor serum electrolytes and acid\/base balance. Monitor for seizures and CNS depression following substantial overdoses. While flecainide concentrations can be measured, they are not rapidly available and not useful to guide overdose treatment. A therapeutic level is estimated at 0.2 to 1 mcg\/mL; levels greater than 1.5 mcg\/mL may be considered toxic.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Methods to enhance elimination such as hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are ineffective due to the drug's large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management of flecainide overdose. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with overdose (including children with inadvertent exposures) should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Because of the potential for abrupt instability, patients should be transferred by ambulance. Patients should be observed for at least 6 hours after exposure. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All patients who are symptomatic should be admitted to an intensive care setting for at least 24 hours. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist for assistance with medical management.
