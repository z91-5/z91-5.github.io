Auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total. The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued. Neurotoxicity can occur and may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. Renal and eighth-nerve toxicities should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment. Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Drug accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and\/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides, should be avoided. Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tobramycin and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after administration of antibacterial agents.<br\/>"},{"id":"616035-s-3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"616035-s-3-9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside  or component of the product <br\/>"},{"id":"616035-s-3-10","title":"Precautions","mono":"<ul><li>Gastrointestinal:<\/li><li>-- Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea may occur<\/li><li>Immunological:<\/li><li>-- severe and sometimes fatal allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions (eg, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), have been reported<\/li><li>-- cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur<\/li><li>-- topical sensitivity reaction may occur<\/li><li>-- sulfite sensitivity;

Also used topically to treat or prevent skin infections and as eye drops or ointment for bacterial conjunctivitis. PHARMACOLOGY: Aminoglycosides function by binding the aminoacyl site of 16S ribosomal RNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit. This binding results in the misreading of genetic code, inhibition of translocation, and bacterial cell death. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Given that aminoglycosides (with the exception of neomycin) are only available in parenteral, topical, and ophthalmic forms, overdoses are almost entirely the result of dosing errors. Overdoses are rarely life-threatening and typically require minimal intervention. Ingestions of ophthalmic or topical preparations do not cause toxicity related to the aminoglycoside. Although neomycin is available orally, oral absorption is low and acute toxicity from overdosage is unlikely. OVERDOSE: Toxicity is more closely associated with trough levels of the drug than peak levels. Renal damage (acute tubular necrosis; usually reversible), ototoxicity (irreversible), and vestibular toxicity (irreversible) are most common. Renal injury may often go unnoticed until significant injury has occurred, given the delay between when renal injury occurs and when the elevation in creatinine is evident. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Retinopathy and visual loss with intraocular administration. Apnea and neuromuscular blockade may occur when aminoglycosides are given rapidly IV with neuromuscular blocking agents, due to aminoglycosides' inhibition of acetylcholine release from presynaptic nerve terminals; patients with abnormal neuromuscular junction function (eg, myasthenia gravis, botulism) can develop respiratory failure or weakness after use of aminoglycosides alone. Rash and hypersensitivity reactions can occur.<br\/>"},{"id":"616035-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AMINOGLYCOSIDES<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
