ADVERSE EFFECTS: Based on its pharmacodynamic effect, hypocalcemia may be anticipated with therapy. The most frequently reported adverse effects reported with cinacalcet use are nausea (31%) and vomiting (27%). Other symptoms reported with therapeutic use include: headache, paraesthesias, fatigue, diarrhea, anxiety, anorexia, myalgia, dizziness, hypertension, asthenia, and non-cardiac chest pain.
