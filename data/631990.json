It elevates bicarbonate anion concentration by binding to hydrogen ions of carbonic acid. It also exhibits an osmotic diuretic activity which increases urine flow, urinary pH and excretes fixed acids, carbon dioxide and electrolytes.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"631990-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"3":{"id":"631990-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Renal: 75% <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"631990-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>avoid perivascular infiltration because solution is alkaline, infuse slowly and do not exceed a max of 35 g\/h<\/li><li>(peripheral infusion) indwelling catheter preferred, place in a large vein of an elevated limb<\/li><li>(peripheral infusion) if an indwelling catheter is not used, place a large needle in the largest antecubital vein of an elevated limb<\/li><li>(cardiac bypass) if chest is closed, give as peripheral infusion<\/li><li>(cardiac bypass, ACD blood acidity correction) add 2 g (62 mL) to 500 mL of the ACD blood used to prime the pump-oxygenator<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Intraventricular<\/b><br\/>(cardiac bypass) if chest is open, inject directly into ventricular cavity; do not inject into cardiac muscle<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"631990-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>blood pH, pCO2, pO2, serum bicarbonate, blood glucose, electrolyte panel; baseline, during and after administration<\/li><li>urine output; baseline, during and after administration<\/li><li>serum potassium, ECG; in patients with renal disease or reduced urine output<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"631990-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Tham<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 3.6 GM\/100 ML<br\/>"}}}
