PHARMACOLOGY: Panitumumab is a recombinant, human IgG2 kappa monoclonal antibody and binds to human EGFR specifically, on both normal and tumor cells. Panitumumab competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdoses are rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Skin toxicity, diarrhea, dehydration and fatigue have been reported in patients receiving doses up to approximately twice the recommended therapeutic dose (12 mg\/kg).  SEVERE TOXICITY: No severe toxicity were reported following doses of approximately twice the recommended therapeutic dose (12 mg\/kg). ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dermatologic effects develop in most (90%) patients and include: erythema (65%), acneiform dermatitis (57%), pruritus (57%), nail changes (29%), paronychia (25%), exfoliation (25%), skin fissures (20%), and dry skin (10%). Other adverse effects include: hypomagnesemia (38%), fatigue (26%), abdominal pain (25%), nausea\/vomiting (23% and 19%), diarrhea (21%), constipation (21%) and cough (14%). Less common adverse effects include hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, cheilitis, ocular toxicities (e.g. conjunctivitis, ocular hyperemia, increased lacrimation, eye\/eyelid irritation, and eyelash growth), thrombophlebitis, bone pain, back pain, asthenia, dyspnea, and infectious complications. Rare, but serious complications include pulmonary fibrosis and infusion-related toxicity  (e.g. anaphylactoid reactions, bronchospasm, hypotension). <br\/>"},{"id":"928625-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PANITUMUMAB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In patients with infusion reactions, permanent discontinuation of panitumumab may be required depending on the severity and\/or persistence of the reaction.
