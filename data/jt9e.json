Specifically, follitropin alfa, a recombinant FSH, stimulates follicle recruitment and follicular growth and maturation. Follitropin alfa's ability to increase serum concentrations of inhibin, estradiol, and total ovarian follicular volume varies widely among individuals. The rise in the serum inhibin concentration is an early indicator of follicular development; its concentration declines quickly after follitropin alfa treatment is discontinued. Total growth of ovarian follicles lags behind increasing FSH serum concentrations, and ovarian follicular growth continues to increase for a time with declining FSH serum concentrations. Maximum ovarian follicular volume correlates better with inhibin or estradiol serum concentrations than it does with FSH serum concentrations.   Anovulatory patients who need luteinizing hormone (LH) activity at mid-cycle receive an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to stimulate ovulation and to continue follicular maturation. Follitropin alfa is not useful for patients experiencing infertility due to primary ovarian failure. <\/li><li>Before consecutive administration of gonadotropins as single agents to increase recruitment of multiple follicles, some assisted reproductive technology protocols include pretreatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to suppress the pituitary release of gonadotropins. Once the pituitary is suppressed, the patient's physiologic concentrations of gonadotropins are then replaced. <\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"jt9es8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"jt9es8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Not been studied <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"jt9es8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Renal, 12.5% <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"jt9es9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Subcutaneous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>dissolve each single-dose vial in 1 mL Sterile Water for Injection<\/li><li>gently roll vial between fingers to mix, do not shake<\/li><li>injection sites include skin on the stomach, upper arm and upper leg; rotate injection location daily<\/li><li>use immediately following reconstitution<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jt9es10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"serum progesterone, luteinizing hormone, serum estradiol, ovarian ultrasound, pelvic exam, onset of ovulation <br\/>"},"11":{"id":"jt9es11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject<\/b><br\/>Subcutaneous Solution: 300 IU\/0.5 ML, 450 IU\/0.75 ML, 900 IU\/1.5 ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Gonal-F RFF<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Subcutaneous Powder for Solution: 75 IU<\/li><li>Subcutaneous Solution: 300 IU\/0.5 ML, 900 IU\/1.5 ML, 450 IU\/0.75 ML<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Gonal-F<\/b><br\/>Subcutaneous Powder for Solution: 450 IU, 1050 IU<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"jt9es13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>This drug may cause abdominal pain, nausea, or headache.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report signs\/symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (abdominal bloating\/distension, lower abdominal pain, dyspnea, decreased urination).<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of pulmonary or vascular problems such as upper respiratory infection, arterial thromboembolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or atelectasis.<\/li><li>Teach patient proper technique and placement of injections.<\/li><li>Advise patient to rotate injection sites.<\/li><li>Advise patient to call healthcare professional if a dose is missed, as drug should be given on a regular schedule.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
