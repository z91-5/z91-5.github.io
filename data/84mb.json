PHARMACOLOGY: The exact mechanism of action of mitotane is not known. It does cause cytotoxic atrophy of the adrenal cells which is associated with unresponsiveness to ACTH administration. In addition, mitotane, in an independent manner, appears to alter the pattern of corticoid metabolism. Mitotane reduced the excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids without concomitant reductions in plasma cortisol or cortisol secretion rates, as well as, increased the formation of 6-beta-hydroxyl cortisol. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited.  Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON; about 80%: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea; 15% to 40%: CNS depression (eg; lethargy, somnolence, dizziness or vertigo), and skin rashes. INFREQUENT: Ocular effects (eg, blurred vision, diplopia, lens opacity, and retinopathy), hematuria, hemorrhagic cystitis, albuminuria, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, flushing, and hyperpyrexia. <br\/>"},{"id":"84mbs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MITOTANE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and aspiration.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and CNS depression.
