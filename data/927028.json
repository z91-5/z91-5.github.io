In children, it as been used for treatment of aggression, conduct disorder, Tourette syndrome, bipolar I disorder, irritability associated with autistic disorder, and schizophrenia. PHARMACOLOGY: Aripiprazole is a quinolinone antipsychotic that has moderate to high affinity to various dopaminergic and serotonin receptors as well as H1 and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. It also has moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake transporter and acts as a partial agonist at the D2 and 5-HT1a receptors and as an antagonist at the 5-HT2a receptor. TOXICOLOGY: Aripiprazole exerts its toxicity through the above effects on the various receptors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is fairly common; severe toxicity is rare and fatalities have not been reported from overdose with aripiprazole alone. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In overdose, the most prominent effect seen is CNS sedation. After a mild to moderate exposure, other symptoms reported have included tachycardia, tremors, irritability, and nausea\/vomiting. SEVERE TOXICITY: More severe effects reported from aripiprazole overdoses\/exposures include hypotension, coma, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse reactions include CNS symptoms (headache, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, sedation) and gastrointestinal symptoms (weight gain, nausea, constipation, vomiting, dyspepsia). LESS FREQUENT: Other rarer adverse effects include other CNS symptoms (dizziness, pyrexia, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, lightheadedness, pain, dystonia, hypersomnia, irritability, impaired coordination, suicidal ideation), cardiovascular symptoms (orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, chest pain, hypertension, peripheral edema), dermatologic symptoms (rash, hyperhidrosis), gastrointestinal symptoms (increased salivation, decreased appetite, increased appetite, xerostomia, toothache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight gain), neuromuscular and skeletal symptoms (tremor, extremity pain, stiffness, myalgias, spasm, arthralgias, dyskinesia, increased creatine phosphokinase, weakness), and respiratory symptoms (nasopharyngitis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, cough, rhinorrhea).<br\/>"},{"id":"927028-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ARIPIPRAZOLE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: For management of mild to moderate toxicity, good supportive care is all that is needed. Treatment may include fluids and antiemetics for patients with nausea and vomiting or benzodiazepines for agitation. For drug-induced dystonia, treatment includes benztropine and diphenhydramine. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Mainstay of treatment is good supportive care, including airway management for patients with severe CNS sedation and fluid and vasopressors for hypotension. For patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, standard treatments include sedation with benzodiazepines, bromocriptine, and dantrolene (used in severe cases), and good supportive care including cooling methods for hyperthermia.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Ipecac-induced emesis is not recommended due to potential for CNS depression. Activated charcoal may be considered if the patient is awake, alert, cooperative, and able to tolerate the charcoal orally without difficulty, and the ingestion is recent (within the last hour). HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal could be considered if the patient is awake, alert, and cooperative, and the ingestion is relatively recent (within the last hour).<\/li><li>Airway management: Most patients do not require advanced airway management and there is no indication for early intubation, but patients who have enough CNS depression and have trouble maintaining their airway require intubation.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and neurologic exam (for CNS depression, akathisia, or extrapyramidal effects). Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with severe vomiting. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients. Serum aripiprazole concentrations are not widely available or useful in guiding management.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no evidence for the use of dialysis, hemoperfusion, urinary alkalinization, or multiple dose activated charcoal. Due to the large volume of distribution and high protein binding of aripiprazole, dialysis or hemoperfusion are unlikely to be helpful.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  Children less than 12 years of age who are naive to aripiprazole can be observed at home following an unintentional ingestion of 15 mg or less and are only experiencing mild sedation. All patients, 12 years of age or older, who are naive to aripiprazole, can be observed at home following an unintentional ingestion of 50 mg or less and are experiencing only mild sedation. All patients who are taking aripiprazole on a chronic basis can be observed at home if they have acutely ingested no more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) of aripiprazole. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with a deliberate ingestion or more than minor symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility. Children less than 12 years of age who are naive to aripiprazole should be referred to a healthcare facility following an unintentional ingestion of 15 mg or more. All patients, 12 years of age or older, who are naive to aripiprazole should be referred to a healthcare facility following an unintentional ingestion of more than 50 mg. All patients who are taking aripiprazole on a chronic basis should be referred to a healthcare facility following an acute ingestion of more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) of aripiprazole. Patients should be observed for a period of 8 to 10 hours (due to possible delayed presentation of symptoms), and if asymptomatic or with improving symptoms, can be potentially discharged or cleared for psychiatry. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with worsening symptoms after a period of observation or not clinically safe to discharge should be admitted to the hospital. Most patients should be able to be admitted to a regular ward bed. However, patients with extreme somnolence that may necessitate advanced airway management or have severe symptoms (ie, neuroleptic malignant syndrome) should be admitted to the ICU. Patients should not be discharged until they are clearly improving and clinically stable.
