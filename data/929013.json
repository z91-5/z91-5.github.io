It is an endogenous coronary vasodilator and used for thallium stress testing. Regadenoson is a low affinity adenosine receptor agonist producing coronary vasodilation and increasing coronary blood flow used for myocardial perfusion imaging. PHARMACOLOGY: Adenosine depresses calcium-mediated slow-channel conduction and increases potassium conductance, thus depressing automaticity of the sinus node, Purkinje fibers, AV nodal conduction, and shortening and hyperpolarizing the atrial action potential. TOXICOLOGY: Overdose information is limited. In large doses, cardiac effects can occur which include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, bradycardia, and angina-like chest pain. However, adenosine has an ultra-short half-life which limits its toxicity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Adenosine is commonly used, but toxicity is rarely seen. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild toxicity can consist of hypotension, dyspnea, vomiting and retching, facial flushing, headaches, and irritability. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity can cause bradycardia, sinus arrest, atrioventricular block, ventricular dysrhythmias, and bronchospasm. Seizures are rarely reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Hypotension, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, dizziness, facial flushing, and irritability have occurred with therapeutic dosing.<br\/>"},{"id":"929013-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ADENOSINE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment for mild to moderate toxicity is symptomatic and supportive care. Duration of effect is extremely short, so treatment is usually unnecessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Duration is extremely short, so effects are typically self-limiting and short. However, if severe toxicity develops, support respiratory and cardiovascular function. Aminophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, has been used for regadenoson toxicity.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated as these agents are administered parenterally.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management may be needed if cardiovascular compromise develops, but this is rare.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote for adenosine. Aminophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, has been used following regadenoson adverse reactions, at doses ranging from 50 to 250 mg IV, administered over 30 to 60 seconds.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No routine laboratory evaluation is indicated. If dysrhythmias develop, monitor electrolytes. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis or other methods of enhanced elimination are not recommended.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: These medications are administered parenterally in a healthcare setting. There is no role for home management. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who develop adverse effects need to be observed in the emergency department until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe or prolonged symptoms, those who develop new dysrhythmias, or requiring medication treatment should be admitted for further observation. CONSULT CRITERIA: Medical toxicology should be consulted in large and\/or severe symptomatic exposures.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929013-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ADENOSINE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADENOSINE: There is no data for a minimal toxic or lethal dose for adenosine.
