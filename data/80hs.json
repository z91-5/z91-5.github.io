PHARMACOLOGY: Mexiletine hydrochloride is a local anesthetic and Class 1B antiarrhythmic agent that has structural and pharmacological similarities to lidocaine, but dissimilar from quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide. Mexiletine hydrochloride reduces the rate of rise of the action potential, Phase 0, by inhibiting the inward sodium current. The drug lowers the effective refractory period (ERP) in Purkinje fibers to a lesser degree than the reduction in action potential duration (APD), resulting in an increase in the ERP\/APD ratio. Mexiletine has no significant negative inotropic effect. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, paresthesias of the tongue, agitation, hallucinations, nausea. SEVERE TOXICITY: Bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, sinus arrest, nodal and ventricular dysrhythmias, QRS widening, respiratory failure, seizures, asystole, cardiovascular collapse, coma.  ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, hiccup, unpleasant taste, dizziness, lightheadedness, tremors, nervousness, coordination difficulties, ataxia, confusion, and nervousness. RARE: Blurred vision\/visual disturbances, hypotension, dysrhythmias (eg, bradycardia, sinus arrest, AV nodal or ventricular rhythms, second and third degree heart block, and asystole), ECG changes (eg, heart block [increased PR interval] or conduction delay [increased QRS interval]), rash, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, elevated liver enzymes, hepatic necrosis, seizures, hypersensitivity reactions, pulmonary infiltration or pulmonary fibrosis. <br\/>"},{"id":"80hss12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MEXILETINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  The primary areas of concern are reversal of heart block, controlling seizures, and maintenance of respiratory and CNS status. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Control agitation and confusion with benzodiazepines. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Treat hypotension with IV fluids, add norepinephrine or dopamine if hypotension persists. Treat bradycardia with temporary pacemaker (first choice), atropine, or isoproterenol. Monitor for atrioventricular conduction disturbances or heart block. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required. Treat QRS widening with intravenous bicarbonate. Consider hemodialysis or circulatory support (intra-aortic balloon pump, cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) in patients with severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with serious toxicity or life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 mL to 20 mL\/kg, add norepinephrine or dopamine if unresponsive.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Bradycardia: Insertion of a temporary pacemaker is the treatment of choice for bradycardia induced by drugs of this class. Also consider atropine or isoproterenol. In one case report, isoproterenol was administered along with epinephrine to reverse heart block after a 4.4 gram ingestion of mexiletine and was unsuccessful.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Administer sodium bicarbonate for QRS widening. 1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV is a reasonable starting dose. Monitor arterial blood gases, titrate to pH of 7.45 to 7.55. Cardiovert unstable rhythms. Institute cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or aortic balloon pump for patients with refractory dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Mexiletine has a protein binding of approximately 50% to 60% and volume of distribution of 5 to 7 liters\/kg. Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of value because of the large volume of distribution.  A man ingested 4 g of mexiletine and developed hypotension, bradycardia, stupor, and dysarthria. He underwent hemodialysis 3 hours postingestion and his condition improved rapidly but dialytic clearance was not calculated.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain serial ECGs, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, CBC and liver enzymes following a significant exposure.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All overdose patients should be referred to a healthcare facility to be monitored for several hours to assess cardiac function. Patients that remain asymptomatic after 6 hours can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent cardiac dysrhythmias, mental status changes, seizures, and respiratory failure should be admitted to an ICU setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: A medical toxicologist or poison control center should be consulted in cases that involve cardiac or CNS toxicity, or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"80hss12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MEXILETINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Therapeutic blood concentration is 1 to 2 mcg\/mL. Blood concentration twice the therapeutic range resulted in only mild symptoms. Levels of 34 to 37 mcg\/mL were found in a fatal case. ADULTS: A fatality was reported after ingestion of 4.4 g. Ingestions of 1.8 to 2.4 grams resulted in only mild CNS symptoms. An overdose of 18 g resulted in repetitive seizures in a woman.  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her hospital course. A man who took 12.4 grams of mexiletine, along with nifedipine and nitroglycerin, experienced a seizure and second and third degree AV block, but fully recovered. ADOLESCENT: An overdose of 8 g resulted in cardiac arrest and survival in a 17-year-old. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: ADULTS: Loading dose: 400 mg orally; maintenance, 200 to 300 mg orally every 8 hours; MAX 1200 mg\/day. CHILDREN: The manufacturer indicated that safety and efficacy of mexiletine have not been established in children. However, mexiletine oral doses of 1.4 to 5 mg\/kg\/dose (mean: 3.3 mg\/kg\/dose) every 8 hours have been used in children.
