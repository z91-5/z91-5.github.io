It is also used in combination with other agents as an abuse deterrent. PHARMACOLOGY: Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that competes with and displaces narcotics at opioid receptor sites. TOXICOLOGY: The antagonistic effects of naloxone at opioid receptors may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose of naloxone is rare. It is used commonly in a variety of settings including prehospital care settings, emergency departments, and operating rooms. OVERDOSE: Naloxone is not a drug of abuse and there is essentially no overdose phenomenon. Increased blood pressure may occur following overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The adverse effects of naloxone are related to its antagonistic effects to narcotics and the resulting withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms include pain, hypertension, diaphoresis, piloerection, muscle cramping, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and agitation. Pulmonary edema and dysrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in association with the use of naloxone. There have also been reports of acute lung injury, seizures, dysphagia, urinary urgency, and increases of cortisol and growth hormone. NEONATES: In neonates, withdrawal symptoms also include excessive crying, hyperactive reflexes, and convulsions.<br\/><\/li><li><b>PENTAZOCINE <\/b><br\/>USES: Pentazocine is a semisynthetic opioid primarily used for treatment of mild to moderate pain. It is also abused for its euphoric effects. Pentazocine is also available in combination with acetaminophen or naloxone. Refer to &quot;NALOXONE&quot; AND &quot;ACETAMINOPHEN-ACUTE&quot; managements for more information. PHARMACOLOGY: In therapeutic doses pentazocine stimulates opioid receptors. It is a mixed agonist-antagonist. It stimulates kappa opioid receptors and delta opioid receptors. It antagonizes mu opioid receptors. TOXICOLOGY: In overdose, pentazocine causes respiratory depression. Unlike other opioids, pentazocine may not cause miosis in overdose. It may precipitate withdrawal in opioid abusing patients. It causes more dysphoria due to its kappa opioid receptor affinity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure to pentazocine is now uncommon. Pentazocine abuse in conjunction with tripelennamine (T's and Blues) was once very common. Since the addition of naloxone to pentazocine tablets in the US, abuse is now rare. Severe toxicity is rare. Deaths have been reported secondary to respiratory depression. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Pentazocine produces CNS depression, dysphoria, and psychotomimetic effects (ie, hallucinations, paranoia, feeling of impending doom, anxiety, terror). It can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid addicted patient. Talc granulomas are occasionally encountered on autopsy of pentazocine abusers who inject crushed tablets, but they are of uncertain clinical significance. Hypertension, hypotension, and tachycardia may occur with overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Unlike most other opioids, there appears to be a ceiling effect on the respiratory depression due to pentazocine. However, fatal respiratory depression has occurred in patients abusing oral pentazocine preparations intravenously. Coma and seizures have been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects are similar to morphine, including CNS depression, constipation, and nausea and vomiting. Hallucinations and dysphoria can occur more frequently than with other opioids. Pentazocine therapy is infrequently associated with the development of hypotension, hypertension, circulatory depression, and shock.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"453390-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>NALOXONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treatment of mild to moderate withdrawal induced by naloxone includes the use of benzodiazepines for agitation and antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. Because naloxone has a short duration of action compared with most opioids, no further treatment is generally needed. In mild cases, symptoms usually subside within 1 to 2 hours. Clonidine has also been used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine has been used to treat diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include benzodiazepines for agitation and antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. Because naloxone has a short duration of action compared with most opioids, no further treatment is generally needed. In mild cases, symptoms usually subside within 1 to 2 hours. Clonidine has also been used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine to treat diarrhea. If pulmonary edema develops, oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure, or endotracheal intubation may be required. Seizures should be treated with standard antiepileptic agents such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route. HOSPITAL: Because naloxone is not active orally, gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation. Provide bilevel positive airway pressure as required and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with pulmonary edema or serious toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension does not usually require treatment. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside or phentolamine are preferred, with nitroglycerin or labetalol as alternatives.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No laboratory studies are needed after naloxone use or overdose unless otherwise clinically indicated. Naloxone concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful. Monitor respiratory and mental status when naloxone is used to reverse opioid toxicity.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Naloxone exposures in general should be very safe. Asymptomatic patients may remain at home with inadvertent exposures to naloxone alone. However, if naloxone was administered to reverse opioid toxicity, the patient should be brought in to a health care facility for further evaluation. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who are symptomatic, those with deliberate overdose, and patients in whom naloxone was used to reverse opioid toxicity should be referred to a health care facility for evaluation and observation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with pulmonary edema or those who are persistently symptomatic should be admitted. Admission is almost never necessary. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a toxicologist or a poison center for advice if there are concerns.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>PENTAZOCINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Patients may require benzodiazepines or antipsychotics for control of psychotomimetic symptoms. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Respiratory depression should be treated with naloxone. Patients may require larger than usual doses (up to 10 to 15 mg) before response is achieved. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended in the prehospital setting because of the risk of aspiration.

Patients with severe serotonin syndrome (ie, severe hyperthermia, agitation, rigidity, hypertension, tachycardia, acidosis) may require neuromuscular paralysis.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Administer oxygen. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or orotracheal intubation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often necessary.<\/li><li>Injury of artery: Intravenous heparin and vasodilators may help reduce arterial spasm and thrombosis after intra-arterial injection.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: A large volume of distribution and an effective antidote limit the utility of enhanced elimination.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor for respiratory depression. No specific testing is necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Drug levels are generally not available in a clinically relevant time frame. Consider a chest x-ray for talc foreign body reaction in lungs of chronic IV pentazocine abusers.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients using pentazocine or other opioids chronically that ingest an extra dose of pentazocine and are asymptomatic may remain at home. Symptomatic adults, adult patients with no prior opioid use who have ingested more than a therapeutic doses, and all exposed children should seek medical care. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be observed in the emergency department until asymptomatic. Patients receiving naloxone should be observed for at least 3 to 4 hours after their dose of naloxone, as symptoms may recur. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients presenting comatose should be admitted, even if symptoms reverse with naloxone. Prolonged or repeated naloxone administration with respiratory monitoring may be necessary. CONSULT CRITERIA: Patients with atypical symptoms, or respiratory depression resistant to normal doses of naloxone warrant consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison center.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"453390-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>NALOXONE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: There is no specific known toxic dose with naloxone, though deaths have occurred in varying doses associated with its use. However, these case reports do not provide any direct evidence that the use of naloxone was solely responsible for mortality. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT: Standard dosing in adults may range widely, as the drug should be titrated to effect. Initial IV doses usually range from 0.1 to 2 mg, which may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes. Additional doses may be needed every 20 to 60 minutes. Atypical opioids (eg, fentanyl, propoxyphene) or massive opioid overdoses may require much larger doses to reverse respiratory depression. In addition, to avoid precipitating acute withdrawal lower doses should be titrated incrementally in opioid-dependent patients. Continuous infusion of naloxone has also been used for respiratory depression with one suggestion of using 2\/3 of the initial effective naloxone bolus per hour with titrations to effect. INTRANASAL: Intranasal dosing is usually 2 mg (1mg\/nostril) with repeat dosing every 5 minutes if respiratory depression continues. PEDIATRIC\/PALS GUIDELINES: Pediatric dosing is initially 0.1 mg\/kg to a maximum of 2 mg and repeated every 2 to 5 minutes as needed. ALTERNATIVE DOSING: In cases of known or suspected chronic opioid therapy, a lower dose of 0.01 mg\/kg may be considered and titrated to effect to avoid withdrawal.<br\/><\/li><li><b>PENTAZOCINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Poorly defined.
