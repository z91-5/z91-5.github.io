Profound hypotension (especially orthostatic) and shock are the most severe signs of toxicity following overdosage. ADVERSE EFFECTS: A transient episode of early hypertension may be noted prior to the onset of hypotension.  Hypertensive crisis due to sensitization by guanethidine to some indirect acting sympathomimetics (metaraminol and ephedrine) may occur. <br\/>"},{"id":"5olxs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>GUANETHIDINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Consider activated charcoal if patient is able to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Support: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl 10 to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine.

Monitor central venous or pulmonary wedge pressure in severely hypotensive patients. No specific lab work (CBC, urinalysis, electrolytes) is needed unless otherwise indicated. Due to the prolonged duration of action, symptomatic patients should be admitted, with continuous cardiac monitoring. Normal homeostatic mechanisms gradually return over approximately 72 hours.  Asymptomatic patients should be observed with cardiac monitoring for a minimum of 6 hours after overdose.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"5olxs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>GUANETHIDINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Range of toxicity is not well described.
