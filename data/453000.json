prevention or treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. PHARMACOLOGY: Pentamidine isethionate, an aromatic diamidine, is a nonpyrogenic, lyophilized, antifungal agent that interferes with microbial nuclear metabolism by inhibiting DNA, RNA, phospholipid, and protein synthesis. The mode of action is not completely understood. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose information is limited.  Clinical events following exposure are anticipated to be an extension of adverse events. A child developed severe hypotension and cardiac arrest after inadvertently receiving 1600 mg of pentamidine (40 times the recommended dose of 4 mg\/kg).  ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Rash, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and pharyngitis. INFREQUENT\/RARE: Bronchospasm, dyspnea, headache, hypotension, prolonged QT, cardiac arrest, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia (infrequent), hypocalcemia, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, nephritis, conjunctivitis, blurred vision, and blepharitis, granulocytopenia, neutropenia, megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, dizziness, paresthesia, neuropathy, neuralgia, seizures, tremors, ataxia, amnesia, depression, confusion, hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, vertigo, drowsiness, and pneumothorax. <br\/>"},{"id":"453000-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PENTAMIDINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Myelosuppression has rarely been reported. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding. Therapeutic doses of pentamidine may cause prolongation of the QT interval or torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias using ACLS protocols.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral and inhalation routes.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, severe respiratory distress, or hemodynamic instability.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Pentamidine may have proarrhythmic activity. QT prolongation has been reported following therapeutic use. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Consider lidocaine. Because pentamidine has caused QT prolongation, amiodarone should be used with extreme caution. Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary. AVOID: Class Ia (eg, quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (eg, flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (eg, sotalol).<\/li><li>Hypoglycemia: DEXTROSE: Give dextrose if symptomatic or BS less than 60 mg\/dL. DOSE: ADULT: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg of D50W (50% dextrose) IV push; ADOLESCENT: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (1 to 2 mL\/kg) of 50% dextrose IV push; INFANT and CHILD: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (2 to 4 mL\/kg) of 25% dextrose IV push. Follow with an infusion of 10% dextrose; titrate to a BS of 100 mg\/dL. DIET: When the patient is awake and alert, supplement IV glucose with carbohydrate intake.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring as an increase in the QT interval and dysrhythmias may develop following pentamidine exposure. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count, serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Monitor blood glucose. Monitor pulse oximetry and\/or arterial blood gases in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is likely not to be of value because of the large volume of distribution. Charcoal hemoperfusion stabilized one pediatric patient following an accidental overdose with pentamidine.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure to the inhalation product, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent cardiac dysrhythmias, severe respiratory symptoms, or severe neutropenia should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"453000-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PENTAMIDINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY:  A 17-month-old child developed severe hypotension and cardiac arrest after inadvertently receiving 160 mg\/kg of pentamidine (40 times the recommended dose of 4 mg\/kg; total dose: 1600 mg).
