DERMATOLOGIC: Various dermatological reactions, including rash, pruritus, erythema nodosum, and quite severe and often fatal erythema multiforme of the Stevens-Johnson type have been reported. Lyell's Syndromes are usually associated with the use of a long-acting sulfonamides. GASTROINTESTINAL: Nausea and vomiting are common.
