When used in anterior segment surgeries, it allows for more efficient manipulation with less trauma to the ocular tissues, such as the corneal endothelium, by maintaining a deep chamber.   The viscoelastic properties of hypromellose facilitates pushing back the vitreous face, which prevents the formation of a postoperative flat chamber.  <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"922178-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"922178-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"not absorbed into ocular tissues <br\/>"},"2":{"id":"922178-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"hypromellose is not metabolized <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"922178-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intraocular<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(Cellugel(R) OVD) inject sterile irrigating solution into the cannula hub and fill to the top<\/li><li>(Cellugel(R) OVD) purge all the air prior to use<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) use solution according to standard technique of operating surgeon<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) follow strict aseptic techniques during reconstitution<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) not for injection or intravenous infusion<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) do not use unless product is clear, seal is intact, vacuum is present and container is undamaged<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) reconstitute just prior to surgery; use within 6 hours of mixing<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) do not use until Part I of solution is fully reconstituted with Part II<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) remove blue flip-off seals from both Part I bottle and Part II vial; prepare stoppers with sterile alcohol wipes<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) insert vacuum transfer device by inserting the white piercing pin into the Part II vial<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) invert Part II vial and immediately insert filter needle into the Part I bottle; fluid from Part II vial will automatically transfer into Part I bottle<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) an excess amount of solution is provided in each vial; a small amount of residual volume may remain in vial<\/li><li>(Navstel(R) Solution) place sterile safety cap over rubber stopper on Part I bottle if solution is not going to be used immediately; mix solution gently until uniform<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"922178-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"intraocular pressure post-surgically <br\/>"},"11":{"id":"922178-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 0.4 %, 2.5 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Cellugel Ovd<\/b><br\/>Intraocular Solution: 2 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>GenTeal<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Ophthalmic Gel\/Jelly: 0.3 %<\/li><li>Ophthalmic Solution: 0.2 %, 0.3 %<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Gonak<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 2.5 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Goniosoft<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 2.5 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Goniovisc<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 2.5 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Isopto Tears<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 0.5 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Nature's Tears<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 0.4 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Pure &amp; Gentle<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 0.3 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Systane<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Gel\/Jelly: 0.3 %<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"922178-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patient should report blurred vision or signs\/symptoms of an eye infection or injury.<\/li><li>Instruct patient on proper instillation technique.<\/li><li>Advise patient to remove contact lenses prior to instilling drug.
