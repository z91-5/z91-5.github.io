Corticosteroids are available in oral, parenteral, inhalational, and topical formulations. PHARMACOLOGY: Multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions. Anti-inflammatory effects result from decreased formation, release and activity of the mediators of inflammation (eg, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) which reduced the initial manifestations of the inflammatory process. The immunosuppressive properties decrease the response to delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, type III and type IV).  The antiproliferative effects reduce hyperplastic tissue characteristic of psoriasis. TOXICOLOGY: Corticosteroids decrease calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion, and inhibit osteoblast formation, leading to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute toxicity following overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Acute ingestion is rarely a clinical problem. Acute adrenal insufficiency rarely reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial fibrillation)(methylPREDNISolone), seizures (methylPREDNISolone), anaphylaxis. CHRONIC EXPOSURE:  Cushingoid appearance, muscle wasting and weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia, subcapsulary cataracts and glaucoma, osteoporosis, psychosis. ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL:  Dysphoria, irritability, emotional liability, depression, fatigue,  anxiety, depersonalization, myalgia, and arthralgia.<br\/><\/li><li><b>HYDROQUINONE-QUINONE <\/b><br\/>USES: MEDICINAL: Hydroquinone is used in topical skin lightening preparations. Topical hydroquinone is also available in combination with fluocinolone acetonide and tretinoin to treat moderate to severe melasma of the face. INDUSTRIAL: Hydroquinone and quinone are used as photographic reducers and developers, antioxidants, stabilizer in paints, oils, and motor fuels, an antioxidant in fats and oils, and as a chemical intermediate and reagent. PHARMACOLOGY: Hydroquinone is a strong reducing agent and is easily oxidized to form quinone. Hydroquinone inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) alanine (dopa) and suppresses metabolic processes of melanocytes, thus producing depigmentation of the skin which is reversible. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: ORAL EXPOSURE: Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, delirium, tinnitus, green or brownish urine, elevated liver enzymes, muscle twitching, and dyspnea. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Skin irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, and hypomelanosis of the skin. OCULAR EXPOSURE: Eye irritation, corneal ulceration, and keratitis. SEVERE TOXICITY: ORAL EXPOSURE: Seizures, metabolic acidosis, cyanosis, methemoglobinemia, albuminuria, hematuria, liver damage, marked cachexia, respiratory failure, coma, and cardiovascular collapse. ADVERSE EFFECTS: DERMAL: Localized contact dermatitis, pruritus, dry skin, burning, desquamation, erythema, brown or orange-brown nail discoloration, paradoxical ochronosis-like hyperpigmentation of the skin, and hypersensitivity reactions.<br\/><\/li><li><b>TRETINOIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Tretinoin (All-trans-retinoic acid) and related compounds are forms of vitamin A. Tretinoin topical formulation is used for the treatment of acne vulgaris, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin. Tretinoin oral capsule is used to induce the remission of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Acitretin is used orally for the treatment of severe refractory psoriasis in adults. Refer to &quot;ISOTRETINOIN&quot; management for specific information about isotretinoin. PHARMACOLOGY: The mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated. Tretinoins can affect nuclear transcription in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and protein synthesis. Tretinoin induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells. For acne, it may decrease cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells and decreased microcomedo formation. TOXICOLOGY: In overdose, it can affect multiple organ systems and can be similar to symptoms of hypervitaminosis A. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon and most cases develop only minor symptoms. Severe toxicity is very rare and deaths have not been reported. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and general malaise may occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity includes hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure, renal insufficiency and acute renal failure, hypotension, and acute lung injury. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Common adverse effects with therapeutic dosing include chest discomfort, edema, rash, skin irritation, weight gain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, increased liver enzymes, bone pain, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, fever, and malaise. Pseudotumor cerebri, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia and pancreatitis have been reported. The retinoic acid syndrome can occur after oral administration of tretinoin. Manifestations can include fever, dyspnea, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusion, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension. Topical application causes drying of skin. Tretinoin is a human teratogen.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926952-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

HOSPITAL: Although not as irritating as phenol, dilution with water or milk is indicated with hydroquinone-quinone ingestions. This may prevent damage due to the irritant nature of these compounds. Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. OCULAR: Immediately flush eye with water for at least 15 minutes.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory symptoms, upper airway injury, CNS depression or persistent seizures.<\/li><li>Methemoglobinemia: Initiate oxygen therapy. Treat with methylene blue if patient is symptomatic (usually at methemoglobin concentrations greater than 20% to 30% or at lower concentrations in patients with anemia, underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease). For adults or children, administer 1 to 2 mg\/kg (0.3 to 1 mg\/kg for neonates) IV over 5 minutes with 30 mL flush of normal saline as needed every 4 hours. Improvement should be noted shortly after administration if diagnosis is correct.

Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting. Monitor vital signs and mental status in symptomatic patients. Monitor CBC, renal function, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Obtain methemoglobin concentrations in all cyanotic patients and patients demonstrating dyspnea or other signs of hypoxia. Monitor pulse oximetry or arterial blood gases, and obtain a chest x-ray in any patient with respiratory symptoms.  Hydroquinone is not found naturally in the body.

Decontamination with soap and water for topical exposures. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Administer antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. If respiratory failure develops, intubation and mechanical ventilation will be required. Hemodialysis may be needed if renal insufficiency and renal failure develop. Dexamethasone (10 mg IV every 12 hours for 3 or more days) may be helpful in patients with retinoic acid syndrome. Benzodiazepines can be used for hypertensive and agitated patients. For severe hypertension, sodium nitroprusside can be used, with nitroglycerin and phentolamine as possible alternatives. Sinus tachycardia does not generally require treatment unless hemodynamic compromise develops.  If therapy is required, a short acting, cardioselective agent such as esmolol is generally preferred.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if large or polypharmacy overdose has occurred.
