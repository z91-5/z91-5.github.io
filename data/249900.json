Although gemfibrozil may slightly reduce total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, use of gemfibrozil in patients with elevated triglycerides associated with type IV hyperlipidemia often results in significant increases in LDL; LDL concentrations are not significantly affected by gemfibrozil in patients with Type IIb hyperlipidemia (although HDL is significantly increased) . The mechanism of this action is not completely understood but may involve inhibition of peripheral lipolysis; reduced hepatic extraction of free fatty acids, which reduces hepatic triglyceride production ; inhibition of synthesis and increased clearance of VLDL carrier, apolipoprotein B, which also reduces VLDL production ; and, according to animal studies, reduced incorporation of long-chain fatty acids into newly formed triglycerides, accelerated turnover and removal of cholesterol from the liver (stimulates incorporation of cholesterol precursors into liver sterols), and increased excretion of cholesterol in the feces.  <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"249900-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"249900-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Well absorbed <br\/>"},"2":{"id":"249900-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"249900-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: 6%; Renal 70%, largely unchanged <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"249900-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 1.3 h <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"249900-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>take 30 min before morning and evening meals <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"249900-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>lipid panel<\/li><li>CBC; periodically during first 12 months of therapy<\/li><li>liver function<\/li><li>serum creatine kinase in patients experiencing muscle pain and in those receiving other drugs associated with myopathy<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"249900-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 600 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Lopid<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 600 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"249900-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"249900-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>GEMFIBROZIL <\/b><br\/>USES: Gemfibrozil, a lipid regulating agent, is used as an adjunct therapy to lower severely elevated serum triglycerides (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol while increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL). PHARMACOLOGY: The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Gemfibrozil is chemically and pharmacologically similar to clofibrate. It appears to inhibit peripheral lipolysis and to decrease the hepatic extraction of free fatty acids, thereby reducing hepatic triglyceride production. It also inhibits synthesis and increases clearance of VLDL carrier apolipoprotein B that leads to a decrease in VLDL production. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon. OVERDOSE: Limited data. It is anticipated that adverse events may be an extension of clinical events reported with therapy. A child developed abdominal cramps, abnormal liver enzymes, diarrhea, increased CPK, joint and muscle pain, nausea and vomiting after ingesting up to 9 g of gemfibrozil. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Gastrointestinal irritation (ie, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), joint and muscle pain, increased CPK and abnormal liver enzymes have occurred in a limited number of cases. SEVERE TOXICITY: Liver injury and rhabdomyolysis may develop. Renal failure may occur secondary to rhabdomyolysis. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Gastrointestinal irritation, headache, and myopathy are acute adverse effects.  Renal failure may occur secondary to rhabdomyolysis.<br\/>"},{"id":"249900-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>GEMFIBROZIL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor fluid status in patients with significant gastrointestinal loss; treat significant symptoms with IV fluids and antiemetics. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive; limited overdose data. Monitor liver enzymes.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: In general, gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary.  HOSPITAL: In general, GI decontamination is not necessary. Consider activated charcoal after a very large overdose or if a more toxic coingestant is involved, and the patient is alert and able to maintain their airway or if the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support or management is unlikely to be necessary following a gemfibrozil exposure.<\/li><li>Fluid\/electrolyte balance regulation: Provide suitable replacement should gastrointestinal irritation result in excessive fluid and electrolyte loss due to vomiting and diarrhea.<\/li><li>Rhabdomyolysis: Early aggressive fluid replacement to help prevent renal insufficiency. Diuretics may be needed to maintain urine output. Urinary alkalinization is NOT routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor liver enzymes, CK and renal function tests in cases of myopathy. Monitor fluid and electrolyte status.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial because gemfibrozil is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child with an inadvertent exposure (a single dose) can be managed at home with adult supervision. An adult with an inadvertent exposure of an extra dose can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted.
