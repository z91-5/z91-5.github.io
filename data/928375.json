It is also used as a second-line therapy in the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. It has also been used in the treatment of the following: bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancers, melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, testicular cancer, thymomas, uterine cancers, and cancers of unknown primary site. Typically, it is administered intravenously, but it has also been administered via the intraperitoneal route for the treatment of ovarian cancer. PHARMACOLOGY: Paclitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor; it binds to tubulin and promotes its assembly into microtubules while inhibiting disassembly. The stabilization that occurs produces inhibition of mitotic and interphase cellular functions. TOXICOLOGY: Paclitaxel inhibits normal interphase and mitotic cellular function, causing cell death. Overdose effects are seen primarily in rapidly dividing cells (ie, bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Inadvertent overdose or exposure is uncommon. OVERDOSE: Data are limited. Overdose effects are expected to be an extension of adverse events and include bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity, and mucositis. Events may take several days up to a week or more to develop. Since paclitaxel is often combined with other chemotherapeutic agents, certain toxicities may be more severe (ie, hematologic, gastrointestinal) depending on the agent(s) used. Acute ethanol toxicity (for ethanol-containing formulation) may develop, primarily in children. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY:  Early symptoms (within hours to days) may include nausea\/vomiting and diarrhea. CNS function may be altered by ethanol toxicity. Other common events may include mucositis, myalgias\/arthralgias, and peripheral neurotoxicity (usually sensory). SEVERE TOXICITY: Myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia) is likely to develop and may be severe (grade 3 or higher). Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia may also develop. Myelotoxicity may be exacerbated by patients with abnormal liver function (total bilirubin of greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal). ADVERSE EFFECTS: Bone marrow suppression is the major dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel therapy. In a summary of adverse effects in patients with solid tumors treated with single-agent paclitaxel, moderate neutropenia (less than 2000\/mm(3)) occurred in 90% of cases with severe neutropenia (less than 500\/mm(3)) reported in 52% of cases. Leukopenia (less than 4000\/mm(3); 90%), anemia (less than 11 g\/dL; 78%), and thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000\/mm(3); 20%) were observed following single-agent paclitaxel, but symptoms were not severe (less than grade 3) in most cases. In addition, peripheral neuropathy (60%), myalgias\/arthralgias (60%), nausea\/vomiting (38%), diarrhea (31%), and mucositis (87%) were also common events observed with single-agent paclitaxel. In an adjuvant breast carcinoma study, patients receiving combination therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, experienced more episodes of grade 3\/4 neurosensory toxicity, myalgia\/arthralgia, neurologic pain (5% vs 1%) and flu-like symptoms (5% vs 3%), and hyperglycemia (3% vs 1%). Hypersensitivity reactions (41%) are more frequently observed with the Cremophor EL formulation even with premedication; fatalities have occurred in a small number of cases. Injection site reactions usually produce mild symptoms. Other frequent events: fever, edema, asthenia, malaise and edema. PEDIATRIC:  Based on limited studies, children receiving paclitaxel were more likely to develop neurotoxic effects (ie, somnolence, mild agitation, coma) shortly after exposure; neutropenia was not found to be the dose-limiting toxicity. INFREQUENT: Cardiovascular events (bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, ECG abnormalities), liver injury, infections, anorexia, and confusion are not commonly observed with single-agent therapy. Severe injection site reactions (ie, phlebitis, cellulitis, and necrosis) are more often seen with longer infusions. INTRAPERITONEAL: Systemic toxicity occurs similar to that seen with intravenous therapy, along with occasional port complications including infection, inflow obstruction or blockage, abdominal pain, and bowel injury. DERMAL: Tingling, redness or burning of the skin. INHALATION: May produce dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat, and nausea.<br\/>"},{"id":"928375-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PACLITAXEL<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive, there is no antidote. Early signs of toxicity may include nausea\/vomiting and diarrhea, that can be severe. It may be necessary to treat with multiple concomitant agents, from different drug classes, in patients with persistent symptoms. BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION: Neutropenia should be anticipated. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure. Place patients with severe neutropenia in protective isolation. PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Likely to develop in overdose. Monitor and treat symptoms. Effects are usually reversible, but may persist for long periods. MYALGIAS: Initially treat with acetaminophen (NSAIDs if the patient is not thrombocytopenic). Glutamine and gabapentin have been used with some success to treat persistent symptoms. PEDIATRIC: Based on limited data, children may be more likely to develop neurotoxicity (ie, somnolence, agitation, seizures, coma) following exposure. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: NEUTROPENIA: Bone marrow suppression (ie, neutropenia) may be severe. Neutropenia is the dose-dependent and the dose-limiting toxicity in therapy. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be initiated as soon as possible. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Platelet and red cell transfusions may be necessary. EMESIS: Aggressively treat with antiemetics and fluid and electrolyte replacement as indicated. Closely monitor patients for hypotension, bradycardia and other cardiac dysrhythmias. Monitor liver enzymes and renal function. PEDIATRIC: Based on limited data, children may be more likely to develop neurotoxicity (ie, somnolence, agitation, seizures, coma) following exposure.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not indicated since overdose is unlikely because paclitaxel is administered by the intravenous route. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal and\/or gastric lavage are generally not indicated, ingestion is unlikely.<\/li><li>Airway management: Consider orotracheal intubation in patients with significant CNS depression or respiratory failure.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote for paclitaxel.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Severe neutropenia should be anticipated following a significant exposure. Place patients in protective isolation. Give colony stimulating factor as soon as possible. Closely monitor CBC with differential daily until patient recovery. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ (preferred route). Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hour OR 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day SubQ once daily.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Vomiting: Treat nausea and vomiting with high-dose dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, promethazine or prochlorperazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, ondansetron, dolasetron, or granisetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and\/or antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol). Diphenhydramine may be required to prevent dystonic reactions from dopamine antagonists, phenothiazines, or antipsychotics. Replace fluid and electrolytes as needed. Monitor liver and renal function closely.<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Ice chips (ie, cryotherapy) may help minimize symptoms. Palifermin, a keratinocyte growth factor, is indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Treat mild symptoms of pain or xerostomia with bland rinses (ie, normal saline or sodium bicarbonate). Treat salivary gland dysfunction or xerostomia with sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, bethanechol, topical fluorides or remineralizing agents. Treat moderate pain symptoms with topical anesthetics (ie, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin) and mucosal coating agents (benzydamine) as needed. Moderate to severe symptoms may require systemic analgesics. Prophylactic treatment to prevent infection is suggested; topical or systemic treatment may be indicated. It may affect the entire gastrointestinal tract and lead to significant morbidity and mortality in some cases. Lower GI symptoms can include: diarrhea, abdominal pain, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and in rare cases, neutropenic enterocolitis. These events may occur several days after exposure. Treatment should include fluid and nutritional replacement and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with severe paclitaxel overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Peripheral axonal neuropathy: Peripheral neurotoxicity should be anticipated in overdose. Paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity can produce distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (sensory greater than motor). Monitor and treat symptoms as indicated. Pain is sometimes present. Amitriptyline may be used for neuropathic symptoms. In general, symptoms are reversible, but may persist for long periods.<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Paclitaxel is both an irritant and vesicant. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Administer hyaluronidase (see dosing below). Elevate the affected area. Apply cold compresses on the area for 15 to 20 minutes each hour for 4 hours or at least 4 times daily. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable).  Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy.  HYALURONIDASE: Local injection of hyaluronidase (150 to 300 Units diluted in 3 mL of saline subQ or intradermally) has been suggested by some authors to treat paclitaxel-induced extravasations. Impaired healing has been suggested with the use of hyaluronidase.  Another source recommended hyaluronidase 1500 Units in 2 mL water for injection using the pin cushion technique; however, routine use is probably not warranted.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free normal saline or Lactated Ringer's). For large overdoses, consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free NS or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP\/L NS or LR) may also be useful for perfusion because of paclitaxel's high protein binding. Give dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Paclitaxel is highly protein-bound with a large volume of distribution, but after large doses the distribution is saturable so the drug stays in the central compartment longer. Theoretically, plasmapheresis or plasma exchange might effectively remove significant quantities of paclitaxel, if performed soon after a large overdose. There are no reports of the use of plasmapheresis to treat paclitaxel overdose.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain CBC with differential daily to evaluate for bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia). Neutrophil nadirs usually occur at a median of 11 days. Serial counts should be monitored until patient recovery. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Closely monitor liver enzymes, bilirubin, renal function, fluid status and electrolytes. Ensure adequate hydration and correct electrolyte abnormalities as needed. Serum lipids and creatine phosphokinase should be monitored periodically. Monitor vital signs, including temperature. Monitor ECG for possible cardiac dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is indicated in patients with evidence of conduction abnormalities. Clinically evaluate patients for the development of mucositis and\/or peripheral neuropathy.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. Patients with a paclitaxel overdose need to be admitted. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved, along with monitoring of serum electrolytes, renal function and hepatic enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT) and bilirubin. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with a paclitaxel overdose. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist with experience treating immunosuppressed and myelosuppressive patients may also be beneficial. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with severe overdose or profound neutropenia may benefit from a transfer to a bone marrow transplant or cancer treatment center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928375-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PACLITAXEL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: No minimum lethal dose has been established.
