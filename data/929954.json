Recipients without immunity to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are at a particularly increased risk; therefore, use in EBV-seropositive patients only. Do not use belatacept in transplant recipients who are EBV seronegative or with unknown EBV serostatus. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of kidney transplant patients should prescribe belatacept. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of malignancies may result from immunosuppression. Use in liver transplant patients is not recommended due to an increased risk of graft loss and death.<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"929954-s-3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"929954-s-3-9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"Epstein-Barr virus seronegative or unknown status; increased risk for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, particularly involving the CNS <br\/>"},{"id":"929954-s-3-10","title":"Precautions","mono":"<ul><li>posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, particularly involving the CNS, has been reported; do not exceed recommended doses of belatacept or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy<\/li><li>infection, bacterial (eg, TB), viral (eg, cytomegalovirus, herpes), fungal, protozoal, or opportunistic, potentially serious or fatal, may occur; posttransplant prophylaxis therapy recommended for cytomegalovirus and Pneumocystis jiroveci<\/li><li>malignancies, including skin; increased risk; limit sunlight or UV light exposure, including tanning beds and sunlamps; use of sunscreen recommended<\/li><li>concomitant use with live vaccines should be avoided<\/li><li>corticosteroid minimization to 5 mg\/day between day 3 and week 6 posttransplant has resulted in an increased rate and grade of acute rejection, especially grade 3 rejection and graft loss in patients with 4 to 6 human leukocyte antigen mismatches; dose adjust corticosteroids to be consistent with clinical trials<\/li><li>cytomegalovirus infection; increased risk for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder<\/li><li>exceeding recommended dose and frequency not recommended; increased risk of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, other malignancies, and serious infections<\/li><li>liver transplant; use not recommended<\/li><li>neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs\/symptoms, new or worsening; potentially indicative of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>polyoma virus nephropathy, most due to BK virus infection, has been reported; consider immunosuppression reduction if develops<\/li><li>progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), JC virus-associated, has been reported; do not exceed recommended doses of belatacept or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy; consider reduction or withdrawal if PML is suspected or diagnosed<\/li><li>T-cell depleting therapy; increased risk for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder<\/li><li>TB has been reported; testing for latent infection prior to treatment recommended<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929954-s-3-11","title":"Pregnancy Category","mono":"C (FDA)<br\/>"},{"id":"929954-s-3-12","title":"Breast Feeding","mono":"Micromedex: Infant risk cannot be ruled out.<br\/>"}]},"5":{"id":"929954-s-5","title":"Adverse Effects","mono":"<b>Common<\/b><ul><li><b>Cardiovascular:<\/b>Hypertension (32%), Peripheral edema (34%)<\/li><li><b>Endocrine metabolic:<\/b>Hyperkalemia (20%), Hypokalemia (21%)<\/li><li><b>Gastrointestinal:<\/b>Constipation (33%), Diarrhea (39%), Nausea (24%), Vomiting (22%)<\/li><li><b>Hematologic:<\/b>Anemia (45%), Leukopenia (20%)<\/li><li><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Infectious disease (72% to 82%)<\/li><li><b>Neurologic:<\/b>Headache (21%)<\/li><li><b>Renal:<\/b>Urinary tract infectious disease (37%)<\/li><li><b>Respiratory:<\/b>Cough (24%)<\/li><li><b>Other:<\/b>Fever (28%)<\/li><\/ul><b>Serious<\/b><ul><li><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Cytomegalovirus infection (11% to 13%), Disease due to Polyomavirus (3% to 4%), Infectious disease (Severe) (24% to 36%), Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder<\/li><li><b>Neurologic:<\/b>Guillain-Barr  syndrome (less than 10%), Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy<\/li><li><b>Renal:<\/b>Disorder of transplanted kidney (25%)<\/li><\/ul>"},"6":{"id":"929954-s-6","title":"Drug Name Info","sub":{"0":{"id":"929954-s-6-17","title":"US Trade Names","mono":"Nulojix<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"929954-s-6-19","title":"Class","mono":"Immunological Agent<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"929954-s-6-20","title":"Regulatory Status","mono":"RX<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"929954-s-6-21","title":"Generic Availability","mono":"No<br\/>"}}},"7":{"id":"929954-s-7","title":"Mechanism Of Action","mono":"Belatacept, a selective T cell costimulation blocker, is a fusion protein containing modified CTLA-4 linked to a portion of the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin GI antibody.
