Atropine and pralidoxime auto-injector is used by emergency medical services personnel to treat nerve agent or insecticide intoxication. Refer to \"Anticholinergic poisoning\", \"Organophosphates\", or \"Military nerve agents\" documents for more information regarding the use of pralidoxime in combination with atropine. Pralidoxime cannot be used to treat poisoning due to phosphorus, inorganic phosphates or organophosphates that do not have anticholinesterase activity. PHARMACOLOGY: Pralidoxime chloride reactivates cholinesterase (mainly outside CNS) which was inactivated by organophosphate pesticides through phosphorylation. By means of direct chemical reaction, it slows down the process of \"aging\" of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a permanently inactive form. Pralidoxime also detoxifies certain organophosphates. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Data are limited. Overdose effects observed in healthy volunteers include dizziness, blurred vision, diplopia, headache, impaired accommodation, nausea, and slight tachycardia. ADVERSE EFFECTS: It is difficult to differentiate side effects of pralidoxime from effects of the poison or atropine. Blurred vision, diplopia and impaired accommodation, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, nausea, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperventilation, muscular weakness, and elevations in liver enzymes and creatine phosphokinase were observed in healthy volunteers. <br\/>"},{"id":"477250-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PRALIDOXIME<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: It is difficult to differentiate side effects of pralidoxime from effects of the poison or atropine. Refer to &quot;Anticholinergic poisoning&quot;, &quot;Organophosphates&quot;, or &quot;Military nerve agents&quot; documents for more information regarding the use of pralidoxime in combination with atropine. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory distress.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, liver enzymes, and CK levels in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management, and pralidoxime is generally only used in the hospital setting.  OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted.
