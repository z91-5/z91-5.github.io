ROPINIRole is also used for the treatment of restless leg syndrome.  Apomorphine is administered subcutaneously, rOPINIRole orally, and rotigotine as a transdermal patch. For information on pramipexole, refer to PRAMIPEXOLE and RELATED AGENTS. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents act by stimulating dopamine D2-type receptors within the caudate-putamen in the brain. Apomorphine has high affinity for dopamine-4 (D4) receptors and moderate affinity for the dopamine-2, dopamine-3 and dopamine-5 receptors. ROPINIRole and rotigotine are selective for the dopamine-2 (D2)-receptor agonist with higher specificity for D3 receptors. TOXICOLOGY: Overdose effects are related to peripheral and central dopaminergic stimulation. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare; however, apomorphine abuse has been reported in other countries. Patients may overdose on apomorphine to avoid &quot;off&quot; episodes or to experience an increase in psychosexual stimulation. Male patients with Parkinson disease have been reported to increase the frequency of their injections leading to heightened libido, stimulation of penile erections, hallucinations, dyskinesia, abnormal behavior, agitation, confusion, and depression. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Headache, nasal congestion, dryness of mouth, nausea, vomiting, flushing, coughing, fatigue. ROPINIROLE: Of patients receiving inadvertent doses greater than 24 mg\/day, one experienced mild orofacial dyskinesia, and another had transient nausea. Other effects reported after unintentional overdose (a dose greater than 24 mg\/day) included visual hallucinations, hyperhidrosis, claustrophobia, chorea, palpitations, asthenia, and nightmares. Doses of 24 mg or less or overdoses of unknown amounts have been associated with the following effects: vomiting, increased coughing, fatigue, syncope, dyskinesia, agitation, chest pain, orthostatic hypotension, somnolence, and confusion. ROTIGOTINE: There have been no reports of overdose; however, in the event of an overdose, the following primary symptoms may be expected: nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, confusion, seizures, and other signs of excessive dopaminergic stimulation. SEVERE POISONING: Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, supraventricular ectopy, chest pain, lethargy, dizziness, euphoria, dyskinesias, agitation, confusion, mydriasis, drowsiness, sedation, vomiting, nausea, visual hallucinations, hyperhidrosis, claustrophobia, chorea, palpitations, asthenia, nightmares, syncope, somnolence, involuntary movements, seizures, ataxia,  and other signs of excessive dopaminergic stimulation. APOMORPHINE: Loss of consciousness, bradycardia, and hypotension were reported in a patient who received 25 mg of apomorphine. ADVERSE EFFECTS: THERAPEUTIC: ROPINIROLE: Spontaneous vomiting and mild hypotension, sweating, nausea, dizziness, and impotence have been reported as adverse effects in clinical trials. The majority of adverse effects are related to the peripheral dopaminergic activity of rOPINIRole. ROTIGOTINE: Nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, headache, and application site reactions are the most frequently reported adverse effects reported with rotigotine therapy. For information on pramipexole, please refer to PRAMIPEXOLE AND RELATED AGENTS management. APOMORPHINE: Yawning, dyskinesia, somnolence, dizziness, rhinorrhea, edema, chest pain, increased sweating, flushing, and pallor have been reported in clinical trials. Severe nausea and vomiting have been reported with therapeutic doses.<br\/><\/li><li><b>PRAMIPEXOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist. It is used to treat the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and Restless Leg Syndrome. PHARMACOLOGY: Pramipexole is a non-ergot derived selective dopamine (D2\/D3) receptor agonist. Therapeutic effect is likely due to increased dopaminergic neuron firing in the substantia nigra and striatum. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive dopamine agonist effects can cause lethargy and hallucinations. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are uncommon and life-threatening toxicity has not been reported with overdose. OVERDOSE: There is little information on overdose in humans.  Tachycardia, vomiting, lethargy, and drowsiness have been reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects have included syncope (possibly due to orthostatic hypotension), somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal effects, nausea and vomiting, sweating, loss of color vision, peripheral edema and pallor. Auditory and visual hallucinations have also been reported.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jt6ys12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>DOPAMINE RECEPTOR AGONISTS (NON-ERGOT) <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat dyskinesias by decreasing the dose and providing supportive care. Treat dystonia with benzodiazepines and antispasmodic agents (benztropine, diphenhydramine). Treat hypotension with IV fluids and treat dysrhythmias with routine antiarrhythmic agents.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain airway or if airway is protected. Due to the mechanism of action of dopamine D2 receptor agonists, spontaneous vomiting is expected to occur following an overdose. Remove rotogotine patch and wash exposed skin.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with excessive drowsiness and the inability to protect their own airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Dystonia: Dystonias may respond to diazepam, diphenhydramine or benztropine. ADULT: Benztropine is dosed at 1 to 4 mg IV or IM, maximum 6 mg\/day. Diphenhydramine is dosed at 25 to 50 mg IV over 2 minutes. PEDIATRIC: Diphenhydramine: 1.25 mg\/kg\/dose IV over 2 minutes.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 mL to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine. Central venous pressure monitoring may be indicated to guide fluid therapy in patients with persistent hypotension. Administer atropine if hypotension is secondary to bradycardia. If hypotension persists administer dopamine (5 to 20 mcg\/kg\/min) or norepinephrine (ADULT: begin infusion at 0.5 to 1 mcg\/min; PEDIATRIC: begin infusion at 0.1 mcg\/kg\/min); titrate to desired response<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Monitor for dysrhythmias and treat with routine antiarrhythmic agents.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: APOMORPHINE ONLY: Use of a 5HT3 antagonist (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron and alosetron) is contraindicated. Use of apomorphine with ondansetron has resulted in profound hypotension and loss of consciousness. In clinical trials, trimethobenzamide was use as the primary therapy for apomorphine induced nausea and\/or vomiting.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient:   Monitor vital signs and ECG in symptomatic patients. Monitor for CNS depression. Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance in patients with prolonged vomiting.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: These agents have large volumes of distribution, methods to enhance elimination would not be effective.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients who are asymptomatic after inadvertent ingestion can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients and those with deliberate ingestions should be sent to a medical facility for evaluation and treatment. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All patients who remain symptomatic after 6 to 12 hours of observation should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist for assistance with medical management if the patient has more than moderate symptoms or symptoms not consistent with the exposure or the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>PRAMIPEXOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Supportive care is sufficient in nearly all patients. Antiemetics should be given if nausea and vomiting occurs. Investigation should be undertaken to assess for possibility of co-ingestants that may complicate the clinical course. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care remains the mainstay of treatment. Patients with co-ingestants causing respiratory depression or loss of airway reflexes should be intubated. Hypotension is not expected but should be treated with IV fluids and pressors if necessary. Patients with severe toxicity have likely ingested other substances.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is not indicated, as severe toxicity is not expected even in large overdoses. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal, orogastric lavage, and whole bowel irrigation are not indicated in pramipexole overdose. Each method carries some risk, and pramipexole overdoses are usually benign. Consider activated charcoal if more toxic agents may be involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary unless co-ingestants that cause respiratory depression are present.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. No routine laboratory studies are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. ECG, serum electrolytes, salicylate, and acetaminophen concentrations should be obtained after deliberate overdose. Lab analysis should be directed towards ruling out more serious ingestions and conditions. Pramipexole concentrations are generally not available and are not clinically useful in guiding therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Enhanced elimination is not indicated due to mild toxicity in overdose and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients who are asymptomatic after inadvertent ingestions may be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or who are symptomatic should be referred to a healthcare facility. Those without significant signs and symptoms can likely be discharged after a 6-hour observation period. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe CNS depression, and\/or co-ingestions of other more toxic symptoms may require admission. In general, patients will be asymptomatic within 24 to 48 hours.
