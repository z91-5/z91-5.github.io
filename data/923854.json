PHARMACOLOGY: A relatively selective alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist. With ophthalmic administration, brimonidine lowers intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. When applied as a topical gel to the facial area, brimonidine may decrease erythema via direct vasoconstriction. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Drowsiness, lethargy, hypotension, bradycardia, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and hypothermia have been reported after intraocular use in infants and ingestion in toddlers. Since ocular dosing is not weight-adjusted, children may experience systemic toxic effects more frequently. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Fatigue, drowsiness, headache, and ocular symptoms (ie, ocular hyperemia, burning, stinging, pruritus, blurring, conjunctival follicles, and foreign body sensation) are the most commonly reported adverse effects, occurring in 10% to 30% of patients following therapeutic administration. Other effects that may occur less frequently include: mild hypotension, miosis, allergic reactions, upper respiratory symptoms (3% to 9%), and dizziness (3% to 9%) and erythema and flushing following topical gel therapy.<br\/>"},{"id":"923854-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BRIMONIDINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids.  Bradycardia is typically mild and usually doesn't require any treatment. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Severe bradycardia associated with hypotension should be treated with atropine.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS or respiratory depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote for brimonidine. Brimonidine-induced respiratory depression, hypotension, and coma may respond to naloxone, although naloxone administration was reportedly ineffective in several case reports of children with brimonidine-induced CNS and respiratory depression. Some patients with clonidine intoxication (another alpha-2 agonist) have responded to naloxone (reversal of altered mental status, respiratory depression or apnea, and miosis) with inconsistent success.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients. Monitor pulse oximetry in patients with decreased respirations. Plasma brimonidine concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be useful following an oral exposure.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients who are asymptomatic after an inadvertent exposure may be managed at home. All children with brimonidine ingestions should be evaluated at a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, or who are symptomatic, should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA:  Patients with worsening symptoms or severe systemic symptoms should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Patients with mental status changes or severe respiratory distress require ICU admission. Patients should remain admitted until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923854-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>BRIMONIDINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Minimum toxic dose has not been established.
