Topical hydroquinone is also available in combination with fluocinolone acetonide and tretinoin to treat moderate to severe melasma of the face. INDUSTRIAL: Hydroquinone and quinone are used as photographic reducers and developers, antioxidants, stabilizer in paints, oils, and motor fuels, an antioxidant in fats and oils, and as a chemical intermediate and reagent. PHARMACOLOGY: Hydroquinone is a strong reducing agent and is easily oxidized to form quinone. Hydroquinone inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) alanine (dopa) and suppresses metabolic processes of melanocytes, thus producing depigmentation of the skin which is reversible. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: ORAL EXPOSURE: Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, delirium, tinnitus, green or brownish urine, elevated liver enzymes, muscle twitching, and dyspnea. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Skin irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, and hypomelanosis of the skin. OCULAR EXPOSURE: Eye irritation, corneal ulceration, and keratitis. SEVERE TOXICITY: ORAL EXPOSURE: Seizures, metabolic acidosis, cyanosis, methemoglobinemia, albuminuria, hematuria, liver damage, marked cachexia, respiratory failure, coma, and cardiovascular collapse. ADVERSE EFFECTS: DERMAL: Localized contact dermatitis, pruritus, dry skin, burning, desquamation, erythema, brown or orange-brown nail discoloration, paradoxical ochronosis-like hyperpigmentation of the skin, and hypersensitivity reactions. <br\/>"},{"id":"292430-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>HYDROQUINONE-QUINONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Although not as irritating as phenol, dilution with water or milk is indicated with hydroquinone-quinone ingestions. This may prevent damage due to the irritant nature of these compounds. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines; add barbiturates or propofol, if seizures persist. Treat symptomatic methemoglobinemia with methylene blue.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Although not as irritating as phenol, dilution with water or milk is indicated with hydroquinone-quinone ingestions. This may prevent damage due to the irritant nature of these compounds. SKIN: Wash with soap and water. OCULAR: Immediately flush eye with water for at least 15 minutes. HOSPITAL: Although not as irritating as phenol, dilution with water or milk is indicated with hydroquinone-quinone ingestions. This may prevent damage due to the irritant nature of these compounds. Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. OCULAR: Immediately flush eye with water for at least 15 minutes.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory symptoms, upper airway injury, CNS depression or persistent seizures.<\/li><li>Methemoglobinemia: Initiate oxygen therapy. Treat with methylene blue if patient is symptomatic (usually at methemoglobin concentrations greater than 20% to 30% or at lower concentrations in patients with anemia, underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease). For adults or children, administer 1 to 2 mg\/kg (0.3 to 1 mg\/kg for neonates) IV over 5 minutes with 30 mL flush of normal saline as needed every 4 hours. Improvement should be noted shortly after administration if diagnosis is correct. Occasionally, additional doses are needed.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting. Monitor vital signs and mental status in symptomatic patients. Monitor CBC, renal function, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Obtain methemoglobin concentrations in all cyanotic patients and patients demonstrating dyspnea or other signs of hypoxia. Monitor pulse oximetry or arterial blood gases, and obtain a chest x-ray in any patient with respiratory symptoms.  Hydroquinone is not found naturally in the body. Green or brown-green colored urine may be found in patients with hydroquinone exposure.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis has not been shown to be of value in the removal of these compounds.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with worsening symptoms or severe systemic symptoms should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"292430-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>HYDROQUINONE-QUINONE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Ingestions of hydroquinone up to 500 mg\/day for 5 months produced no symptoms.
