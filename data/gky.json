PHARMACOLOGY: These agents work by buffering hydrochloric acid in the stomach and increasing gastric pH. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicity can result from excessive bicarbonate absorption causing systemic alkalosis, or from excessive absorption of the cations in the alkaline salts (eg, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, sodium). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common; significant toxicity is rare and generally develops from chronic excessive use rather than acute overdose. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Diarrhea or constipation can develop. Asymptomatic hypermagnesemia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, elevations in serum aluminum concentrations or mild volume overload may also develop after chronic excessive use. SEVERE TOXICITY: With prolonged administration and\/or excessively large doses, dysrhythmias, hypo- and hypertension, encephalopathy, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal obstruction and\/or perforation, metabolic alkalosis, fluid, electrolyte, and mineral derangements, and myopathies and osteodystrophies have been reported. Distention and\/or obstruction with perforation and hypergastrinemia have been observed with prolonged or excessive antacid administration. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Constipation or diarrhea are the most common adverse effects.<br\/><\/li><li><b>SILICONES <\/b><br\/>USES: Silicone is used to make consumer products and medical implants. It is used as a filler in breast implants. It has been injected directly into tissue for cosmetic purposes, although this is not a medically approved use. Simethicone is used to treat colic and gaseous distension. PHARMACOLOGY: Simethicone is though to decrease gaseous distension by decreasing surface tension of gas bubbles in the GI tract. TOXICOLOGY: Silicones are generally not toxic, but injection may result in local granuloma formation. Systemic absorption of a large amount may produce silicone pulmonary embolism. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Environmental exposure is common. Injection for cosmetic purposes is uncommon. Life-threatening effects are very rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Ingestion is not expected to produce significant toxicity. Injection may produce local tissue granuloma formation. SEVERE TOXICITY: Direct injection into tissue can cause a severe systemic reaction with fever, pneumonitis, widespread microemboli and associated tissue infarction (primarily lungs but also intestines, liver, brain and heart), acute lung injury, and alveolar hemorrhage. Fatalities have been reported.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"gkys12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANTACIDS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TOXICITY: No treatment is generally necessary beyond supportive care and cessation of antacid use. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Evaluate for electrolyte abnormalities (hypernatremia, hypermagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia) and volume overload and treat as necessary. Monitor ECG.<\/li><li>Decontamination: GI decontamination is not necessary because of the poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and lack of systemic toxicity after acute overdose.<\/li><li>Hypercalcemia: Treat with intravenous hydration; add diuretics if hypercalcemia persists.<\/li><li>Hypermagnesemia: Treat with intravenous fluids. Monitor ECG and neurologic exam (particularly deep tendon reflexes). Hemodialysis can be used to treat severe hypermagnesemia.<\/li><li>Aluminum intoxication: Generally no treatment is required beyond cessation of exposure. Deferoxamine can be used for severe aluminum intoxication, primarily in patients with renal failure.<\/li><li>Hypernatremia: Treat with intravenous hydration.<\/li><li>Congestive heart failure: Treat with nitrates and diuretics.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis can be used to correct severe hypermagnesemia or hypercalcemia but is rarely necessary.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No routine laboratory studies are needed in patients with acute exposure. In patients with chronic excessive use, monitor vital signs and evaluate for clinical evidence of volume overload.

Monitor serum aluminum concentrations in patients with encephalopathy after chronic use of aluminum containing antacids, particularly patients with renal failure.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with minimal GI symptoms after inadvertent exposure can be managed at home.
