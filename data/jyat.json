control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

SGLT2 is the main transporter for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin results in a glucuretic effect, this enhanced glucose excretion results in improving fasting and postprandial blood glucose. Metformin hydrochloride is biguanide oral hypoglycemic.

It is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise. PHARMACOLOGY:  Dapagliflozin inhibits the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), which is expressed in the proximal renal tubules and is responsible for most renal reabsorption of filtered glucose. Inhibition of SGLT2 decreases reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, thus urinary glucose excretion is increased. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose has not been reported. OVERDOSE: Toxicity following overdose has not been reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects following therapeutic administration, with an incidence rate of at least 5%, include urinary tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and female genital mycotic infections. LESS COMMON: Other adverse effects include hypotension, back pain, pain in extremities, polyuria, dysuria, dyslipidemia, hyperphosphatemia, nausea, and constipation. Ingestion of dapagliflozin alone is not expected to cause severe hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or insulin secretogogues, hypoglycemia may develop. RARE: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous reactions, and angioedema, have been rarely reported.<br\/><\/li><li><b>METFORMIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Oral hypoglycemic agents for type II diabetes mellitus. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents decrease hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and increase peripheral glucose uptake. TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after acute overdose, as they do not stimulate insulin release. Severe lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially fatal side effect mainly in patients with renal insufficiency, hepatic disease, alcoholism, and advanced age. It can be precipitated by iodinated contrast agents. Metformin inhibits both hepatic lactate uptake and conversion of lactate to glucose. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but severe toxicity is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and myalgia. Acute pancreatitis has been reported in one case report. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe lactic acidosis, confusion, mental status depression, hypothermia, hypotension, and renal failure may develop.  Rarely, ventricular dysrhythmias, respiratory insufficiency, and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal pain, anorexia, headache, and rash. SERIOUS EFFECTS: Lactic acidosis (generally only in patients with renal insufficiency or hepatic disease) and megaloblastic anemia. Hypotension, ventricular extrasystoles, and myocardial infarction have been reported with therapeutic doses. DRUG INTERACTION: Use of radiocontrast dyes in patients taking metformin increases the risk of renal failure and acidosis.  Concurrent use of metformin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of renal failure and acidosis.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jyats12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>DAPAGLIFLOZIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

HYPOGLYCEMIA: Ingestion of dapagliflozin alone is not expected to cause severe hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or insulin secretogogues severe hypoglycemia may develop. In patients with dapagliflozin overdose who are also taking insulin or insulin secretogogues, obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. DIET: If the patient is awake and alert, offer carbohydrates. If hypoglycemia persists or becomes severe, treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia. NOT RECOMMENDED: Prophylactic dextrose administration is not recommended in patients who do not become hypoglycemic, as it may make it difficult to distinguish patients who become hypoglycemic and require prolonged hospitalization from those who remain asymptomatic and may be discharged sooner. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPOTENSION: Treat moderate to severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine or norepinephrine as necessary. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Ingestion of dapagliflozin alone is not expected to cause severe hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or insulin secretogogues severe hypoglycemia may develop. In patients with dapagliflozin overdose who are also taking insulin or insulin secretogogues, obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours.

In patients with dapagliflozin overdose who are also taking insulin or insulin secretogogues, obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours.

Adults with a deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Diabetic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of an extra dose who are asymptomatic can be monitored at home. Asymptomatic non-diabetic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of one or two pills can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: There is no information on the onset or duration of hypoglycemia after overdose of these patients; however, due to the prolonged half-life of dapagliflozin patients may need to be monitored for a minimum of 8 to 12 hours if they are also taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop hypoglycemia should be admitted for a minimum of 24 hours for frequent blood glucose monitoring. They should only be discharged when free of symptoms and are able to maintain euglycemia without supplemental dextrose for 8 hours.

Hypoglycemia from coingestion of other hypoglycemic agents should be managed with dextrose administration. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Early intubation and ventilation assistance should be performed if the patient presents with respiratory or mental status depression. Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if patient presents with circulatory collapse. If the patient develops severe anion gap metabolic acidosis or severe lactic acidosis (pH 7.1 or less), intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, then titrate to correct pH to above 7.2) should be given and emergent hemodialysis should be arranged (especially if renal insufficiency exists).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be considered after large ingestions, if the patient has an appropriate level of consciousness, patent airway, and the patient can drink the charcoal.

Monitor renal function and liver enzymes.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis  is effective in improving acid-base status and may improve clinical outcome in patients with severe lactic acidosis, especially in patients with renal insufficiency, however, it does not remove significant amounts of metformin because of its large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children with acute inadvertent ingestions of 1700 mg or less may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Four to 6 hours of observation period is recommended after immediate-release metformin overdose. Peak concentrations of delayed-release formulations are expected to be delayed after overdose. After an overdose, patients should be observed for the development of toxic effects for 2 to 6 hours longer than the Tmax (Tmax: Glucophage XR 7 hours, Glumetza extended-release: 7 to 8 hours. Fortamet extended-release: 6 hours). Patients who remain asymptomatic during this period with no evidence of metabolic acidosis or hypoglycemia can be discharged home.
