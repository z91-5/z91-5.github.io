The F 18 isotope of flutemetamol F 18 produces a positron signal that is detected by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Flutemetamol F 18 crosses the blood brain barrier and subsequent cerebral perfusion decreases the flutemetamol F 18 in the brain, with differential drug retention in cortical areas that contain beta-amyloid aggregates. Difference in signal intensity between brain regions that may specifically retain flutemetamol F 18 and those that do not are the basis of image interpretation.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"930810-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"930810-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Multiple metabolites: active <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"930810-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Bile: 52%<\/li><li>Renal: 37%<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"930810-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>use proper procedures for handling and disposal of radiopharmaceuticals<\/li><li>maintain appropriate shielding during handling and administration<\/li><li>wear waterproof gloves during the handling procedure<\/li><li>do not dilute<\/li><li>administer IV bolus within 40 seconds, follow with IV 5 to 15 mL saline flush<\/li><li>encourage patients to void before and after imaging procedure and frequently for 24 hours after administration<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"930810-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>pregnancy test; prior to administration in women of childbearing potential<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity; following drug administration<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"930810-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Side effects may include flushing, hypertension, headache, dizziness, or nausea.<\/li><li>Tell patient to void as often as possible for 24 hours after the procedure.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
