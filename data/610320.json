Due to its potential for significant, possibly life-threatening, proarrhythmic effects, thioridazine should be reserved for use in the treatment of schizophrenic patients who fail to show an acceptable response to other courses of treatment. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared with placebo. Although the causes of death in clinical trials were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. It is unclear from these studies to what extent the mortality findings may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to patient characteristics.

Structurally, it is piperidine subtype of the phenothiazine class of compounds. It is used to control the positive symptoms of schizophrenia: hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and disorganized thought. PHARMACOLOGY: Thioridazine is a dopamine receptor antagonist (D2 subtype). Therapeutic effect is likely due to decreased dopaminergic neuron firing in the mesolimbic and mesocortical regions of the brain. TOXICOLOGY: Thioridazine has a tricyclic structure, and can block fast sodium channel blockade resulting in dysrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse. A high degree of alpha-1 adrenergic antagonism leads to hypotension secondary to peripheral vasodilation. Overdose and therapeutic use can result in anticholinergic symptoms; dry mucous membranes and tachycardia are most commonly seen. QT prolongation and torsade de pointes can result from binding to the potassium rectifier (1Kr) channels in the heart. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Thioridazine is rarely used today because of its adverse effects on the neurologic and cardiovascular systems. Overdose and therapeutic adverse reactions are now rare, but can be severe and fatalities have been reported. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tachycardia and sedation are the main consequence of overdose. QT prolongation may develop. SEVERE TOXICITY: QRS widening, AV blocks, ventricular dysrhythmias (including torsades de pointes and recurrent ventricular tachycardia), hypotension, coma, pulmonary edema, and rarely renal failure and seizures may develop with severe poisoning. Refractory dysrhythmias and respiratory complications are the most common causes of death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Mild anticholinergic symptoms are expected with therapeutic use, especially dry mouth. Extrapyramidal symptoms are strongly associated with thioridazine. These symptoms result from dopaminergic antagonism in the striatal pathways. EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS: ACUTE DYSTONIA: Usually of the head and neck. Torticollis, grimacing, and tongue protrusion are common; laryngeal dystonia is rare but can be life-threatening. Onset: within a few hours of treatment initiation. AKATHISIA: Uncontrollable restlessness; typically occurs early in treatment. PARKINSONISM: Due to antagonism of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathways. TARDIVE DYSKINESIA: may be present. Chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tics, and blepharospasms may also be present. NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME: It can develop due to abrupt reductions in striatal and hypothalamic dopamine transmission. More likely to develop with therapeutic use, not overdose. Signs and symptoms develop over a period of several days, usually within 2 weeks of starting treatment. Symptoms can be highly variable (wax and wane) over the course of the patient's illness. <br\/>"},{"id":"610320-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>THIORIDAZINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Acute dystonic reactions and akathisia should initially be treated with cessation of thioridazine. Antihistamines, especially benztropine, can be used to treat symptoms. Benztropine 2 mg IV or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV are generally sufficient. Parkinson symptoms can be treated with anticholinergic therapy or a dopamine agonist like levodopa\/carbidopa and drug withdrawal. Mild acute overdoses can be managed with supportive care including telemetry monitoring for QRS prolongation and QT prolongation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: ACUTE OVERDOSE: Impaired consciousness can lead to loss of airway reflexes requiring intubation. Dramatic anticholinergic toxicity can occur requiring sedation with benzodiazepines. Hypotension secondary to alpha adrenergic blockade usually responds well to IV fluids, add vasopressors, if hypotension persists. QRS prolongation should be treated with boluses of sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg). QT prolongation should be treated with electrolyte repletion. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium, add overdrive pacing if torsades de pointes persists. Seizures should be treated with standard doses of benzodiazepines, add propofol or barbiturates if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is not indicated. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be considered shortly after overdose in patients who can protect their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients with mild CNS depression and normal respirations and airway reflexes should not be intubated prophylactically. Patients with more severe CNS depression or hemodynamic instability should be intubated. Patient's with NMS should be intubated as chest wall rigidity and severely altered mental status can occur.<\/li><li>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: NMS is the most severe manifestation of toxicity and may occur with therapeutic dosing. Supportive care is the most important element of treatment. Airway protection and volume resuscitation are usually necessary. Hyperthermia is multifactorial and will not respond to antipyretics. Submersion in an ice bath is the most rapidly efficient technique. Active cooling blankets, ice packs in the groin and axillae, and evaporative cooling with mist and fans may be more practical. Hypovolemia must be avoided to help prevent rhabdomyolysis-induced renal failure. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for NMS. Dantrolene and bromocriptine are of questionable benefit, but should be considered in severe cases where incremental benefit outweighs potential harm.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Correct electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia). Administer magnesium 1 to 2 g IV, may repeat a second 2 g dose and begin an infusion of 0.5 to 1 g (4 to 8 mEq) per hour for recurrent or persistent dysrhythmias. Institute overdrive pacing if torsades de pointes persists.<\/li><li>Antidote: No specific antidote exists, but benztropine should be used for acute extrapyramidal reactions. Levodopa\/carbidopa and bromocriptine may improve parkinsonian symptoms. Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate should be administered for ventricular dysrhythmias.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function and creatine phosphokinase levels should be monitored until all symptoms resolve.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Enhanced elimination is not indicated due to its large volume of distribution and high protein binding.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Thioridazine has a narrow therapeutic index and toxicity has been reported at just above therapeutic doses (900 mg). Asymptomatic, otherwise healthy adults who inadvertently ingest a dose of less than 800 mg may be observed at home. Older adults or adults with significant co-morbidities should be referred for evaluation if the ingestion is more than 300 mg. Children who ingest less than 0.5 mg\/kg may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: The following patients should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment: symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions, adults who are elderly or with underlying health problems who ingest more than 300 mg; healthy adults who ingest 800 mg or more, and children who ingest 0.5 mg\/kg or more. Patients without significant signs and symptoms can likely be discharged after a 6 hour observation period. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe CNS depression, and\/or coingestion of other more toxic symptoms may require admission. Patients with QRS\/QT prolongation, neuromuscular symptoms or hyperthermia warrant ICU admission.
