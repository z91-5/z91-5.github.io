PHARMACOLOGY: Fosphenytoin is an anticonvulsant that is metabolized to phenytoin and regulates voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels and enhances sodium-potassium ATPase activity. The modulation of voltage-dependent sodium channels is the primary means of anticonvulsant activity. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicity is an extension of therapeutic effects. Patients may develop CNS depression, ataxia, nausea, vomiting and eventually coma and respiratory depression. Cardiac effects are much less common with IV infusion than with phenytoin because propylene glycol is not used as a diluent for fosphenytoin. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is uncommon and rarely severe. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, lethargy, nystagmus, ataxia, dysarthria, hyperreflexia, and mild sedation. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, dysrhythmias, asystole, CNS depression, mental status changes, hallucinations, hypocalcemia, coma, metabolic acidosis, and cardiac arrest may occur. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common side effects of fosphenytoin administration are pruritus, hypotension, dysrhythmias, nystagmus, dizziness, somnolence, lightheadedness, ataxia, paresthesias, headache, tremor, agitation, hypesthesia, dysarthria, vertigo, hyperreflexia, intracranial hypertension, and altered mental status. OTHER EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, injection site pain and inflammation, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, pelvic pain, asthenia, and back pain. <br\/>"},{"id":"923833-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FOSPHENYTOIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The vast majority of fosphenytoin overdoses require only supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat patients who develop respiratory depression, bradycardia, and asystole per ACLS guidelines. Hypotension and tachycardia should be treated with crystalloid infusions. Hypotension and tachycardia are usually the result of accelerated infusions; however, anaphylactoid reactions should remain on your differential. CNS effects are usually self-limiting and will usually resolve with careful observation. Note that some symptoms may persist for 7 to 10 days.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Fosphenytoin is administered parenterally; gastrointestinal decontamination is not useful. HOSPITAL: Fosphenytoin is administered parenterally; gastrointestinal decontamination is not useful.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (CNS or respiratory depression).<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Administer IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids.<\/li><li>Acidosis: Metabolic acidosis has been reported following fosphenytoin overdose. Treat severe metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.1) with sodium bicarbonate 1 to 2 mEq\/kg.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Multidose activated charcoal has been shown to have limited benefit and is not recommended by ACCT or EAPCCT. Hemodialysis may be considered following a significant exposure. Fosphenytoin is highly protein bound which substantially limits clearance with hemodialysis; however, at high concentrations, an increasing fraction of the drug is unbound and amenable to hemodialysis. Hemoperfusion may be more effective. The decision to perform hemodialysis or hemoperfusion should be weighed carefully against the risks of the procedure as there are no studies that demonstrate any clinical benefit and toxic effects are usually not severe.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, pulse oximetry, and mental status. Monitor serial phenytoin concentrations (fosphenytoin is metabolized to phenytoin). Toxic effects are rare at plasma phenytoin concentrations less than 20 mcg\/mL (80 mcmol\/L), but are common in patients with plasma concentrations greater than 30 mcg\/mL (120 mcmol\/L). They should be checked 2 hours after IV infusion and 4 hours after IM administration. Monitor serum electrolytes, kidney function, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with moderate to severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: None. Fosphenytoin is administered parenterally in the hospital setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with inadvertent dosing errors should be observed for dysrhythmias and hypotension for 6 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with ataxia, cardiac dysrhythmias, or hypotension should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (dysrhythmias, hypotension, CNS depression), or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923833-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>FOSPHENYTOIN <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Acute exposures greater than 20 mg\/kg PE or serum concentration greater than 20 mcg\/mL may cause toxicity. Massive overdoses of fosphenytoin (on the order of 10 times the therapeutic dose), associated with serious adverse events, including death, have resulted from misinterpretation of vial labeling of fosphenytoin. An adult developed coma after receiving 10 times the prescribed fosphenytoin (prescribed dose: 375 mg) for postoperative prophylaxis of seizures. She recovered following supportive care. Lateral gaze nystagmus generally appears at phenytoin concentrations greater than 20 mcg\/mL (80 mcmol\/L), ataxia at concentrations 30 mcg\/mL (120 mcmol\/L), and dysarthria and lethargy at concentrations greater than 40 mcg\/mL (160 mcmol\/L). THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULTS: The recommended loading dose of fosphenytoin is 15 to 20 mg of phenytoin equivalents (PE) per kg given IV at a rate of 100 to 150 mg PE\/minute. MAXIMUM IV rate: 150 mg PE\/min.
