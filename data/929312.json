Off-label indications include ADHD and bipolar disorder. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Unintentional and deliberate poisonings are relatively common and may occasionally be severe. Fatalities are rare. PHARMACOLOGY: Selective neuronal reuptake inhibitor of dopamine &gt; norepinephrine &gt;&gt; serotonin. TOXICOLOGY: Primarily sympathomimetic activity. Also possesses peripheral alpha(1)-adrenergic agonism. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tachycardia and mild hypertension are common. Seizures are also fairly common, but usually are self-limited, single seizures. Neurologic disturbances such as agitation, dizziness, tremor, paresthesias, slurred speech, lethargy, confusion, and hallucinations (auditory, visual, or tactile) are fairly common, and often precede the development of seizures. Vomiting develops in a minority of patients. SEVERE TOXICITY: buPROPion may cause recurrent seizures or status epilepticus, hyperthermia, hypotension, and coma. Rarely QRS widening. QTc prolongation (conduction delays), and ventricular dysrhythmias may develop, especially with very large (greater than 9 g) ingestions. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dry mouth, headache, insomnia, nausea, and weight loss. Other symptoms that may occur in 5% to 10% of individuals: abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, tinnitus, memory deficits, paresthesiae, agitation, anxiety, seizures, infection, pharyngitis, palpitation, and sweating. <br\/>"},{"id":"929312-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BUPROPION <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most bupropion overdoses require only supportive care. Treat agitation, tremors, or seizures with benzodiazepines. Hypertension and tachycardia are generally mild and well tolerated, and do not require specific treatment. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat seizures with benzodiazepines; recurrent seizures may require the addition of barbiturates or propofol. Treat hypotension with fluids and pressors if needed, central venous pressure monitoring may help guide therapy of persistent hypotension. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias with intravenous sodium bicarbonate, or lidocaine, if bicarbonate is unsuccessful.  Consider intravenous lipid therapy early for patients with ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension. Manage airway in patients with CNS depression or recurrent seizures. QTc prolongation rarely requires treatment.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended for unintentional ingestions (primarily young children). Consider activated charcoal, if recent, substantial ingestion (greater than 4.5 g) in a patient who is awake or in whom airway is protected, or if concern about coingestants.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Airway management: Usually unnecessary, but perform early if life-threatening cardiac toxicity (ie, conduction delays), coma, or significant CNS depression, or status epilepticus are present.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines, propofol, or barbiturates if seizures recur or persist.<\/li><li>Psychomotor agitation: Sedate patient with benzodiazepines as necessary; large doses may be required.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Dysrhythmias rarely occur. A moderately prolonged QTc (greater than 440 msec) is common. However, this may not be a result of intrinsic cardiac toxicity, but reflects overcorrection in the calculation of QTc due to the tachycardia that occurs. Conduction block and QRS widening are rare; QRS widening may respond to sodium bicarbonate. A reasonable starting dose is 1 to 2 mEq\/kg bolus. Repeat as needed. Endpoints include resolution of dysrhythmias, narrowing of QRS complex, and blood pH 7.45 to 7.55. Use lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate is not successful.<\/li><li>Fat emulsion: Patients who develop significant cardiovascular toxicity should be treated with intravenous lipids. Administer 1.5 mL\/kg of 20% lipid emulsion over 2 to 3 minutes as an IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min. If possible, discontinue after 30 to 60 minutes. Longer periods of lipid therapy should be considered if the patient's hemodynamic stability is dependent on continued lipid infusion.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor vital signs and ECG. With overdose of sustained-release preparations, monitor for 8 to 12 hours for delayed neurotoxicity or seizures.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are NOT of value because of high protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  A retrospective chart review of 407 bupropion ingestions in children (less than 6 years of age) recommended asymptomatic children with unintentional ingestion of bupropion 10 mg\/kg or less to be observed at home. However, the study did not address the outcome based on bupropion formulations (immediate-release versus extended-release). Since patients that have ingested an extended-release or long-acting product have the potential to manifest delayed symptoms, ALL of these patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and monitoring. OBSERVATION CRITERIA:  All patients with INTENTIONAL OVERDOSE and those who are symptomatic should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored, until symptoms (ie, agitation, tremor, hallucinations, and vital sign abnormalities) resolve and receive an appropriate period of observation for the development of seizures. A retrospective chart review of 407 bupropion ingestions in children (less than 6 years of age) recommended that all children with unintentional ingestions of bupropion greater than 10 mg\/kg should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation, treatment and observation. However, the study did not address the outcome based on bupropion formulations (immediate-release versus extended-release). EXTENDED-RELEASE OVERDOSE: ALL PATIENTS who have ingested an extended-release or long-acting product should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. These patients have the potential to manifest symptoms, specifically seizures, in a delayed fashion. Seizures may occur up to 24 hours or longer postingestion with sustained-release formulations. Monitor these patients for a minimum of 24 hours after presentation. They may be discharged if they are asymptomatic and clearly improving.  IMMEDIATE-RELEASE OVERDOSE: Monitor patients for at least 12 hours for the development of seizures and\/or other symptoms after presentation. They may be discharged if they are asymptomatic and clearly improving.  ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate ingestion of a sustained-release products should be admitted, as should a patient who develops, cardiotoxicity, and\/or seizures, or other persistent neurotoxicity (hallucinations, agitation). CONSULT CRITERIA: Call a Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (seizures, dysrhythmias) or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929312-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>BUPROPION<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULT: Seizures are dose-dependent; fatalities are rare. Severe toxicity (status epilepticus and cardiogenic shock) developed in an adult who ultimately survived a 12 g buPROPion ingestion. Another adult developed seizures and fatal cardiac dysrhythmias after ingesting approximately 23 g buPROPion. SUSTAINED RELEASE: Fatalities were reported in one adolescent (16-years-old) and 3 adults following sustained-release buPROPion overdose ingestions in doses ranging from 5.4 to 9 grams. PEDIATRIC: Severe toxicity (recurrent seizures, hypotension, hallucinations) has been reported in children ingesting 48 mg\/kg or more. Children who have ingested doses greater than 10 mg\/kg should be referred to a healthcare facility. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT: Ranges from 150 to 450 mg\/day.
