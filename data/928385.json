PHARMACOLOGY: Pramlintide, an antidiabetic drug, is a stable, non-aggregating analogue of endogenous amylin. It is responsible for the modulation of gastric emptying, prevention of the postprandial glucagon secretion, and satiety which leads to decreased caloric intake and potential weight loss. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Pramlintide overdose information is limited. Severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, vasodilatation, and dizziness were reported in healthy volunteers following administration of single 10-mg doses. Hypoglycemia is not expected after administration of pramlintide alone, but may develop if pramlintide is administered with insulin or other hypoglycemic agents. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most frequently reported adverse effects following therapeutic administration of pramlintide include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and headache. Other adverse effects include abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and a dermal reaction, consisting of erythema, edema, and pruritus. Pramlintide as a sole therapy (without concurrent administration of insulin) does NOT cause hypoglycemia. DRUG INTERACTION: Concomitant administration of pramlintide with one or more antidiabetic agents (eg, insulin, sulfonylureas) increases the risk of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia associated with pramlintide will generally occur within 2 to 3 hours after pramlintide administration. <br\/>"},{"id":"928385-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b> PRAMLINTIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Hypoglycemia is not expected after administration of pramlintide alone, but may develop if pramlintide is administered with insulin or other hypoglycemic agents. In patients with a pramlintide overdose who are also taking insulin or insulin secretogogues, obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. DIET: If the patient is awake and alert, offer carbohydrates. If hypoglycemia persists or becomes severe, treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia. NOT RECOMMENDED: Prophylactic dextrose administration is not recommended in patients who do not become hypoglycemic, as it may make it difficult to distinguish patients who become hypoglycemic and require prolonged hospitalization from those who remain asymptomatic and may be discharged sooner. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Hypoglycemia is not expected after administration of pramlintide alone, but may develop if pramlintide is administered with insulin or other hypoglycemic agents. In patients with a pramlintide overdose who are also taking insulin or insulin secretogogues, obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. Treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary as pramlintide is administered subcutaneously.<\/li><li>Airway management: Generally, airway management is not necessary as CNS depression from these agents should resolve with dextrose administration. Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with excessive drowsiness and the inability to protect their own airway that do not respond to IV dextrose.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypoglycemia: Pramlintide alone does not cause hypoglycemia; however, concomitant administration of pramlintide and other anti-diabetic agents (i.e. insulin, sulfonylureas) may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. DEXTROSE: Give dextrose if symptomatic or BS less than 60 mg\/dL. DOSE: ADULT: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg of D50W (50% dextrose) IV push; ADOLESCENT: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (1 to 2 mL\/kg) of 50% dextrose IV push; INFANT and CHILD: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (2 to 4 mL\/kg) of 25% dextrose IV push. Follow with an infusion of 10% dextrose; titrate to a BS of 100 mg\/dL. DIET: When the patient is awake and alert, supplement IV glucose with carbohydrate intake.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum pramlintide concentrations are not clinically useful in managing overdose. Monitor vital signs in symptomatic patients. In patients with hypoglycemia or concomitant exposure to other hypoglycemic agents, monitor blood glucose every hour for 3 to 4 hours; longer in patients following concomitant overdose with intermediate or long acting insulin or oral hypoglycemics. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant nausea, vomiting and diarrhea following exposure.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is likely not to be of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: All children with inadvertent injections should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Adults with a deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Diabetic adults with an inadvertent injection of an extra dose who are asymptomatic can be monitored at home. Asymptomatic nondiabetic adults with an inadvertent injection of an extra dose can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent overdose of pramlintide can be observed in the Emergency Department and discharged if hypoglycemia resolves after feeding and a few hours of observation.  ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop hypoglycemia should be admitted for a minimum of 24 hours for frequent blood glucose monitoring. They should only be discharged when free of symptoms and are able to maintain euglycemia without supplemental dextrose for 8 hours. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or a poison center for assistance with medical management in patients with severe overdose or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928385-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b> PRAMLINTIDE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
