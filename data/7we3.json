They are nonbarbiturate anxiolytic agents originally developed as skeletal muscle relaxants. They have some anticonvulsant and mild tranquilizing properties. Meprobamate is the active metabolite of carisoprodol, a skeletal muscle relaxant, and has recreational abuse potential. Refer to &quot;SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS - CENTRAL ACTING&quot; document for more specific information. PHARMACOLOGY: Meprobamate depresses central nervous system (CNS) function similar to the barbiturates through GABA-A receptor interaction. At high concentrations it causes chloride ion infusion. Additional precise mechanisms remain unclear, but it appears to inhibit interneurons in the hypothalamus, thalamus, limbic system, and spinal cord. It does not act on the medulla, reticular activating system, or autonomic nervous system and does not cause anesthesia. The skeletal muscle relaxing effects are due to CNS depression. TOXICOLOGY: Extremely high doses induce general anesthesia with resultant respiratory, vasomotor, and CNS depression. Death results from respiratory failure and refractory hypotension due to either direct arterial dilatation, direct myocardial depression, and\/or indirectly from excessive skeletal muscle relaxation. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Meprobamate is an uncommon overdose. Carisoprodol, the prodrug for meprobamate, is commonly abused and its incidence is increasing. Clinical manifestations can be severe and often require intervention. Phenprobamate use has largely been replaced with benzodiazepines. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Meprobamate (and phenprobamate) overdose produces barbiturate-like CNS depression. Headache, weakness, clonus, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, slurred speech, lethargy, and stupor are common. Miosis or mydriasis and nystagmus may be noted. SEVERE TOXICITY: Massive ingestion is often serious and sometimes fatal and may result in tachycardia, refractory hypotension, shock, dysrhythmias, circulatory collapse, pulmonary edema, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, respiratory depression, and prolonged coma. Lethal intoxications are usually associated with mixed ingestions. Bezoars containing large amounts of meprobamate have been reported and may cause prolonged intoxication due to sustained drug absorption. CHRONIC: Chronic intoxication with supratherapeutic doses may cause ataxia, slurred speech, and vertigo. WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME: Meprobamate and carisoprodol produce similar withdrawal syndromes consisting of insomnia, vomiting, tremors, muscle twitching, anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, and ataxia in patients who abruptly stop taking large doses of meprobamate or carisoprodol. ADVERSE EFFECTS: At therapeutic doses, meprobamate may cause drowsiness, ataxia, dizziness, slurred speech, headache, vertigo, weakness, paresthesias, and paradoxical excitement. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, as well as palpitations, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and syncope may occur. Mild allergic reactions include a pruritic, urticarial, or erythematous maculopapular rash which may be generalized or localized to the groin. Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and leukopenia uncommonly occur. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including hyperpyrexia, chills, angioneurotic edema, bronchospasm, oliguria, anuria, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and bullous dermatitis may rarely occur.<br\/><\/li><li><b>SALICYLATES<\/b><br\/>USES: Salicylates are used primarily as an analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet agent. Found in many over-the-counter preparations in oral and topical forms. It may also be found in combination with other agents such as narcotics, barbiturates, and caffeine. Topical forms are often used as rubefacients. Also found in some essential oils in high concentrations such as oil of wintergreen. PHARMACOLOGY: Salicylates inhibit cyclooxygenase, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins, and cause platelet dysfunction. TOXICOLOGY: Salicylates stimulate the respiratory center in the brainstem, interfere with the Krebs cycle (limiting ATP production), uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (causing accumulation of pyruvic and lactic acid and heat production), and increase fatty acid metabolism (generating ketone bodies). The net result is a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Common poisoning which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: GI upset, tinnitus, tachypnea, and respiratory alkalosis. SEVERE TOXICITY: Metabolic acidosis, hyperpnea, diaphoresis, fever, altered mental status, seizures, coma, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema and death. Chronic overdoses present more insidiously and may be subtle, especially in the elderly, and may consist primarily of neurologic manifestations such as confusion, delirium, and agitation. Coagulopathy, hepatic injury, and dysrhythmias are rare complications of severe overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: GI upset and tinnitus.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"7we3s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>MEPROBAMATE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is mainly supportive care including oxygen, IV fluids, and placing the patient on a cardiac monitor. Support the patient's airway and breathing with careful attention to the mental status. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is primarily supportive. Orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be needed for pulmonary edema, respiratory depression, and coma. Treat hypotension with intravenous fluids; if hypotension persists, administer vasopressors. Benzodiazepines can effectively treat seizures in epileptic patients overdosed on meprobamate.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Avoid charcoal because the patient may become more somnolent and lose airway reflexes and the ability to protect the airway. HOSPITAL: Meprobamate may cause bezoars and prolong absorption. Orogastric lavage, activated charcoal, or whole bowel irrigation may be indicated after the patient is intubated IF 1) there is a history of massive ingestion, 2) there is a history of potential lethal coningestants, or 3) a bezoar is suspected and the patient is deteriorating despite interventions. Multidose activated charcoal has been used for severe ingestions and may be safe if used in conjunction with the above guidelines.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is a key issue in severe ingestions. Intubate early if the history is consistent with a massive ingestion or if the patient deteriorates neurologically and\/or hemodynamically.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: There are no specific laboratory tests that help manage meprobamate overdose patients. Meprobamate serum concentrations can be obtained but do not help to manage the acutely ill patient. Monitor vital signs. Continuous pulse oximetry and venous blood gases can provide information on acid-base status. Obtain an ECG and repeat as indicated; continuous cardiac monitoring may be necessary in symptomatic patients. A head CT scan can rule out other causes of CNS depression.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion effectively remove meprobamate and are indicated in patients with severe ingestions who are not responding to supportive care (eg, patients with refractory hypotension, pulmonary edema).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent overdose may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation and evaluation. Symptoms generally manifest in the first few hours after overdose. Children who inadvertently ingested more than one pill should probably be referred to a healthcare facility. Asymptomatic patients may be discharged after observing for approximately 4 hours after ingestion. Bezoars will prolong the symptoms but should not delay symptom onset. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent CNS depression should be admitted. Admit patients requiring respiratory, ventilatory, and\/or hemodynamic support to an ICU setting. Assess neurologic status and ability to maintain a patent airway. Patients may be discharged once they are asymptomatic for approximately 8 hours. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a nephrologist for hemodialysis or hemoperfusion in patients with massive ingestions or who are not responding to supportive care. Consider endoscopy or surgical removal if a bezoar is suspected. Consult a toxicologist for specific guidance for patients with severe toxicity.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>SALICYLATES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: An initial salicylate level should be obtained and repeated every 1 to 2 hours until a clear peak and decline is observed. Start intravenous fluids. Concentrations greater than 30 mg\/dL and rising should be treated with urine alkalinization. The presence of a large anion gap metabolic acidosis or altered mental status indicates a more severe poisoning. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with severe poisoning should be continued on urine alkalinization; hemodialysis should be strongly considered. Relative indications for hemodialysis include: renal failure, congestive heart failure, altered mental status, seizures, evidence of cerebral edema, worsening acidosis despite adequate resuscitation, persistently rising salicylate concentrations despite adequate treatment (greater than 50 to 60 mg\/dL in a chronic poisoning or levels greater than 90 to 100 mg\/dL in an acute overdose). Patients with an altered mental status may have cerebral edema; a head CT should be obtained. Mannitol can be given for cerebral edema. Severely ill patients may require respiratory support and intubation. Maintain preintubation minute ventilation at the same high respiratory rate because once the patient's respiratory drive is removed metabolic acidosis may worsen.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination with activated charcoal can be considered for large ingestions in patients with normal mental status in whom there will be a delay to definitive healthcare, but a poison center should be consulted first. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be administered to any patient who presents within 2 hours of a significant ingestion, can adequately protect their airway, and has no alteration in mental status. Administer activated charcoal to patients with large ingestions who present after 2 hours, as salicylate absorption can be delayed and erratic. Consider the use of gastric lavage for patients that present with large ingestions within 2 hours.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who are comatose or with altered mental status may need mechanical respiratory support and orotracheal intubation. If the patient requires intubation, monitor end tidal CO2 and arterial blood gases frequently and maintain the preintubation minute ventilation to prevent severe acidosis.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain serial salicylate levels every 1 to 2 hours until concentrations have peaked and are declining; basic metabolic panel every 2 hours until clinical improvement; arterial or venous blood gas for patients undergoing urinary alkalinization or moderate\/severe toxicity. In addition, obtain CBC, liver enzymes, renal function studies, INR and PTT in patients with clinical evidence of moderate\/severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Fluid\/electrolyte balance regulation: Correct dehydration with 0.9% saline 10 to 20 mL\/kg\/hour over 1 to 2 hours until a good urine flow is obtained (at least 3 to 6 mL\/kg\/hour).  In patients in whom urinary alkalinization is being considered, initial hydration may be with 10 to 20 mL\/kg of D5W with 88 to 132 mEq of bicarbonate added.  Patients in shock may require more rapid fluid administration. Correct hypokalemia with intravenous potassium boluses and oral potassium. Monitor urine output and pH hourly.<\/li><li>Acidosis: Administer 1 to 2 mEq\/kg NaHCO3 by IV bolus and begin urinary alkalinization.  Monitor blood gases and urinary pH to guide frequency and quantity of administration. Patients with refractory acidosis, inability to maintain appropriate respiratory alkalosis, or acidemia should be treated with hemodialysis.<\/li><li>Alkaline diuresis: Urinary alkalization will increase elimination of salicylates. Place 150 mEq (3 ampules) of NaHCO3 in 1 liter of 5% dextrose to provide an isotonic solution; administer 10 to 20 mL\/kg initially as a bolus, then infuse at 2 to 3 mL\/kg\/hour. Administer 20 to 40 mEq\/L of potassium chloride as an IV infusion as needed to maintain normokalemia. Oral potassium may be administered if tolerated. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia may occur with alkalinization and hypokalemia can prevent the development of an alkaline urine. Monitor serum electrolytes (in particular potassium and calcium), serum and urinary pH frequently (every 1 to 2 hours); goal of therapy is a urine pH of 7.5 to 8.<\/li><li>Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis efficiently removes salicylate and corrects acid base and electrolyte abnormalities. Hemodialysis is recommended in patients with high serum salicylate levels (greater than 90 to 100 mg\/dL after acute overdose, to 50 to 60 mg\/dL with chronic intoxication), refractory acidosis, inability to maintain appropriate respiratory alkalosis, acidemia, evidence of CNS toxicity (i.e., seizures, mental status depression, persistent confusion, coma, and cerebral edema), progressive clinical deterioration despite appropriate fluid therapy and attempted urinary alkalinization, acute lung injury, inability to tolerate sodium bicarbonate (e.g., renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema), refractory\/profound electrolyte disturbances, or renal failure. The clinical condition of the patient is more important than the serum salicylate concentration in determining the need for hemodialysis, especially in patients with chronic toxicity or delayed presentation after acute overdose. In patients with early presentation after acute overdose, serum concentrations approaching 100 mg\/dL warrant consideration for dialysis even with mild or moderate clinical manifestations of toxicity. Administer a second dose of activated charcoal to patients with persistently rising salicylate levels despite urinary alkalinization and an initial dose of activated charcoal. Consider whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol for patients with large ingestions of enteric coated products if they are alert and able to protect the airway.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with inadvertent ingestions of less than 150 mg\/kg or 6.5 g, whichever is less, of aspirin equivalent doses can generally be observed at home with normal follow-up procedures. Consider follow-up at periodic intervals of approximately 12 hours after acute ingestion of non-enteric coated salicylate products or 24-hours for enteric-coated aspirin. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have a rising salicylate concentration, metabolic acidosis, or alterations in mental status should be admitted to an intensive care setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with intentional ingestions and those with unintentional ingestions greater than 150 mg\/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin equivalent doses, whichever is less, should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. For oil of wintergreen (98% methylsalicylate), greater than a lick or taste by children under 6 years of age or greater than 4 mL by patients 6 years of age and older requires referral to an emergency department for evaluation. Patients who have a well defined peak and decline in salicylate concentration and mild to moderate symptoms that resolve with treatment can often be treated and released from an ED observation unit. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing severe poisonings and for recommendations on determining the need for hemodialysis. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy who do not require referral to a healthcare facility for other reasons (ie ingested dose or symptoms) should be referred to an obstetrician for outpatient follow up and assessment of maternal fetal risk.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"7we3s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>MEPROBAMATE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY:.
