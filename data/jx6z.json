PHARMACOLOGY: Pralatrexate, an antineoplastic folate analog, is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor. Additionally, it is a competitive inhibitor for polyglutamylation via the folylpolyglutamyl synthetase enzyme. TOXICOLOGY: After an overdose, the effects of decreased DNA synthesis and cell death may be noticed primarily in organ systems with rapidly dividing cells (eg, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: There are no reports of toxicity following acute overdose. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses, particularly myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting and mucositis. ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: Mucositis, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and fatigue. The following adverse effects have also been reported: Edema, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, fever, night sweats, hypokalemia, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, abdominal pain, anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, back pain, asthenia, cough, epistaxis, dyspnea, pharyngolaryngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, and fever. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Probenecid, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents may reduce pralatrexate elimination and increase the risk of toxicity.<br\/>"},{"id":"jx6zs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PRALATREXATE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Administer intravenous fluids and antiemetics.  Maintain hydration and adequate urine output. Administer colony-stimulating factor to patients with severe neutropenia at risk for neutropenic sepsis. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: In addition to the above, administer intravenous leucovorin as soon as possible. <\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports are available; the following information is derived from experience with methotrexate.  After an overdose,  keep the patient upright and perform cerebrospinal fluid drainage; this is probably sufficient therapy in patients with less than 7-fold overdose or less than 100 mg of methotrexate.  CSF exchange and ventriculolumbar perfusion should be performed after large overdoses  Administration of corticosteroids (dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 doses) and leucovorin (100 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 doses) also may help.   DO NOT ADMINISTER LEUCOVORIN INTRATHECALLY.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Decontamination is not necessary; pralatrexate is administered intravenously.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may rarely be required in patients with severe CNS and cardiac toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: No clinical reports are available; the following information is derived from experience with methotrexate. LEUCOVORIN: Leucovorin calcium should be given as soon as possible (ideally within the first hour).  In most cases, leucovorin 100 mg\/m(2) IV infused over 15 to 30 minutes every 3 to 6 hours for several days is sufficient.  NEVER administer leucovorin intrathecally.   THYMIDINE: Thymidine can ameliorate cellular toxicity from methotrexate and is given at a dose of 8 g\/m(2)\/day via continuous infusion.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, serial CBC with differential, serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes. Obtain a chest radiograph in patients with respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: No clinical reports are available; the following information is derived from experience with methotrexate. High flux hemodialysis can clear methotrexate in patients with renal failure, but it has not been used after overdose.   Pralatrexate is approximately 67% protein bound in blood and has a steady-state Vd of 37 L (R-diastereomer) and 105 L (S-diastereomer); hemodialysis may be of some benefit shortly after large overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management, as leucovorin rescue is most effective when given early. All exposures should be evaluated in a health care facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation. If patients are asymptomatic for 6 hours, they may be sent home as long as close follow up can be arranged. Since toxic effects may be delayed, patients should return to a healthcare provider for serial monitoring. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any symptomatic patients should be admitted to the hospital, and depending on the severity of their symptoms, either to the floor or ICU.  Criteria for discharge should be improvement in laboratory analyses and resolution of symptoms. CONSULT CRITERIA:  A medical toxicologist or poison center should be consulted on symptomatic cases, as well as and oncologist familiar with giving the drug and its adverse side effects.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jx6zs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PRALATREXATE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established.
