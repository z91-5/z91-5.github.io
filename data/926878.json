Goserelin acetate is indicated for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer and advanced breast cancer, and for the management of endometriosis. Histrelin acetate and triptorelin pamoate are indicated for palliative therapy of advanced prostate cancer. Nafarelin nasal solution is indicated for the management of endometriosis and for the treatment of central precocious puberty in children. Follitropin alfa\/lutropin alfa combination product is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone deficiency. PHARMACOLOGY: Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists will initially stimulate the release of pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), resulting in a transient increase of gonadal steroidogenesis. However, chronic administration of the LH-RH agonists results in inhibition of gonadotropin secretion leading to suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. Ongoing therapy with these agents results in a decrease in estrogen and testosterone levels which can lead to a variety of symptoms. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. Severe toxicity is not expected. OVERDOSE: Overdose information is limited. It is anticipated that overdose effects would be an extension of adverse effects reported with therapeutic use. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Initial administration of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists may result in disease \"flare\" characterized by increased bone pain, urinary obstruction, or spinal cord compression, and may last for 1 to 2 weeks of administration. Continued therapy results in a decrease in estrogen and testosterone levels, leading to a variety of related adverse effects including flushing, acne, headaches, depression, gynecomastia, impotence, decreased libido, amenorrhea, vaginal dryness, and osteopenia. Other adverse effects, reported with LH-RH agonist therapy, include injection site reactions (ie, pain, erythema, swelling, bruising), edema, rashes, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and weight gain. RARE: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, and pituitary apoplexy have been rarely reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"926878-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LUTEINIZING HORMONE RELEASING HORMONE AGONISTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most exposures are mild and require only supportive care. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Significant toxicity is not expected after an overdose. For patients with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, initiate intravenous hydration, monitor fluid input and output, and initiate deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated since these medications are administered via the intramuscular or subcutaneous route or intranasally.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is not likely to be an issue.

Obtain a pelvic ultrasound if ovarian hyperstimulation is a concern.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with unintentional exposure may be observed at home if asymptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients with uncontrollable nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. Patients may be discharged if asymptomatic 6 hours after exposure. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients requiring ongoing supportive care may need admission. Patients with evidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may require admission.
