It is used for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. PHARMACOLOGY: Inhibits neuronal norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake; thus potentiating the serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS. TOXICOLOGY: Primarily sympathomimetic activity, potential for serotonin syndrome. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. It is anticipated that overdose effects may be an extension of events reported with therapeutic use. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (5% or greater or at least twice the rate of placebo): Nausea, vomiting, constipation, hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, palpitations, and erectile dysfunction. OTHER EFFECTS: Orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, urinary hesitation, and mydriasis. RARE: Hyponatremia, bleeding events, serotonin syndrome, and suicidal thoughts. <br\/>"},{"id":"930746-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LEVOMILNACIPRAN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. For severe hypotension, administer intravenous fluids and vasopressors. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital activated charcoal is not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and rarely, seizures. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a potentially toxic ingestion who is able to maintain airway or if airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation may be necessary if severe serotonin syndrome develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Sedate with benzodiazepines. Consider cyproheptadine in patients with more severe manifestations who are able to take oral medications: ADULT: 12 mg orally initially, then 2 mg every 2 hours if manifestations persist (maximum 32 mg in 24 hours), maintenance dose 8 mg every 6 hours. CHILDREN: 0.25 mg\/kg\/day divided every 6 hours, maximum 12 mg\/day. If hyperthermic control agitation\/rigidity (benzodiazepines) and initiate external cooling measures (undress patient, cover with wet sheet and direct fan at skin). In severe cases, neuromuscular blockade (non-depolarizing agents) may be necessary. Treat hypotension with intravenous 0.9% saline, if pressors are necessary direct acting (norepinephrine, phentolamine) are preferred.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding therapy after overdose. Monitor vital signs and serum electrolytes levels in symptomatic patients. Monitor neurologic exam for evidence of mental status depression or serotonin syndrome. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to the fairly large volume of distribution of levomilnacipran, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are NOT likely to be beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with a small inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All symptomatic patients and those with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate ingestion demonstrating cardiotoxicity, seizure activity, or other persistent neurotoxicity should be admitted.
