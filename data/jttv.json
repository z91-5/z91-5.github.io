The rate of passive uptake is determined by the membrane permeability of the drug and the surface area of the vascular beds to which it is exposed; thus myocardial uptake is related to myocardial blood flow. While the mechanism of myocardial retention is not completely understood, its distribution in myocardium appears to be analogous to that of thallous chloride Tl 201. When injected at rest, technetium Tc 99m sestamibi appears to accumulate in viable myocardial tissue; infarcts are thus delineated as areas of lack of accumulation. When injected at stress (either exercise or pharmacologic vasodilation), technetium Tc 99m sestamibi accumulates in myocardial tissue in relation to myocardial blood flow; thus ischemic areas (e.g., those supplied by stenotic vessels) are detected as areas of less accumulation. <\/li><li>Parathyroid imaging and<\/li><li>Thyroid imaging-Although the precise mechanism of tumor localization is unclear, it has been suggested that technetium Tc 99m sestamibi passively crosses cell membranes and is concentrated primarily within cytoplasm and mitochondria. It has been proposed that malignant cells, because of their increased metabolic rate, maintain greater negative mitochondrial and transmembrane potentials, thus enhancing intracellular accumulation of technetium Tc 99m sestamibi. In thyroid glands with hyperthyroidism, blood flow and the number of mitochondria are increased, which may explain the uptake of technetium Tc 99m sestamibi in hyperthyroid glands. Localization of technetium Tc 99m sestamibi appears to be dependent on blood flow to the tissue, the concentration of technetium Tc 99m sestamibi presented to the tissue, and the size of the gland. <\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"jttvs8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"3":{"id":"jttvs8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: 33%; Renal: 27% <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"jttvs8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Myocardium: 3 to 6 h<\/li><li>Liver: 28 to 30 min<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"jttvs9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>prior to adding the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection to the vial, tear off a radiation symbol and attach it to the neck of the vial<\/li><li>waterproof gloves should be worn during the preparation procedure.
