PHARMACOLOGY: Pentetate calcium trisodium (Ca-DTPA) increases the rates of radiocontaminant elimination by forming stable chelates with metal ions. The calcium ion is exchanged for ions with higher binding capacity. The radioactive chelates are then excreted into the urine by glomerular filtration. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Deaths have been reported in patients with severe hemochromatosis who received up to 4 times the recommended daily dose via intramuscular injection. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Chest pain, fever, chills, headache, lightheadedness, dermatitis, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, diarrhea, and Injection site reactions have been reported following therapeutic use of pentetate zinc trisodium (Ca-DTPA). In addition, Ca-DTPA therapy has been associated with trace element deficiency including zinc, magnesium, and manganese depletion. Cough and\/or wheezing have been reported in 2 patients who received nebulized Ca-DTPA; one patient had a history of asthma. <br\/>"},{"id":"jwb1s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b> PENTETATE CALCIUM TRISODIUM <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any electrolyte abnormalities, as necessary.  NOTE: A patient exposed to radiation requires concomitant monitoring and treatment for radiation toxicity; see RADIATION management, as appropriate.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral or inhalational routes.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor CBC with differential, renal function, and serum electrolytes (including calcium, zinc, magnesium and manganese). Measure the radioactivity in blood, urine, and fecal samples weekly to monitor the radioactive contaminant elimination rate. A baseline estimate of the total body burden of transuranium element should be obtained by whole-body counting and bioassay when possible.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no information regarding the effectiveness of hemodialysis or hemoperfusion for the removal of pentetate calcium trisodium from plasma.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Home exposure is very unlikely to occur. A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients with underlying cardiac abnormalities may require ECG monitoring in addition to electrolyte\/fluid analysis. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant gastrointestinal symptoms and persistent electrolyte imbalances likely need to be admitted for further treatment and monitoring. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or for whom diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jwb1s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b> PENTETATE CALCIUM TRISODIUM <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Pentetate calcium trisodium (Ca-DTPA) is usually well-tolerated. Deaths have been reported in 3 patients with severe hemochromatosis who received up to 4 times the recommended daily dose via intramuscular injection. After receiving 14 grams of Ca-DTPA, one patient became comatose and died. The other two patients died after 14 days of daily treatment. Another patient with a less severe case of hemochromatosis did not experience any adverse effects after receiving 30 grams of Ca-DTPA by intravenous injection over 12 days. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS: 1 g IV as a single dose initially and then once daily as maintenance dose (only if Zn-DTPA is not available); diluted in 100 to 250 mL D5W, LR or NS; either give by slow IV push over 3 to 4 min or IV infusion. CHILDREN: Less than 12 years: 14 mg\/kg IV as a single dose initially and then once daily as maintenance dose (only if Zn-DTPA is not available); MAX: 1 g\/day.
