directly increasing the excretion of sodium and chloride.

This leads to the increase in aldosterone secretion by angiotensin II and an increase in potassium secretion.<\/li><li>Irbesartan acts by competitively blocking the effects of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, by binding at the angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) receptor. This blocks the pressor effect of angiotensin II and inhibits aldosterone release by the adrenal cortex in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Blocking angiotensin II also inhibits aldosterone synthesis and secretion, cardiac contraction, renal resorption of sodium, smooth muscle growth and sympathetic activity.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924946-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"924946-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Hydrochlorothiazide, Bioavailability: (Oral, elderly), time to peak concentration, 20% to 50% greater than young adults<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Oral tablet: rapid and complete, time to peak concentration, 1.5 h to 2 h<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Bioavailability: (Oral), 60% to 80%<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Bioavailability: (Oral, black subjects), area under the concentration time curve is 25% greater than white subjects<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Effect of food: (Oral), no effect on bioavailability<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924946-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Hydrochlorothiazide, Vd: 3.5 L\/kg (Chen &amp; Chiou, 1992)<\/li><li>Hydrochlorothiazide, Protein binding: 40%<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Vd: 53 L to 93 L<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Protein binding: 90%<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924946-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Hydrochlorothiazide; not metabolized<\/li><li>Irbesartan-Hepatic; via isoenzyme P450 CYP2C9 and glucuronidation<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924946-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Hydrochlorothiazide, Renal: 61% unchanged<\/li><li>Hydrochlorothiazide, Dialyzable: not determined<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Fecal: majority recovered in feces<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Renal: 20%<\/li><li>Irbesartan, Dialyzable: no (hemodialysis)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924946-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Hydrochlorothiazide: 10 to 12 hours (Chen &amp; Chiou, 1992)<\/li><li>Irbesartan: 11 h to 15 h<\/li><\/ul>"}]},{"id":"924946-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>may be administered with or without food or with other hypertensive drugs <br\/>"},{"id":"924946-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>blood pressure<\/li><li>renal function<\/li><li>serum electrolytes; periodically<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924946-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: (Hydrochlorothiazide - Irbesartan) 12.5 MG-150 MG, 12.5 MG-300 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Avalide<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: (Hydrochlorothiazide - Irbesartan) 12.5 MG-150 MG, 12.5 MG-300 MG, 25 MG-300 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924946-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"924946-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/>USES: Class of drugs that are primarily used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Potassium sparing diuretics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Work in a variety of mechanisms including inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (thiazides), inhibiting transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle (loop), and osmotic agents (mannitol). TOXICOLOGY: Produce hypovolemia and electrolyte deficiencies. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Rare overdose which uncommonly results in significant morbidity or death. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild dehydration, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, headache, muscle cramps, thirst, and brisk diuresis. Large doses of furosemide or ethacrynic acid can cause ototoxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, mental status changes, and electrolyte abnormalities (i.e. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia) are the most common manifestations of severe poisoning. Rarely muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, coma, or dysrhythmias may develop secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities.  CNS depression has been reported rarely in children with acute ingestion without significant electrolyte abnormalities. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Thiazides are associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Furosemide has been associated with ototoxicity, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  Diuretics have a large number of drug interactions as well. Extravasation of mannitol can cause tissue injury and compartment syndrome.<br\/>"},{"id":"924946-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients with minor symptoms can be managed with supportive care only.
