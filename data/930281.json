PHARMACOLOGY: Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that competitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors and inhibits androgen receptor nuclear translocation and interaction with DNA. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Seizures have been reported following enzalutamide doses of 360 mg to 600 mg. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (5% or greater): Asthenia\/fatigue, back pain, diarrhea, arthralgia, hot flush, peripheral edema, musculoskeletal pain, headache, upper respiratory infection, muscular weakness, dizziness, insomnia, lower respiratory infection, spinal cord compression and cauda equina syndrome, hematuria, paresthesia, anxiety, neutropenia, and hypertension. OTHER EFFECTS: Pruritus and dry skin, pollakiuria, elevations in bilirubin, nonpathologic fractures, hypoesthesia, seizures, mental impairment disorders, including amnesia, memory impairment, cognitive disorder, and attention disturbances. Enzalutamide is classified as FDA pregnancy category X. <br\/>"},{"id":"930281-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ENZALUTAMIDE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Neutropenia has been reported. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the risk of persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is alert and able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with persistent seizures.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Administer colony stimulating factors in patients who develop severe neutropenia or neutropenic sepsis. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor CBC with differential with platelet count, renal function, and liver enzymes after significant overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of an extra dose, or a child that remains asymptomatic after 1 or 2 pills can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, ingestions of more than an extra dose in an adult or 2 pills in child, and those who are symptomatic should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation with frequent monitoring of vital signs and mental status. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe neutropenia or persistent seizures should be admitted to the hospital.
