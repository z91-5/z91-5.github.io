Multiple studies have utilized dexmedetomidine for greater than 24 hours; therefore, it may be a safe and effective sedative when used for longer than 24 hours. PHARMACOLOGY: Dexmedetomidine is a specific and selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist. It has a significantly higher alpha-2\/alpha-1 selectivity ratio than does clonidine. TOXICOLOGY: It is anticipated that dexmedetomidine can produce hypotension and bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli and sympathetic outflow. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Limited data exists on overdose. It is anticipated that overdose events may be an extension of the adverse events observed. Overdose may result in oversedation, bradycardia and hypotension. In a series of 3 inadvertent overdoses, deep hypnosis developed, which resolved within one hour of drug discontinuation. First and second degree AV block have been reported. Cardiac arrest developed in one patient receiving a bolus loading dose of undiluted dexmedetomidine (19.4 mcg\/kg); recovery was uneventful. ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: The most frequently reported adverse events include: hypotension (28%), hypertension (16%) {associated with loading dose administration}, bradycardia (7%), tachycardia (3%) and hypoxia (4%). Dexmedetomidine decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, therefore bradycardia and hypotension may be profound in some patients including the elderly, hypovolemic patients or patients with significant comorbidity (e.g., diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension). Other events include atrial fibrillation (4%), fever (5%), vomiting (4%), hemorrhage (3%), and anemia (3%). Respiratory depression is rare, despite doses that produce marked sedation. INFREQUENT EVENTS: Hyperpyrexia, pain, hyperglycemia, acidosis, pleural effusion, oliguria and thirst may develop. WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME: Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt dose reduction or sudden cessation of therapy, similar to clonidine and other centrally acting antihypertensive agents. Symptoms include, but are not limited to, nausea, vomiting, agitation, palpitations, and hypertension.<br\/>"},{"id":"925159-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DEXMEDETOMIDINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Transient hypertension may develop after exposure; treatment is usually not indicated. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Symptomatic bradycardia can be treated with atropine.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Not indicated. Drug administered via the intravenous route.<\/li><li>Airway management: A decrease in respiratory function is generally not anticipated with dexmedetomidine when given alone, but it may produce significant respiratory depression when combined with centrally acting depressant agents (eg, opioids).  Assess respiratory rate and effort closely following exposure; administer oxygen, assist ventilation and intubate if clinically indicated.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and pulse oximetry. Hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory depression may develop. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. Monitor neurologic function. Specific laboratory tests are not necessary following inadvertent exposure, unless otherwise clinically indicated.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:   There is no data to support home management; dexmedetomidine is generally only used in the hospital setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who are symptomatic should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. HOSPITAL ADMISSION: Patients with dysrhythmias or severe respiratory distress require ICU admission. CONSULT CRITERIA:  Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"925159-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>DEXMEDETOMIDINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Limited data. Three patients received an inadvertent overdose in the perioperative setting: one patient received a dose of 192 mcg (2.6 times the prescribed dose) over 20 minutes; one received 4 and 2 mcg\/kg\/hr instead of 0.4 and 0.2 mcg\/kg\/hr and the third patient received 0.5 mcg\/kg\/min rather than 0.5 mcg\/kg\/hr. The major clinical effect in all three was oversedation, which resolved with the discontinuation of the infusion. In a study of healthy subjects receiving doses approximately 13 times the upper limit of therapeutic range, transient AV block (first and second degree) developed which resolved spontaneously. One patient receive a bolus dose of 19.4 mcg\/kg undiluted dexmedetomidine and had a cardiac arrest from which he was successfully resuscitated. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: For sedation, intubated\/mechanically ventilated ICU patients: ADULT: Initial dose: 1 mcg\/kg over 10 min; Maintenance: 0.2 to 0.7 mcg\/kg\/hr infusion for a maximum of 24 hours. Procedural sedation: ADULT: Initial dose: 0.5 to 1 mcg\/kg over 10 min; Maintenance: 0.6 mcg\/kg\/hr initially and adjust to 0.2 to 1 mcg\/kg\/hr for a maximum of 24 hours.
