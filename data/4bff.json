SEVERE: Hypocalcemia, nephrotoxicity with excessive dosages, injection site reactions, thrombophlebitis, and scaling eczema. <br\/>"},{"id":"4bffs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>EDETATE DISODIUM<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Focus should be on evaluating the patient for clinical, laboratory and ECG evidence of hypocalcemia and instituting aggressive calcium replacement therapy.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Acute toxicity would be expected to follow rapid intravenous administration; gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary.<\/li><li>Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia may develop abruptly. Aggressive calcium replacement should be instituted in patients with clinical or ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia even if laboratory confirmation of hypocalcemia is still pending. Administer 10 mL to 20 mL of 10% calcium chloride or calcium gluconate (initial bolus) IV over 10 to 15 minutes.  More rapid administration may be necessary in patients with dysrhythmias.  Repeat bolus or a maintenance infusion is often necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Administer IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Central venous pressure monitoring may be indicated to guide fluid therapy.<\/li><li>Hypomagnesemia: Correct known and suspected hypomagnesemia with intravenous magnesium sulfate. DOSE: ADULT: MILD hypomagnesemia, 1 to 2 g (magnesium sulfate 50% solution; 8.12 mEq) IV infusion, may be repeated as needed. SEVERE hypomagnesemia, up to 5 g (40 mEq) in 1 L of D5W or NS by slow IV infusion over 3 hours. INTRAMUSCULAR: IM route may be used if IV access cannot be obtained.  For mild hypomagnesemia 1 g (magnesium sulfate 50% solution; 8.12 mEq) IM every 6 hours for 4 doses. For severe hypomagnesemia 250 mg\/kg (magnesium sulfate 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of 4 hours. PEDIATRIC: 25 to 50 mg\/kg IV infusion over 30 to 60 minutes; repeat dose as necessary; max 2 g\/dose. Monitor serum magnesium.<\/li><li>Fluid\/electrolyte balance regulation: Maintain good urine output (3 to 6 milliliters\/kilogram\/hour) with intravenous fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes, including calcium (preferably ionized) and renal function. Obtain an ECG (prolonged QTc suggests hypocalcemia), and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for clinical evidence of hypocalcemia:  perioral tingling, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign, muscle spasms, numbness, and tetany.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"4bffs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>EDETATE DISODIUM<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Range of toxicity not established. Toxicity is dependent on both total dosage and rate of administration, and the serum calcium. A 2-year-old girl died 4 hours after receiving 300 mg of edetate disodium over 4 hours. A 5-year-old boy died shortly after receiving 990 mg of IV edetate disodium over 5 to 10 minutes. A 53-year-old woman died shortly after receiving 1500 mg of edetate disodium over 10 to 15 minutes. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT - 50 mg\/kg\/day IV over 3 hr or more, daily for 5 days, skip 2 days, repeat as needed up to 15 doses, MAX 3 g\/day.
