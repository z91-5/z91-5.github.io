PHARMACOLOGY: Mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and complete metabolism to mycophenolic acid, which is the active metabolite. Mycophenolic acid is a potent, selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase thereby inhibiting the de novo synthesis pathway of guanosine nucleotides without being incorporated into DNA. Mycophenolic acid exerts a potent cytostatic effect on B and T lymphocytes by inhibiting de novo synthesis because it is a crucial pathway for proliferation. TOXICOLOGY: Because mycophenolate is an immunosuppressant, it can also increase risk of infection, lymphoma, and lymphoproliferative disorders. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: There are limited reports of overdose with mycophenolate mofetil.  Since many adverse effects are dose-dependent, it is anticipated that overdose effects may be an extension of events reported with therapeutic use. Nausea and mild abdominal cramping were observed 4 hours after a woman with lupus nephritis ingested 10 gram of mycophenolate mofetil (5 times her therapeutic dose). A kidney recipient developed anorexia, lethargy, headache, and moderate leukopenia after ingesting 25 grams of mycophenolate mofetil. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, hypertension, and sepsis. An increase in certain types of infections (eg, cytomegalovirus) have also been reported with mycophenolate mofetil. OTHER EFFECTS: Hypotension, fever, peripheral edema, rash, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, renal dysfunction, urinary tract infection, elevated liver enzymes, dyspnea, respiratory infection, pleural effusion, cough, tremor, anxiety and paraesthesia, heart failure, dysrhythmias, gastrointestinal bleeding, colitis, meningitis, and thrombophlebitis. In postmarketing reports, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatalities has been observed with mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept(R)) use in transplant patients and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. <br\/>"},{"id":"923344-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MYCOPHENOLATE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Hypertension is commonly reported in transplant patients after receiving mycophenolate mofetil. Monitor blood pressure.  Treatment may be limited to monitoring and evaluating the patient's response following an acute exposure. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Leukopenia is a common adverse effect of therapy. Anemia and thrombocytopenia have also been reported during therapy.  Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelet count after a significant exposure. Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, severe respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or hemodynamic instability.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs.

Mycophenolic acid and MPAG (the phenolic glucuronide of MPA) are not removed by dialysis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with a small, inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home.
