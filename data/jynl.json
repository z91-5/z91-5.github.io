To avoid maltose interference, monitor blood glucose during therapy with glucose-specific methods (ie, monitor and test strips) in diabetic patients. Thrombosis may occur with or without known risk factors. Risk of thrombosis is increased with advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, estrogen use, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer IVIG at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration.
