Inhalation anesthetics probably act on nerve cell membranes to disrupt neuronal transmission in the brain . These agents have been shown to bind to and alter membrane proteins , to alter cellular calcium ion processes , and to augment the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on synaptic transmission . The Meyer-Overton theory, which is based on the observation that there is a strong correlation between the potency of an inhalation anesthetic and its solubility in oil, suggests that the effects of these agents may be at least partially mediated via an action at the lipid matrix of the neuronal membrane .<\/li><li>Cardiovascular system effects, Blood pressure: Like other potent inhalation anesthetics, desflurane usually causes dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure   that may reflect the depth of anesthesia . However, in clinical studies, hypertension occasionally developed during or shortly following induction of anesthesia in patients receiving desflurane .<\/li><li>Cardiac function: Desflurane depresses myocardial function ; it may decrease contractility and possibly compliance . However, after prolonged administration (several hours), some of the cardiovascular depressant effects may be attenuated . Indirect stimulation induced by hypercarbia in spontaneously breathing patients may partially oppose the direct cardiopressant effects of the anesthetic . During desflurane administration, indicators of cardiac function (e.g., cardiac index, stroke volume, and central venous pressure) are higher in spontaneously breathing patients than in mechanically ventilated patients .<\/li><li>Cardiac function: Use of desflurane for induction of anesthesia may be associated with myocardial ischemia in patients with significant cardiovascular disease unless an agent that blunts the sympathetic response, e.g., an opioid, is administered concurrently .<\/li><li>Cardiac function: One study has shown that desflurane is not likely to sensitize the myocardium to the ventricular arrhythmogenic effects of catecholamines or other sympathomimetics .<\/li><li>Cardiovascular function: Some of desflurane's cardiovascular effects may be at least partially reversed by surgical stimulation or stress (e.g., skin incision) . Also, concurrent use of nitrous oxide (60%) reduces the requirement for desflurane and may therefore attenuate the cardiovascular effects observed with desflurane alone , especially in mechanically ventilated patients .<\/li><li>Heart\/pulse rate: May be increased by desflurane, especially when high concentrations are given   during induction , when concentrations are increased rapidly , or after prolonged administration . An increase in heart rate therefore cannot be used as an indication of inadequate anesthesia .<\/li><li>Peripheral vasculature: Desflurane may cause vasodilatation .<\/li><li>Central nervous system (CNS) effects, Electroencephalogram (EEG): Desflurane produces a dose-dependent decrease in EEG activity . It does not produce convulsive activity in the EEG   (as has been observed with enflurane ).<\/li><li>Central nervous system (CNS) effects, Effect on intracranial pressure: Desflurane dilates cerebral arterioles . In clinical trials, concentrations of 1 MAC   or higher   (but not 0.5   or 0.8 MAC ) increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure in patients undergoing craniotomy for removal of tumors despite use of measures that prevent or attenuate the increase in intracranial pressure induced by equivalent concentrations of other halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics, i.e., establishment of hypocapnia and barbiturate administration . However, in another study, 1 or 1.5 MAC of desflurane did not increase cerebral blood flow in patients undergoing craniotomies under hypocapnic conditions .<\/li><li>Neuromuscular effects: Desflurane impairs neuromuscular conduction and decreases muscle contractility . Its neuromuscular blocking activity is equivalent to that of enflurane   or isoflurane . Like these other agents , desflurane may produce muscle relaxation sufficient to permit many types of surgery to be performed without a neuromuscular blocking agent.<\/li><li>Respiratory system effects, Respiration: Desflurane produces dose-dependent respiratory depression . It increases arterial carbon dioxide tension and respiratory rate and decreases tidal volume . In concentrations higher than 1.5 MAC, desflurane may cause apnea . Respiratory depression induced by inhalation anesthetics may be partially reversed with surgical stimulation or stress .<\/li><li>Respiratory system effects, Effects on the airway: Desflurane is an irritant to the airway   and may cause breath-holding, coughing, increased secretions, and laryngospasm   as well as increased sympathetic nervous system activity   during induction. These effects may not be attenuated by increasing the inspired concentration slowly , premedicating with an opioid (e.g., fentanyl) , and\/or administering nitrous oxide concurrently .<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"922196-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"922196-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Inhalation-Systemic: Rapid .<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"922196-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Inhalation-Systemic: Hepatic: minimal    (0.02%) <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"922196-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Inhalation-Systemic: Renal: &lt; 0.02%; Respiratory: primarily; Skin: very small amounts<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"922196-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Inhalation<\/b><br\/>only administer with a vaporizer specifically designed and designated for use with desflurane <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"922196-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>Induction or maintenance of anesthesia<\/li><li>Urine flow<\/li><li>Signs and symptoms of laryngospasm, especially in pediatric patients<\/li><li>Signs and symptoms of airway narrowing, especially in pediatric patients<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"922196-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patient should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination until drug effects are realized.<\/li><li>Side effects may include coughing, breath holding, apnea, nausea, and vomiting.<\/li><li>Advise patient that there are multiple significant drug-drug interactions for this drug.
