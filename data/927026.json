hydrochloride is an antihyperglycemic agent, which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.<\/li><li>Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic agents, improves glycemic control by improving insulin sensitivity while reducing circulating insulin levels. Rosiglitazone is a highly selective and potent agonist for the for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). PPAR receptors are found in key target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. Activation of PPARgamma nuclear receptors regulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport, and utilization.

PHARMACOLOGY: These agents decrease hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and increase peripheral glucose uptake. TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after acute overdose, as they do not stimulate insulin release. Severe lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially fatal side effect mainly in patients with renal insufficiency, hepatic disease, alcoholism, and advanced age. It can be precipitated by iodinated contrast agents. Metformin inhibits both hepatic lactate uptake and conversion of lactate to glucose. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but severe toxicity is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and myalgia. Acute pancreatitis has been reported in one case report. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe lactic acidosis, confusion, mental status depression, hypothermia, hypotension, and renal failure may develop.  Rarely, ventricular dysrhythmias, respiratory insufficiency, and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal pain, anorexia, headache, and rash. SERIOUS EFFECTS: Lactic acidosis (generally only in patients with renal insufficiency or hepatic disease) and megaloblastic anemia. Hypotension, ventricular extrasystoles, and myocardial infarction have been reported with therapeutic doses. DRUG INTERACTION: Use of radiocontrast dyes in patients taking metformin increases the risk of renal failure and acidosis.

TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after an acute overdose, although it has been reported after therapeutic use in patients also taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Mechanism of fluid retention and hepatotoxicity not elucidated. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common, rarely resulting in toxicity. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited human data, although hypoglycemia has been reported in clinical trials and animal studies. SEVERE TOXICITY: Minimal human data. Peripheral edema, congestive heart failure and hepatotoxicity have been reported after chronic therapy, but not after acute overdose. Its anticipated that effects may be similar to adverse effects reported during therapeutic use. ADVERSE EFFECTS: THIAZOLIDINEDIONES: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight gain, hypotension, hypertension, macular edema, edema, transaminitis, anemia, loss of bone density and hypersensitivity reactions can occur. SEVERE EFFECTS: Liver failure, bladder tumors, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, bladder tumors and Stevens-Johnson syndrome can develop. PIOGLITAZONE: The following have occurred with therapy: edema, hypoglycemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, paresthesia, and elevations of creatine phosphokinase. ROSIGLITAZONE: Headache, respiratory tract infection, fluid retention, weight gain, anemia, hepatic failure and hepatocellular injury have been reported. Based on previous postmarketing experience, myocardial ischemic events were associated with angina or myocardial infarction. In 2013, the FDA determined that rosiglitazone does not produce an increase risk of myocardial infarction compared to other antidiabetic (ie, metformin and sulfonylurea) agents. Limitations on prescribing and dispensing recommendations have been removed. However, ongoing monitoring of rosiglitazone will continue to assess and evaluate for any increase in myocardial ischemic events.
