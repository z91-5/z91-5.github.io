Possible mechanisms include: increased liver mitochondrial beta-oxidation, increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity, inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and decreased liver lipogenesis. Furthermore, omega-3-carboxylic acids may decrease the production of liver triglycerides because they are poor substrates for the enzymes that participate in triglyceride synthesis, and they inhibit esterification of other fatty acids.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"930947-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"930947-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Tmax, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): 5 to 8 hours<\/li><li>Tmax, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA): 5 to 9 hours<\/li><li>Effects of food, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA): No change in AUC<\/li><li>Effects of food, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): Increased AUC<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930947-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters <br\/>"},{"id":"930947-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Liver: primary <br\/>"},{"id":"930947-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: None<\/li><li>Total body clearance, DHA: 518 mL\/hr<\/li><li>Total body clearance, EPA: 548 mL\/hr<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930947-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>DHA, 46 hours<\/li><li>EPA, 37 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}]},"9":{"id":"930947-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>take with or without food<\/li><li>swallow capsules whole without dissolving or chewing<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"930947-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>reduction in fasting triglyceride levels indicate efficacy<\/li><li>LDL-C levels; periodically during therapy<\/li><li>AST and ALT; periodically in patients with hepatic impairment<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"930947-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Warn patient that drug is derived from fish oils.
