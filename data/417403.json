Corticosteroids are available in oral, parenteral, inhalational, and topical formulations. PHARMACOLOGY: Multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions. Anti-inflammatory effects result from decreased formation, release and activity of the mediators of inflammation (eg, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) which reduced the initial manifestations of the inflammatory process. The immunosuppressive properties decrease the response to delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, type III and type IV).  The antiproliferative effects reduce hyperplastic tissue characteristic of psoriasis. TOXICOLOGY: Corticosteroids decrease calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion, and inhibit osteoblast formation, leading to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute toxicity following overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Acute ingestion is rarely a clinical problem. Acute adrenal insufficiency rarely reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial fibrillation)(methylPREDNISolone), seizures (methylPREDNISolone), anaphylaxis. CHRONIC EXPOSURE:  Cushingoid appearance, muscle wasting and weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia, subcapsulary cataracts and glaucoma, osteoporosis, psychosis. ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL:  Dysphoria, irritability, emotional liability, depression, fatigue,  anxiety, depersonalization, myalgia, and arthralgia.<br\/><\/li><li><b>NYSTATIN <\/b><br\/>USES: Nystatin is a polyene antifungal agent used to treat candidal vulvovaginitis, candidiasis of skin, cutaneous and mucocutaneous infections, non-esophageal gastrointestinal candidiasis, and oropharyngeal candidiasis. PHARMACOLOGY: Nystatin binds to sterols in the fungal cell membrane, resulting in the cell membrane's inability to function as a selective barrier, thus allowing loss of essential cellular constituents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Patients given doses greater than 5 million units daily developed only nausea and gastrointestinal upset. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Toxicity from orally administered nystatin is extremely low.  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and oral irritation have been reported with oral nystatin therapy. RARE: Acute allergic reaction, tachycardia, bronchospasm, facial swelling, skin rash, urticaria, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and nonspecific myalgia have rarely been reported. Severe vulvovaginitis has been reported following intravaginal nystatin therapy.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"417403-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is not expected after overdose; gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Moderate to severely symptomatic patients and those with deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treated until symptoms resolve.
