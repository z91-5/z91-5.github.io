PHARMACOLOGY: Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxipurinol (alloxanthine), decrease the production of uric acid by inhibiting the action of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: In one case of massive acute overdose (22.5 grams), no adverse effects were noted. A woman died after ingesting a dose of 88 mg\/kg intermittently over the course of 22 days.  Leukopenia was observed. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Skin rash is the most common adverse effect in patients receiving allopurinol. Allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions manifest by varying kinds of skin rash in association with fever, chills, leukopenia or leukocytosis, eosinophilia, arthralgia, and pruritus. Cases of skin rash that can be severe and sometimes fatal have been reported following allopurinol use. In some cases, a skin rash may progress to severe hypersensitivity reactions such as exfoliative, urticarial, and purpuric lesions, as well as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (erythema multiforme exudativum), and\/or generalized vasculitis, irreversible hepatotoxicity, and, on rare occasions, death. The incidence of skin rash may be higher in the presence of renal insufficiency and\/or the concomitant use of ampicillin or amoxicillin. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking allopurinol. They are thought to be immune complex mediated and may include all or one of the following effects: DERMATOLOGIC: Mild maculopapular eruptions, exfoliative dermatitis, epidermal necrolysis, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome may develop.  These reactions often occur with fever, arthralgias, eosinophilia, hepatomegaly, renal dysfunction, or other signs of hypersensitivity. HEMATOLOGIC: Leukocytosis, leukopenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, and fatal bone marrow suppression (especially with concurrent administration of chemotherapeutic agents) have been reported. Rarely, mild reticulocytosis, lymphocytosis, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, decreased prothrombin levels and eosinophilic fibrohistiocytic bone marrow lesions have also occurred. HEPATIC: Elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, granulomatous hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatomegaly, and hyperbilirubinemia may be seen. RENAL: Deterioration of renal function due to interstitial nephritis or glomerular involvement may be more prevalent in patients with preexisting renal disease. OTHER: Alopecia, arteritis, peripheral neuritis, and macular eye lesions have been reported. OTHER REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, anorexia, peripheral neuropathy, headache, somnolence, aseptic meningitis, and cerebral vasculitis. Rhabdomyolysis suspected due to allopurinol has been reported in a single case. <br\/>"},{"id":"924986-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ALLOPURINOL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
