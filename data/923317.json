EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are common, but toxicity is rare and deaths have not been reported following single-substance exposures. PHARMACOLOGY: Angiotensin II is an endogenous peptide that binds to angiotensin receptors, causing vasoconstriction and stimulation of aldosterone release. Angiotensin receptor blockers are competitive antagonists at these receptors. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive antagonism of angiotensin receptors causes vasodilation and hypotension. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild hypotension and tachycardia, hypokalemia, asymptomatic hypoglycemia, muscle cramps and dizziness have been reported. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity has not been observed with these agents. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Common adverse effects include hypotension and dizziness.
