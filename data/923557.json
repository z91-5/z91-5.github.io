These actions occur more readily in normal tissue than in tumors because of the greater phosphatase activity, higher pH, and better vascularity in normal tissue , resulting in selective protection of normal tissues .<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"923557-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"923557-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Active metabolites: thiol metabolite and disulfide metabolite<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"923557-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Amifostine- Renal: 0.69%<\/li><li>Disulfide metabolite- Renal: 2.22%<\/li><li>Thiol metabolite- Renal: 2.64% <\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"923557-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 8 min <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"923557-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute amifostine powder with 9.7 mL sterile NS 0.9% to provide a concentration of 500 mg\/10 mL (single-use vial) or concentrations ranging from 5 mg\/mL to 40 mg\/mL (polyvinylchloride bags); administer within 5 hours if stored at room temperature and within 24 hours if stored under refrigeration<\/li><li>administer infusion to patient in supine position over 15 minutes starting 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy when used for the reduction of cumulative renal toxicity with chemotherapy; administer infusion over 3 minutes starting 15 to 30 minutes before standard fraction radiation therapy when use for reduction of moderate to severe xerostomia from radiation of the head and neck<\/li><li>interrupt therapy if systolic blood pressure decreases significantly from baseline (baseline value, decrease): less than 100, 20; 100 to 119, 25; 120 to 139, 30; 140 to 179, 40; greater than or equal to 180, 50; if patient is asymptomatic and returns to normal within 5 minutes, restart infusion so that full dose may be given; if full dose cannot be given, dose at 740 mg\/m(2) for subsequent chemotherapy cycles<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"923557-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>normal renal function is indicative of efficacy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer<\/li><li>reduction in symptoms of xerostomia in patients undergoing radiation for head and neck cancer is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>blood pressure; prior to therapy initiation, at 5 minute intervals during long infusions, immediately after infusions lasting less than 5 minutes, and as clinically indicated; closely monitor patients whose antihypertensive treatment was interrupted for amifostine therapy<\/li><li>cutaneous reactions (rash involving lips, erythematous, edematous, or bullous lesions of palms of hands or soles of feet, trunk involvement, cutaneous reaction associated with fever or other constitutional symptoms, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, toxoderma, and exfoliative dermatitis); monitor prior to, during, immediately after, and weeks following amifostine therapy, especially when used as a chemoprotectant; requires permanent discontinuation of therapy if serious or severe cutaneous reactions or mucosal lesions do not have other etiologies, or occur outside the injection site or radiation port, or include erythematous, edematous, or bullous lesions of palms of hands or soles of feet<\/li><li>hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis may occur<\/li><li>fluid balance; when coadministered with highly emetogenic chemotherapy<\/li><li>serum calcium in patients at risk of hypocalcemia (eg, nephrotic syndrome, multiple amifostine doses)<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"923557-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 500 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Ethyol<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 500 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"923557-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"923557-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>AMIFOSTINE<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: No human data.
