Its mechanism of action has not been well-defined .<\/li><li>Propofol's hemodynamic effects are generally more pronounced than those of other intravenous anesthetic agents . Arterial hypotension, with readings decreased by as much as 30% or more , has been reported, possibly due to inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity . Hypotensive effects are generally proportional to dose and rate of administration of propofol , and may be potentiated by opioid analgesics . Endotracheal intubation and surgical stimulation may increase arterial pressure ; increases in heart rate and\/or blood pressure to greater than baseline values, which occur frequently with other agents, are not as significant with propofol, possibly due to central sympatholytic and\/or vagotonic effects . Propofol may also decrease systemic vascular resistance , myocardial blood flow, and oxygen consumption . The mechanism of these effects may involve direct vasodilation   and negative inotropy . Effects such as decreased stroke volume and cardiac output have been demonstrated in some studies .<\/li><li>Propofol is a respiratory depressant, frequently producing apnea that may persist for longer than 60 seconds , depending on factors such as premedication , rate of administration , dose administered , and presence of hyperventilation or hyperoxia . In addition, propofol may produce significant decreases in respiratory rate , minute volume , tidal volume , mean inspiratory flow rate , and functional residual capacity . These respiratory depressant effects may be the result of depression of the central inspiratory drive as opposed to a change in central timing . The ventilatory depressant effects of propofol may be counteracted by painful surgical stimulation .<\/li><li>Propofol decreases cerebral blood flow , cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption , and intracranial pressure , and increases cerebrovascular resistance . It does not appear to affect cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension .<\/li><li>Preliminary findings suggest that in patients with normal intraocular pressure, propofol decreases intraocular pressure   by as much as 30 to 50% . This decrease may be associated with a concomitant decrease in systemic vascular resistance .<\/li><li>Clinical studies have shown that propofol does not cause significant signs of histamine release   or significant increases in plasma immunoglobulin or complement C 3 levels . Respiratory resistance after tracheal intubation is lower when propofol is used for induction of anesthesia than when thiopental or high-dose etomidate is used for induction of anesthesia .<\/li><li>Although propofol has the potential for affecting adrenal steroidogenesis , it does not appear to block cortisol and aldosterone secretion in response to surgical stress or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in clinical practice . Although transient decreases in plasma cortisol concentrations have occurred, these reductions have not been sustained .<\/li><li>Propofol appears to have no analgesic activity . In addition, animal studies have demonstrated no significant effect on coagulation profiles .<\/li><li>Limited experience with propofol in susceptible patients and animal studies has not demonstrated a propensity to induce malignant hyperthermia .<\/li><li>Propofol has antiemetic properties .

It also has several off-label uses including: conscious sedation, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and refractory status epilepticus and delirium tremens. There has also been documented recreational use, mostly involving medical professionals. PHARMACOLOGY: Its mechanism of action is not well-defined, but it is thought to decrease the excitatory effects of glutamate. TOXICOLOGY: Its toxic effects are secondary to its action as a general anesthetic. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Significant toxicity is extremely rare, with case reports of death usually secondary to illicit use. OVERDOSE: Propofol toxicity only occurs following IV injection. Overdose produces unconsciousness, respiratory depression and may cause hypotension and cardiovascular toxicity. ADVERSE EFFECTS: A \"propofol infusion syndrome\" has been described in patients receiving prolonged propofol sedation in the intensive care setting. This syndrome is characterized by metabolic acidosis, bradydysrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, dyslipidemia, acute renal failure, massive ketonuria, elevated transaminases, fatty liver, myocardial failure and death. While most cases have involved children, it has been reported in adults as well. OTHER: Other significant adverse reactions include hypotension, increased movement, local injection site burning, stinging, or pain and apnea. More rarely, there have been reports of hypertension in children, dysrhythmias, bradycardia, decreased cardiac output (especially with concurrent opioid use), tachycardia, pruritus, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, and respiratory acidosis during weaning. RARE: Very rarely there are reports of events by the following individual organ systems: CARDIAC: Cardiac arrest, asystole, syncope, dysrhythmias (ie, atrial and ventricular premature contractions); NEURO: postoperative unconsciousness, somnolence, delirium, dizziness, anticholinergic syndrome, agitation, hypertonia, and myoclonia; IMMUNE: anaphylaxis\/anaphylactoid reaction, laryngospasm; RESPIRATORY: decreased lung function, hypoxia, cough, pulmonary edema, wheezing; GASTROINTESTINAL: nausea, pancreatitis, hypersalivation; MUSCULOSKELETAL: myalgia, rhabdomyolysis; EYE: vision abnormalities (ie, amblyopia); GENITOURINARY: discoloration of urine (green); DERMAL: extravasation, phlebitis, discolored hair and nailbeds (green); GENERAL: fever, flushing, chills, extremity pain, hypomagnesemia. <br\/>"},{"id":"488560-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PROPOFOL AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Stop propofol administration and provide good supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: The mainstay of treatment is propofol cessation and to provide good supportive care. Assisted ventilation is likely to be necessary, orotracheal intubation may be required. Initially, treat hypotension with intravenous fluids, add vasopressors if unresponsive to fluids. To reduce the incidence of &quot;propofol infusion syndrome&quot; some recommendation have included limiting propofol administration to only a few days and to closely monitor patients for alterations in creatine kinase and ECG abnormalities. For hypertriglyceridemia, some recommendations include monitoring serum triglycerides after continuous therapy for greater than 48 hours with doses exceeding 50 mcg\/kg\/minute, and to use an alternative sedative agent if significant hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 500 mg\/dL) develops due to the risk of developing pancreatitis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: There is no role for GI decontamination as propofol toxicity only occurs during parenteral administration. For dermal or eye exposure, decontaminate the site via irrigation. HOSPITAL: There is no role for GI decontamination as propofol toxicity only occurs during parenteral administration.<\/li><li>Airway management: For patients with mild sedation, open the airway and assist ventilation; propofol has a short duration of action so this may be all that is necessary. If respiratory depression persists orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation will be necessary.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for propofol.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Propofol is highly protein bound (99%) in the body and has a large volume of distribution, hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not useful.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Though blood concentrations of propofol can be obtained, they are not widely available or clinically useful. In patients undergoing sedation, institute continuous cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry and end tidal CO2 monitoring. If &quot;propofol infusion syndrome&quot; is suspected, or if administration has been prolonged, monitor serum electrolytes, renal function tests, liver enzymes, creatine kinase, serum triglycerides and ECG. An echocardiogram may be useful to evaluate myocardial function. Monitor urinalysis for ketonuria after prolonged and\/or significant exposure; urine may appear discolored (ie, rusty, olive green, tea-colored).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients should not have home access to propofol; thus, all potential exposures should be sent to a health care facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients should be observed until all symptoms resolve (ie, the patient is awake and alert). ADMISSION CRITERIA: All patients administered propofol should be an intensive care setting or the equivalent. The vast majority of patients receiving propofol are in an Emergency Department, Operating Room\/PACU, or Intensive Care Unit secondary to other comorbidities. Criteria or discharge secondary to the use of propofol primarily relies on the patient's mental status (ie, awake and alert), but may chiefly rely on their underlying medical issues. CONSULT CRITERIA: A poison center\/toxicologist should be contacted for patients with severe toxicity. Other potential consultants is dependent on the patient's symptoms.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"488560-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PROPOFOL AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Adverse reactions to propofol including bradycardia, hypotension, fever, dysrhythmias, somnolence, hepatotoxicity and seizures have occurred during therapeutic use.
