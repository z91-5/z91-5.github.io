PHARMACOLOGY: The exact mechanism of action has not been established; however, pimozide blocks dopamine receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). The efficacy of pimozide in suppressing the tics of Tourette's syndrome is thought to be due to dopaminergic blockade. Secondary changes in central dopamine function and metabolism, including increased brain turnover of dopamine, may contribute to both the therapeutic and the adverse effects of pimozide. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Extrapyramidal effects (muscle stiffness, perioral dyskinesia, tremors), hypotension, and cardiac dysrhythmias, including QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes may occur following an overdose. Severe overdoses may result in a comatose state with respiratory depression. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects following pimozide include hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias, including QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes, extrapyramidal effects, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, diarrhea, constipation, sedation, facial swelling, seizures, amenorrhea, galactorrhea, xerostomia, dysphoria, lethargy, and depression. DRUG INTERACTION: CYP 2D6 AND CYP 3A4 INHIBITORS: Pimozide is metabolized by CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4. The concurrent administration of pimozide and strong CYP 2D6 or CYP 3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated due to the possibility of significantly increased pimozide plasma concentrations resulting in a dangerous risk of pimozide toxicity. <br\/>"},{"id":"467818-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PIMOZIDE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluid. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Therapeutic doses of pimozide may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of pimozide and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities, overdrive pacing may be necessary. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias using ACLS protocols. Manage dystonic reactions with anticholinergic agents.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression or persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, CNS or respiratory depression, or persistent seizures.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Prolonged QT interval: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs in all symptomatic patients or following significant exposures; prolonged QT interval has developed with therapy and in overdose.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion.

Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs, considering the long half-life of pimozide. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged.

However, acute ingestion of 60 mg in a 2.5-year-old child produced only mild effects. Ingestion of 100 mg in a 17-year-old girl also did not produce serious problems.
