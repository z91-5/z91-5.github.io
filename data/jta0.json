It is glycolate and oxalate that are primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and renal damage that are seen in ethylene glycol poisoning.  Methanol is first metabolized to formaldehyde and then undergoes subsequent oxidation via formaldehyde dehydrogenase to become formic acid. It is formic acid that is primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and visual disturbances that are associated with methanol poisoning.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jta0s8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"jta0s8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd:  0.6 to 1.02 L\/kg <br\/>"},"2":{"id":"jta0s8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic: Primary metabolite: 4-carboxypyrazole 80 to 85% of dose; Other metabolites: 4-hydroxymethylpyrazole and the N-glucuronide conjugates of 4-carboxypyrazole and 4-hydroxymethylpyrazole.<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"jta0s8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Renal: 1 to 3.5% unchanged <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"jta0s8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: Varies with dose <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"jta0s9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>dilute in 100 mL of NS or D5W<\/li><li>administer by slow IV infusion over 30 minutes<\/li><li>stable for 24 hours after dilution<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jta0s10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>ethylene glycol poisoning: serum and urine ethylene glycol concentrations<\/li><li>methanol poisoning: serum methanol concentrations<\/li><li> urinary oxalate, plasma\/urinary osmolality, renal\/hepatic function, serum electrolytes, arterial blood gases, white blood cell counts, ECG, and EEG (in comatose patients)<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jta0s11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 1 GM\/ML<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"jta0s12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"jta0s12b31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>FOMEPIZOLE<\/b><br\/>USES: Fomepizole is an antidote primarily used for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning. PHARMACOLOGY: Fomepizole has been shown to block alcohol dehydrogenase activity, preventing the metabolism of toxic byproducts from ethylene glycol (glycolate and oxalate) and methanol (formic acid). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose from the use of fomepizole is rare. TOXICITY: At the time of this review, no reports of inadvertent overdose with fomepizole have been published. In healthy volunteers receiving 50 and 100 mg\/kg doses (3 to 6 times the recommended dose) of fomepizole, nausea, dizziness, and vertigo were reported.  In most individuals, the effects were short-term. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Headache, nausea, dizziness, increased drowsiness, and metallic taste. LESS COMMON: Skin irritation at the site of administration, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypotension, rash, feeling drunk, anxiety, mild elevation of liver enzymes, seizures, vision\/speech disturbance, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and anemia. <br\/>"},{"id":"jta0s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FOMEPIZOLE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
