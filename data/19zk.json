In industry it is used as a lubricant, as a pigment in paints, and in manufacturing of cellophane, photographic papers, brake linings and adhesives. PHARMACOLOGY: Barium is used in radiologic procedures because it is radiopaque. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is very rare, exposure rarely causes significant adverse effects. TOXICITY: Barium sulfate is insoluble and not absorbed. Acute toxicity does not develop. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Constipation, impaction, obstruction, cramping, diarrhea, and rarely, appendicitis, bowel perforation, and peritonitis can occur. ECG abnormalities have been reported. Aspiration can cause pneumonitis, granulomas, and transient dyspnea and hypoxia. Venous intravasation can cause pulmonary emboli. <br\/>"},{"id":"19zks12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BARIUM SULFATE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Significant toxicity is not expected after ingestion, treatment is supportive. Treat mild allergic reactions with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Administer inhaled beta agonists and epinephrine for more severe reactions. Patients with aspiration may need bronchoscopy.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Barium sulfate is not absorbed, GI decontamination is not necessary. Irrigate exposed eyes with water.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory studies are needed in most patients. Patients who aspirate barium or inhale barium dust should be followed with chest radiographs and pulmonary function testing.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for hemodialysis or hemoperfusion.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with inadvertent ingestions can be managed at home. Patients with deliberate ingestions should be sent to a medical facility for psychiatric evaluation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant aspiration, intravenous injection or peritoneal contamination with barium should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a surgeon for any patient with suspected barium leakage into the peritoneum.
