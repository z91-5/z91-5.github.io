PHARMACOLOGY: Broad-spectrum bactericidal agents that act by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Limited data. Overdose is rare and rarely causes significant toxicity. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Diarrhea and transient dizziness were reported in an adult patient following inadvertent administration of 3 ertapenem doses of 1 g each in a 24-hour period. Nausea and vomiting are also possible SEVERE TOXICITY: Based on limited data, severe toxicity has not been reported following overdose.

If overdose occurs in a patient receiving outpatient antibiotic infusion, mild to moderately symptomatic patients should be sent to health care facility for evaluation and treated until symptoms resolve.
