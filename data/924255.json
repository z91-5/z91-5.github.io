PHARMACOLOGY: Bisphosphonates have a high affinity for mineralized bone and inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption resulting in a net gain in bone mass. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose of this medication is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate toxicity of bisphosphonates have resulted in hypocalcemia, paresthesia, hypotension, fever, and vomiting. SEVERE TOXICITY: Acute renal failure and death have been reported following high dose administration of tiludronate (800 mg\/day IV for 2 days). ADVERSE EFFECTS: Dose-dependent upper gastrointestinal irritation (ie, esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, erosions, and dysphagia) is common. Asymptomatic decreases in calcium and phosphate may develop. Headache, musculoskeletal pain, and osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported.
