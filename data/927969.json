Thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin. Fibrin is stabilized in the presence of calcium ions and by activated Factor XIII. Factor XIIIa induces cross-linking of fibrin polymers which result in the fibrin clot being more elastic and more resistant to fibrinolysis. The cross-linked fibrin is the end result of the coagulation cascade.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"927969-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"927969-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: 52.7 mL\/kg <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"927969-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>16 years of age and older: 78.7 hr<\/li><li>less than 16 years of age: 69.9 hr<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"927969-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute with 50 mL Sterile Water for Injection; gently swirl but do not shake vial<\/li><li>reconstituted fibrinogen is stable for 24 hours at 20 to 25 degrees C<\/li><li>administer through a separate injection site and do not mix with other medications or solutions<\/li><li>administer within 24 hours of reconstitution by slow intravenous injection at a rate not exceeding 5 mL\/min<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"927969-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>fibrinogen level, with a target level of 100 mg\/dL maintained until hemostasis is achieved<\/li><li>decreased bleeding and adequate hemostasis<\/li><li>white blood cell count to screen for potential infections<\/li><li>early signs of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions and discontinue therapy if necessary<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of thrombosis which may occur with therapy<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of infection, including hepatitis<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"927969-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>RiaSTAP<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 1 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"927969-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Despite screening and testing, human plasma products carry a remote risk of transmitting infectious agents.
