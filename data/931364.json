When the components are ingested, the citric acid powder acidifies the stomach and delays transfer of the solution to the duodenum. This allows any present Helicobacter pylori organisms to decompose the 13C urea into 13C-labeled carbon dioxide and ammonia. The BreathID(TM) Hp device is then used to measure the amount of exhaled 13C-labeled carbon dioxide.<br\/>"},"9":{"id":"931364-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Dissolve 75 mg tablet of 13C urea plus 4.3 g citric acid powder in 150 to 200 mL of tap water in a cup with at least a 236 mL (8 ounce) capacity; stir thoroughly with provided straw until completely dissolved; tiny particles may remain after mixing; if larger particles are present after 5 minutes of mixing, discard solution<\/li><li>Administer within 2 hours of preparation and drink the entire amount through a straw within 2 minutes<\/li><li>Administer only when prompted by device screen to ensure proper baseline sample has been completed<\/li><li>Perform post-treatment monitoring after at least 4 weeks of treatment to prevent false results<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"931364-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"No specific monitoring has been determined.<br\/>"}}}
