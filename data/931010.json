It is also used in combination with other agents as an abuse deterrent. PHARMACOLOGY: Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that competes with and displaces narcotics at opioid receptor sites. TOXICOLOGY: The antagonistic effects of naloxone at opioid receptors may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose of naloxone is rare. It is used commonly in a variety of settings including prehospital care settings, emergency departments, and operating rooms. OVERDOSE: Naloxone is not a drug of abuse and there is essentially no overdose phenomenon. Increased blood pressure may occur following overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The adverse effects of naloxone are related to its antagonistic effects to narcotics and the resulting withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms include pain, hypertension, diaphoresis, piloerection, muscle cramping, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and agitation. Pulmonary edema and dysrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in association with the use of naloxone. There have also been reports of acute lung injury, seizures, dysphagia, urinary urgency, and increases of cortisol and growth hormone. NEONATES: In neonates, withdrawal symptoms also include excessive crying, hyperactive reflexes, and convulsions.<br\/><\/li><li><b>OXYCODONE  <\/b><br\/>USES: Oxycodone is primarily used for the treatment of pain. Oxycodone is commonly abused for euphoric effects by multiple routes (i.e., injection, insufflation, smoking, ingestion). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is common, particularly in patients with chronic opioid abuse, and may be life threatening. PHARMACOLOGY: Oxycodone binds at the opiate receptors. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting and pinpoint pupils. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE POISONING: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, prolonged QT, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia. Death may result from any of these complications.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931010-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>NALOXONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treatment of mild to moderate withdrawal induced by naloxone includes the use of benzodiazepines for agitation and antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. Because naloxone has a short duration of action compared with most opioids, no further treatment is generally needed. In mild cases, symptoms usually subside within 1 to 2 hours. Clonidine has also been used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine has been used to treat diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include benzodiazepines for agitation and antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. Because naloxone has a short duration of action compared with most opioids, no further treatment is generally needed. In mild cases, symptoms usually subside within 1 to 2 hours. Clonidine has also been used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine to treat diarrhea. If pulmonary edema develops, oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure, or endotracheal intubation may be required. Seizures should be treated with standard antiepileptic agents such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route. HOSPITAL: Because naloxone is not active orally, gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation. Provide bilevel positive airway pressure as required and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with pulmonary edema or serious toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension does not usually require treatment. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside or phentolamine are preferred, with nitroglycerin or labetalol as alternatives.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No laboratory studies are needed after naloxone use or overdose unless otherwise clinically indicated. Naloxone concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful. Monitor respiratory and mental status when naloxone is used to reverse opioid toxicity.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Naloxone exposures in general should be very safe. Asymptomatic patients may remain at home with inadvertent exposures to naloxone alone. However, if naloxone was administered to reverse opioid toxicity, the patient should be brought in to a health care facility for further evaluation. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who are symptomatic, those with deliberate overdose, and patients in whom naloxone was used to reverse opioid toxicity should be referred to a health care facility for evaluation and observation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with pulmonary edema or those who are persistently symptomatic should be admitted. Admission is almost never necessary. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a toxicologist or a poison center for advice if there are concerns.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>OXYCODONE  <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is generally not indicated because of the risk of CNS depression and aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence, incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed. A CONTINUOUS infusion is likely to be necessary after a controlled-release oxycodone ingestion. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1 to 2 hours. Oxycodone has a much longer duration of effect, so it is necessary to observe the patient at least 4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then add adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure if hypotension persists.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Oxycodone plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Obtain a baseline acetaminophen and salicylate levels in a patient with a suspected overdose, as oxycodone is often present in combination products. Routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of opioid toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid-naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid-naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA:  Patients with deliberate ingestions, adults with symptoms or ingestions of more than the therapeutic dose, or a pediatric ingestion should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Monitor for at least 4 to 6 hours. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. CONTROLLED RELEASE: Patients ingesting controlled-release preparations should be observed for at least 12 hours and admitted if symptoms develop (Tmax is 4.2 to 5.1 hours at a therapeutic dose and the drug can continue to be released from the controlled release preparation for 24 to 48 hours; effects may be delayed and prolonged). ADMISSION CRITERIA: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Those with significant, persistent central nervous system depression should be admitted to the hospital. A patient needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as a controlled-release formulation has likely been taken; additional doses may be needed. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, and those needing a naloxone infusion or who are intubated should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONTROLLED RELEASE: Patients with even mild to moderate opioid effects, and those who require naloxone after ingestion of a controlled-release formulation should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear. Refer patients for substance abuse counseling if indicated.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931010-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>NALOXONE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: There is no specific known toxic dose with naloxone, though deaths have occurred in varying doses associated with its use. However, these case reports do not provide any direct evidence that the use of naloxone was solely responsible for mortality. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT: Standard dosing in adults may range widely, as the drug should be titrated to effect. Initial IV doses usually range from 0.1 to 2 mg, which may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes. Additional doses may be needed every 20 to 60 minutes. Atypical opioids (eg, fentanyl, propoxyphene) or massive opioid overdoses may require much larger doses to reverse respiratory depression. In addition, to avoid precipitating acute withdrawal lower doses should be titrated incrementally in opioid-dependent patients. Continuous infusion of naloxone has also been used for respiratory depression with one suggestion of using 2\/3 of the initial effective naloxone bolus per hour with titrations to effect. INTRANASAL: Intranasal dosing is usually 2 mg (1mg\/nostril) with repeat dosing every 5 minutes if respiratory depression continues. PEDIATRIC\/PALS GUIDELINES: Pediatric dosing is initially 0.1 mg\/kg to a maximum of 2 mg and repeated every 2 to 5 minutes as needed. ALTERNATIVE DOSING: In cases of known or suspected chronic opioid therapy, a lower dose of 0.01 mg\/kg may be considered and titrated to effect to avoid withdrawal.<br\/><\/li><li><b>OXYCODONE<\/b><br\/>A toxic dose can vary widely depending on the opioid tolerance of the exposed individual.
