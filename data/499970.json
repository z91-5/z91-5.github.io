anti-arrhythmic. In the treatment of malaria, quinidine acts as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide and is gametocidal to Plasmodium vivax and P malaria, but not to P falciparum. Within cardiac muscle and Purkinje fibers, quinidine depresses the inward depolarizing sodium current, thereby resulting in slowed conduction and reduced automaticity while increasing effective refractory period in the atria, ventricles, and Purkinje fibers. Quinidine can prevent or interrupt reentrant arrhythmias and arrhythmias caused by increased automaticity, including atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia by slowing cardiac conduction and prolonging the effective refractory period. Quinidine causes a dose-related QT interval prolongation, which may lead to increased ventricular automaticity and polymorphic ventricular tachycardias.<\/li><li>Quinidine also displays anticholinergic, alpha-adrenergic antagonist and negative inotropic activity.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"499970-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"499970-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Tmax, Oral, immediate-release tablet: approximately 2 hours<\/li><li>Tmax, Oral, extended-release tablet: approximately 6 hours<\/li><li>Bioavailability, Oral, approximately 70%<\/li><li>Effect of food, Immediate-release tablet: delayed by nearly 1 hour; extent of absorption unchanged<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"499970-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Protein binding, (adults and older children) 80% to 88% to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and albumin; infants, neonates, and in pregnancy, lower<\/li><li>Vd, 2 to 3 L\/kg; cirrhosis, 3 to 5 L\/kg; congestive heart failure, as low as 0.5 L\/kg<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"499970-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Liver: extensive via CYP3A4<\/li><li>3-hydroxyquinidine: active<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"499970-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 5% to 20% unchanged<\/li><li>Feces: approximately 1% to 3%.<\/li><li>Renal clearance: approximately 1 mL\/min\/kg<\/li><li>Dialyzable: Yes (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis)<\/li><li>Total body clearance: adults, 3 to 5 mL\/min\/kg; pediatrics, increased 2 to 3-fold as adult<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"499970-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Adults, 6 to 8 hours<\/li><li>Cirrhosis, increased<\/li><li>Pediatrics, 2 to 4 hours<\/li><li>3-hydroxyquinidine: 12 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}]},{"id":"499970-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>(extended-release tablets) do not crush<br\/>"},{"id":"499970-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>serum quinidine therapeutic concentration range is 2 to 6 mg\/L (6.2 to 18.5 mmol\/L)<\/li><li>cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter: restoration of sinus rhythm indicates efficacy<\/li><li>chronic therapy to reduce recurrence of atrial fibrillation and flutter: prevention of atrial fibrillation\/flutter relapse or an increase in average time between episodes may indicate efficacy<\/li><li>life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias: suppression of ventricular arrhythmias, as measured by programmed electrical stimulation and\/or Holter monitoring with exercise, and improvement in associated symptoms, including mortality, indicates clinical efficacy<\/li><li>malaria: absence or reduction of parasites in the blood and\/or symptomatic improvement may indicate efficacy<\/li><li>ECG at baseline and while on therapy, particularly with dose increases<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"499970-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Tablet: 200 MG, 300 MG<\/li><li>Oral Tablet, Extended Release: 300 MG<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"499970-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"499970-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>QUINIDINE<\/b><br\/>USES: Quinidine is a type of la antiarrhythmic agent. It is used for suppression of supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias. PHARMACOLOGY: Quinidine depresses the fast sodium-dependent channel, showing phase zero of the cardiac action potential. TOXICOLOGY: At high concentrations, this may result in myocardial depression resulting in severe depression of cardiac conduction velocity and delayed repolarization resulting in prolongation of the QT interval, which may be associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Quinidine also has anticholinergic activity and alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Quinidine ingestion is an uncommon cause of poisoning. Ingestions are usually unintentional, but because quinidine has a low toxic to therapeutic ratio, manifestations can be severe. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may develop after an acute ingestion. Dry mouth, dilated pupils and delirium may occur secondary to anticholinergic effects. Chronic ingestion may be associated with cinchonism (ie, tinnitus, vertigo, deafness, headache, or visual disturbances).  SEVERE TOXICITY: Various cardiotoxic effects may occur including sinus bradycardia, arrest or asystole, PR, QRS or QT interval prolongation, sinus tachycardia, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, depressed myocardial contractility. Alpha adrenergic blockade may result in hypotension and pulmonary edema. ADVERSE EFFECTS: GI upset and neurologic complaints predominate. <br\/>"},{"id":"499970-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>QUINIDINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Monitor minimally symptomatic patients for a minimum of 6 hours and admit symptomatic patients until ECG normalizes and clinical symptoms resolve. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Support respiratory and cardiovascular function as needed. Treat hypotension with fluids and pressors. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines. Treat wide QRS with sodium bicarbonate 1 to 2 mEq\/kg by rapid IV bolus, may be repeated as needed. Treat recurrent ventricular tachycardia with lidocaine, phenytoin, or overdrive pacing. Do not use other la or lc agents as they may worsen toxicity. Consider pacemaker insertion for high degree AV block. Intravenous fat emulsion therapy should be considered in patients with refractory cardiac toxicity. Cardiac bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered for patients with severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Decontamination: SUMMARY: Usually no decontamination is needed. PREHOSPITAL: Generally no decontamination is needed in the prehospital setting. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be utilized for significant ingestions. Gastric lavage may also be utilized if the patient's airway is protected and the patient presents soon after a potentially life-threatening ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation may be necessary in patients who develop hemodynamic instability.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: At high concentrations, quinidine may result in myocardial depression resulting in severe depression or cardiac conduction velocity and delayed repolarization resulting in prolongation of the QT interval, which may be associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, atrial overdrive pacing may be necessary.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULT: 1 to 2 g IV (mixed in 50 to 100 mL D5W) infused over 5 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILD: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Rates of 100 to 120 beats\/min may terminate torsades. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Fat Emulsion: LIPID EMULSION: Quinidine is lipid soluble. While there are no reports of IV lipid therapy to treat quinidine toxicity, it should be considered in patients who develop significant cardiovascular toxicity with hemodynamic compromise. Administer 1.5 mL\/kg of 20% lipid emulsion as an IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min for 30 to 60 minutes. For declining blood pressure, increase the infusion rate to 0.5 mL\/kg\/min and continue infusion for 60 minutes. Repeat bolus 1 to 2 times if there is no evidence of clinical improvement.<\/li><li>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or cardiopulmonary bypass may provide circulatory support that allows metabolism and elimination of quinidine in patients with hemodynamic instability or severe dysrhythmias.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs. ECG interval monitoring is by far the most important indicator of toxicity and should be followed very closely. Monitor serum electrolytes, glucose and renal function. In patients with significant toxicity or receiving sodium bicarbonate therapy, monitor arterial blood gases. Serum concentrations may be available (therapeutic range: 1 to 4 mcg\/mL). Consider checking acetaminophen or aspirin concentrations if there is any uncertainty of the drug ingested.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Because of its large volume of distribution and significant protein binding, hemodialysis or other forms of enhanced elimination are not expected to be of benefit.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with an unintentional ingestion of an extra dose may be observed at home if asymptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions, and those with ingestions of more than an extra dose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. Patients who remain asymptomatic for 6 hours after ingestion of an immediate release formulation may be discharged. Patients who have ingested overdoses of sustained release formulations should be observed for 12 to 24 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients requiring ongoing supportive care need admission. Once asymptomatic for 6 hours, they may be discharged. CONSULT CRITERIA: In cases of severe poisoning consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for guidance.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"499970-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>QUINIDINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: INGESTION: ADULT: Ingestion of 1 g is expected to cause symptoms in an adult.
