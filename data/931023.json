Suvorexant is a Schedule IV controlled substance. PHARMACOLOGY: Neuropeptides orexin A and B promote wakefulness by acting on orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R. Suvorexant is a highly selective antagonist for orexin receptors, thereby exerting pharmacologic activity by blocking OX1R and OX2R receptors that are thought to suppress wake drive. Suvorexant exposure appears to increase in a non-dose proportional manner over the range of 10 to 80 mg because of a decrease in absorption at higher doses. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose information is limited. In clinical trials, volunteers administered morning doses of up to 240 mg of suvorexant developed dose-dependent increases in the frequency and duration of somnolence. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic use. ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: Somnolence was the most common adverse event. At doses of 15 or 20 mg, somnolence was more likely to occur in females compared to males. Women were also twice as likely as men to experience the following adverse events: headache, dry mouth, abnormal dreams, cough and upper respiratory tract infections. OTHER: Dizziness and diarrhea have also been reported. SERIOUS EVENTS: The CNS depressant effects of suvorexant may impair daytime wakefulness, driving skills and may increase the risk of falling asleep while driving. Coadministration with other CNS depressants (eg, benzodiazepines, opioids, alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants) can increase the risk of CNS depression. Abnormal thinking and behavioral changes (eg, amnesia, anxiety, hallucinations) have developed in patients using hypnotics like suvorexant. In clinical studies, a dose-dependent increase in suicidal ideation has been self-reported in patients receiving suvorexant. Sleep paralysis, hypnagogic\/hypnopompic hallucinations, and a cataplexy-like syndrome may occur in patients prescribed suvorexant. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Concurrent use of suvorexant with strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and conivaptan) is not recommended because it can increase exposure to suvorexant and increase the risk of adverse events. In patients taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors (eg, amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, imatinib and verapamil), suvorexant should be reduced to 5 mg daily; the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily, if needed. Concurrent administration of suvorexant with alcohol can produce an additive effect on psychomotor impairment. <br\/>"},{"id":"931023-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SUVOREXANT<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor mental status and vital signs. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea.  MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor mental status and vital signs. Assess airway, monitor pulse oximetry, and ensure adequate ventilation in patients with a severe intoxication or a mixed ingestion (ie, other CNS depressants, alcohol).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and loss of airway protection.  HOSPITAL: In general, decontamination is not indicated following a minor exposure, but may be considered for a large overdose that presents early. Consider activated charcoal following a recent significant exposure; administer activated charcoal if the patient is awake and cooperative, not vomiting and the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Monitor CNS and respiratory function. Assess airway and monitor pulse oximetry following a significant exposure. Although not anticipated to be necessary following a minor or moderate exposure, ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation in patients with severe intoxication (ie, profound somnolence, coma, respiratory depression).<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vitals signs and mental status. Routine laboratory studies are not needed unless otherwise clinically indicated. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.

Other causes of CNS depression (eg, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol) should be ruled out if the diagnosis is not clear or the patient presents with severe intoxication.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Suvorexant is highly protein bound (greater than 99%) and has a volume of distribution of approximately 49 L; therefore, hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic adult (other than mild drowsiness) with an inadvertent ingestion of 1 to 2 extra doses may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate ingestions and symptomatic patients should be sent to a health care facility for observation for at least 12 to 18 hours and\/or until clinically improved. Children with an unintentional ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant, persistent central nervous system toxicity should be admitted. Patients with coma or respiratory depression should be admitted to an intensive care setting.
