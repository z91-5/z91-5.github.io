Common pyrethroids include permethrin which is available to treat head and body lice. PHARMACOLOGY: Pyrethroids act directly on insect nerve axons, they bind to open sodium channels and markedly prolong axonal sodium channel depolarization, causing a prolonged sodium current to flow which leads to hyperexcitation of the nervous system. Delayed repolarization and paralysis of the pests consequentially occurs. Pyrethroids have a much lower toxic effect in mammals than in insects. They are powerful paralytic poisons in insects, causing \"quick knockdown\" and in sufficient dosage, death. These agents are active against a broad range of pests, including lice, ticks, fleas, mites, and other arthropods. TOXICOLOGY: Paresthesia caused by pyrethroids is a result of a direct dermal effect on intracutaneous nerve endings at very low doses. It is thought to be secondary to repetitive firing in peripheral skin nerves. Pyrethroids are divided into two types based on their structures and clinical manifestation in overdose. Most type I pyrethroids (eg, permethrin, allethrin, biuallethine, cismethrin, permethrin, phenothrin, resmethrin, tetramethrin) do not contain a cyano group while type II pyrethroids (eg, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenpropathrin, fenvalerate) do. These classes are not absolute as some pyrethroids exhibit intermediate properties. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures to pyrethroids are common but significant toxicity is rare and usually due to allergic reactions. OVERDOSE: Type II pyrethroids are generally more toxic than type I pyrethroids. Type I pyrethroid poisoning include severe fine tremor, marked reflex hyperexcitability, sympathetic activation, paresthesia (dermal exposure), and hyperthermia. Some authors describe Type I pyrethroid poisoning as a \"T-syndrome\" (coarse tremors). Systemic effects of Type II poisoning include profuse watery salivation, coarse tremor, sympathetic activation, increased extensor tone, moderate reflex hyperexcitability, seizures, choreoathetosis, paresthesia (dermal exposure), pulmonary edema, hyperglycemia, and coma. Type II pyrethroid poisoning is sometimes referred to as a \"CS-syndrome\" (choreoathetosis or clonic seizures and salivation). Intermediate pyrethroids (fenpropathrin, cyphenothrin) which possess properties of both type I and type II pyrethroids may cause tremors with profuse salivation, a combination of T and CS syndromes. INHALATION EXPOSURE: Headache, dizziness, burning or itching of the face, airway irritation, rhinitis, sneezing, pulmonary edema, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by pneumonitis, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, chest pain, and bronchospasm. Rare cases of respiratory paralysis and cardiopulmonary arrest have been reported. OCULAR EXPOSURE: Eye irritation, burning, itching, corneal damage, periorbital edema. INGESTION EXPOSURE: Burning sensation in the mouth, laryngitis, pharyngitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, gastritis, paresthesias, headache, dizziness, hyperexcitability, seizures, and coma. Large ingestions can cause abdominal pain and vomiting followed by coma and seizures within 20 to 60 minutes. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: Allergic dermatitis, alopecia, facial dysesthesias, personality changes, sensomotor polyneuropathy, memory and concentration deficits. In cases of ingestion or inhalation of pyrethroid emulsions, it should be noted that excipients such as xylene and surfactants may contribute to toxicity, particularly dysesthesias. Xylene is also a CNS depressant, which may contribute to impaired consciousness with ingestion. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common adverse effects are mucous membrane, dermal or ocular irritation. Exposure may trigger bronchospasm in asthmatics. <br\/>"},{"id":"457740-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PYRETHROIDS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: TREATMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. TREATMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Administer neuromuscular blocking agents with continuous EEG monitoring in refractory patients to avoid hyperthermia and muscle destruction. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended due to the potential for rapid onset of seizures and CNS depression after substantial ingestion. Spontaneous vomiting is common after ingestion of type II pyrethroids. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not routinely recommended as most exposures are trivial. With large ingestions, patients are at risk for abrupt onset of seizures or mental status depression. Charcoal administration should be limited to patients with a severely toxic ingestion who are awake and able to protect their airway or who have been intubated. Consider aspiration of gastric contents with a small nasogastric tube if it can be performed soon after a large ingestion of a concentrated insecticide solution. INHALATION EXPOSURE: Move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta-2 agonist and corticosteroids. OCULAR EXPOSURE: Remove contact lenses and irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia persists, patient should be seen in a healthcare facility. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area thoroughly with soap and water. A physician may need to examine the area if irritation or pain persists.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with excessive drowsiness and the inability to protect their own airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Lung injury may be more likely to occur due to the excipients (eg, piperonyl butoxide).  Supplemental oxygen; PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed. Consider surfactant in severe cases of acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Paresthesia: Topical vitamin E application may be effective in treating paresthesias.<\/li><li>Excessive salivation: Severe salivation may be treated with intravenous atropine.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: A patient with symptoms or a history of large or deliberate ingestion should be observed in an emergency department for at least 4 to 6 hours for any signs of CNS depression or seizures or the development of delayed pulmonary symptoms. The possibility of coingestants, such as hydrocarbons and organophosphate or carbamate insecticides, should be considered. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All patients who develop severe symptoms or have moderate symptoms that do not resolve over 6 to 12 hours of observation, should be admitted.
