It has also been used in to control ventricular dysrhythmias (ie, sustained ventricular tachycardia) that are life-threatening. PHARMACOLOGY: A Class 1C antiarrhythmic that has local anesthetic effects and stabilizing action on myocardial membranes. It reduces upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential, spontaneous automaticity, and the fast inward current carried by sodium ion in Purkinje fibers. It also prolongs effective refractory period and increases the diastolic excitability threshold and exerts a negative inotropic effect on the myocardium. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare, but can be life-threatening. Fatalities have been reported. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, proarrhythmic events (may cause new or worsen existing arrhythmias) and congestive heart failure in patients with a history of heart failure and\/or coronary artery disease. SEVERE TOXICITY: Events may develop within 3 hours of ingestion and include: coma, generalized seizures, hypotension, prolonged QRS, AV blocks, ventricular dysrhythmias that are often refractory to treatment, and metabolic acidosis. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Nausea, vomiting, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness, and ventricular tachydysrhythmias may occur with therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"agcws12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PROPAFENONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Obtain serial ECGs and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for hypotension, dysrhythmias, respiratory depression and the need for endotracheal intubation. Initially, treat hypotension with IV fluids. A prolonged QRS or QTc interval may respond to sodium bicarbonate. Initial dose: 1 to 2 mEq\/kg as an IV bolus repeated as needed to maintain arterial pH 7.45 to 7.55; monitor arterial blood gases and electrolytes. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Obtain serial ECGs and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor vital signs and neurologic function. Consider endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation early in unstable patients. Treat hypotension initially with IV fluids followed by vasopressors, if symptoms persist. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Cardiovert unstable ventricular dysrhythmias. Early ventricular dysrhythmias may respond to sodium bicarbonate 1 to 2 mEq\/kg as an IV bolus, repeated as needed to maintain arterial pH 7.45 to 7.55; monitor arterial blood gases and electrolytes. If unresponsive to bicarbonate, give lidocaine (first line agent), amiodarone. Monitor arterial blood gases and electrolytes. Consider intravenous lipid therapy early for patients with ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  GI decontamination is not recommended because of the risk of seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity or their airway is protected. Gastric lavage may be indicated following a large ingestion if the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation should be performed in patients who develop unstable cardiac dysrhythmias or respiratory depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for propafenone.<\/li><li>Bradycardia: ATROPINE: ADULT: 0.5 to 1 mg IV every 5 min (minimum single dose: 0.5 mg); maximum total dose 3 mg or 0.04 mg\/kg.  PEDIATRIC: 0.02 mg\/kg IV repeat every 5 min (minimum single dose: 0.1 mg). Maximum single dose in a child is 0.5 mg or 1 mg in an adolescent; maximum total dose is 1 mg in a child or 2 mg in an adolescent.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Monitor blood pressure. Administer 0.9% NaCl IV fluids, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Fat emulsion: In cases of severe overdose with hemodynamic instability, lipid resuscitation therapy (LRT) may be considered. Initial IV bolus of 1.5 mL\/kg 20% lipid emulsion (eg, Intralipid) over 2 to 3 minutes. May repeat dose in patients who are asystolic or have pulseless electrical activity. Follow with an IV infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min of 20% lipid emulsion (eg, Intralipid), while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate every 15 minutes during the infusion. The infusion rate may be increased if the bolus produced an initial response but hemodynamic instability re-emerges. The bolus may be repeated in severe cases. Limit LRT to 1 hour or less. Continued lipid infusion may be appropriate if the patient's stability requires longer treatment.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates as necessary. Initial dose: DIAZEPAM: ADULT: 5 to 10 mg IV, repeat every 10 to 15 minutes as needed; CHILD: 0.2 to 0.5 mg\/kg IV, repeat every 5 minutes as needed. LORAZEPAM: ADULT: 4 to 8 mg; CHILD: 0.05 to 0.1 mg\/kg. Consider propofol or phenobarbital, if seizures are uncontrollable or recur after diazepam 30 mg (adults) or 10 mg (children greater than 5 years). Phenytoin is generally NOT recommended as it may exacerbate cardiotoxicity.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Frequent vital signs and continuous pulse oximetry. Monitor serum electrolytes, glucose and renal function. Monitor arterial blood gases and liver enzymes in patients with severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Based on limited data, hemodialysis did not significantly alter the elimination of propafenone.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Cardiac dysfunction (ie, hypotension, dysrhythmias) and seizures may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. There is no data to support home management after overdose. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with overdose and all children with ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for evaluation and treatment. Patients ingesting immediate release preparations should be observed for at least 6 to 8 hours and those ingesting sustained release products for at least 10 to 14 hours, as toxic effects may be delayed\/prolonged after overdose of modified release formulations. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent hypotension, dysrhythmias or central nervous depression should be admitted to an intensive care setting.
