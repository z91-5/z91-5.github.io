PHARMACOLOGY: Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor; it causes the accumulation of acetylated histones and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of some cancer cell lines. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose of romidepsin is rare. TOXICITY: At the time of this review, there are no reports of overdose with romidepsin. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses; primarily nausea and vomiting, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, QTc prolongation and possibly ventricular dysrhythmias. ADVERSE EFFECTS: LESS SEVERE: Nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. SEVERE: Risk of QT prolongation or treatment-related ECG changes, infection, sepsis, fever, supraventricular dysrhythmia, leukopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia may develop. During clinical trials, most deaths were related to disease progression. In a small number of cases, the cause of death was due to cardiopulmonary failure, acute renal failure, infection, myocardial ischemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. <br\/>"},{"id":"929527-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ROMIDEPSIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

Institute cardiac monitoring, correct electrolyte abnormalities, and replace fluids lost through vomiting or diarrhea. Monitor serial CBC with differential. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors or blood products may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Decontamination is not necessary, romidepsin is administered parenterally.<\/li><li>Airway management: Assess airway patency. Oxygen therapy may be necessary for patients who develop cardiac or pulmonary failure, but this is rare with therapeutic use.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Severe Neutropenia: Filgrastim 5 mcg\/kg\/day subcutaneously, or sargramostim 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day.for patients with severe neutropenia or neutropenic fever. If the severity of overdose makes bone marrow failure likely, consider admission to a bone marrow transplant unit.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Treat hypotension with intravenous fluids; if hypotension persists, administer vasopressors.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Therapeutic doses of romidepsin may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium and\/or atrial overdrive pacing.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and serial CBC with differential. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor electrolytes in cases of severe vomiting or diarrhea. Monitor patients for clinical signs of infection.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are UNLIKELY to be of value due to the high degree of protein binding of romidepsin.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with significant overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation.
