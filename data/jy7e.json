indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. PHARMACOLOGY: Inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), is an antagonist at 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors, an agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, and is a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Overdose data are limited. Signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are anticipated to be similar to excessive pharmacologic adverse events. Ingestions of 40 to 75 mg have resulted in increased incidences of nausea, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, generalized pruritus, somnolence and flushing. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse reactions following therapeutic administration, with an incidence rate of at least 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo, include nausea, vomiting, and constipation. LESS FREQUENT: Adverse reactions that have occurred less frequently include: hyponatremia, dry mouth, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, dizziness, pruritus, flushing, somnolence, and abnormal dreams. Serotonin syndrome  (hyperreflexia, clonus, altered mental status, hemodynamic instability) has been reported with the use of vortioxetine alone and with the concurrent use of other serotonergic drugs. Withdrawal symptoms, following abrupt cessation of vortioxetine therapy, may include headache, muscle tension, dizziness, rhinorrhea, mood swings, and angry outbursts.<br\/>"},{"id":"jy7es12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VORTIOXETINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. Treat serotonin toxicity with benzodiazepines and consider cyproheptadine, if symptoms persist. Severe cases may require neuromuscular paralysis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is alert, not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is alert, not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. Gastric lavage is not recommended as overdose is rarely life threatening.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early with neuromuscular paralysis if patient presents with respiratory or CNS depression, severe muscle rigidity, or severe hyperthermia.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Treat initially with benzodiazepines. Cyproheptadine is sometimes used for moderate cases. Patients with severe serotonin syndrome (ie, severe hyperthermia, agitation, rigidity, hypertension, tachycardia, acidosis) may require neuromuscular paralysis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (including temperature) and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Vortioxetine plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with a small inadvertent small exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs.
