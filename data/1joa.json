Inhibits biosynthesis of ergosterol or other sterols, damaging the fungal cell wall membrane and altering its permeability. As a result, leakage of intracellular phosphorus compounds with accompanying breakdown of cellular nucleic acids and accelerated potassium efflux occurs . Clotrimazole also inhibits biosynthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids by fungi. In addition, it inhibits oxidative and peroxidative enzyme activity, resulting in intracellular buildup of toxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, which may contribute to deterioration of subcellular organelles and cellular necrosis. <\/li><li>Betamethasone dipropionate-Mechanism of betamethasone dipropionate's dermatological action is unclear. However, corticosteroids diffuse across cell membranes and complex with specific cytoplasmic receptors. These complexes then enter the cell nucleus, bind to DNA (chromatin), and stimulate transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) and subsequent protein synthesis of various enzymes thought to be ultimately responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects.   Betamethasone dipropionate is effective in treating inflamed dermatoses because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. <\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"1joas8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"1joas8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Topical: Clotrimazole- Minimal absorption following topical application to skin<\/li><li>Betamethasone dipropionate- May be absorbed from intact skin<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"1joas8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Topical: Betamethasone dipropionate (unabsorbed)- skin<\/li><li>Betamethasone dipropionate (absorbed)- Hepatic<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"1joas8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Topical: Biliary\/fecal and Renal <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"1joas9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Topical<\/b><br\/><ul><li>shake well before each use<\/li><li>do not use with occlusive dressings<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"1joas10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>symptomatic improvement in tinea corporis, tinea cruris, or tinea pedis is indicative of efficacy.<\/li><li>adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test; periodically during treatment  and after discontinuation<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"1joas11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Topical Cream: (Betamethasone Dipropionate - Clotrimazole) 0.05 %-1 %, 0.5 MG\/GM-10 MG\/GM<\/li><li>Topical Lotion: (Betamethasone Dipropionate - Clotrimazole) 0.05 %-1 %<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Lotrisone<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Topical Cream: (Betamethasone Dipropionate - Clotrimazole) 0.05 %-1 %<\/li><li>Topical Lotion: (Betamethasone Dipropionate - Clotrimazole) 0.05 %-1 %<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"1joas12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"1joas12b31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<ul><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/>USES: Antiinflammatory agents used to treat a variety of clinical conditions, including adrenal insufficiency, asthma, various allergy disorders, and autoimmune disorders (eg, hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus). Corticosteroids are available in oral, parenteral, inhalational, and topical formulations. PHARMACOLOGY: Multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions. Anti-inflammatory effects result from decreased formation, release and activity of the mediators of inflammation (eg, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) which reduced the initial manifestations of the inflammatory process. The immunosuppressive properties decrease the response to delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, type III and type IV).  The antiproliferative effects reduce hyperplastic tissue characteristic of psoriasis. TOXICOLOGY: Corticosteroids decrease calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion, and inhibit osteoblast formation, leading to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute toxicity following overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Acute ingestion is rarely a clinical problem. Acute adrenal insufficiency rarely reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial fibrillation)(methylPREDNISolone), seizures (methylPREDNISolone), anaphylaxis. CHRONIC EXPOSURE:  Cushingoid appearance, muscle wasting and weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia, subcapsulary cataracts and glaucoma, osteoporosis, psychosis. ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL:  Dysphoria, irritability, emotional liability, depression, fatigue,  anxiety, depersonalization, myalgia, and arthralgia.<br\/><\/li><li><b>IMIDAZOLE ANTIFUNGALS <\/b><br\/>USES: Imidazole agents (ie, butaconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, efinaconazole, oxiconazole, sertaconazole, sulconazole, and tioconazole) are broad-spectrum &quot;azole&quot; antifungals. PHARMACOLOGY: These drugs are fungistatic and may be fungicidal, depending on concentration. Imidazoles inhibit biosynthesis of ergosterol or other sterols, damaging the fungal cell membrane and altering its permeability.  As a result, loss of essential intracellular elements may occur. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose experience is limited with these agents.  Due to minimal oral absorption and limited systemic toxicity, severe toxic effects following oral overdose is not anticipated. Ingestion of even large quantities should produce only minor GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  ADVERSE EFFECTS: Allergic contact dermatitis to these agents is rare but has been reported.  Following dermal applications, pruritus, erythema, stinging, urticaria and localized edema have been reported. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequent side effects following oral administration of clotrimazole. Elevated liver enzymes have rarely been reported following the use of clotrimazole troches and sertaconazole 2% topical cream. Drowsiness and disorientation have been reported following oral clotrimazole therapy. Headache may infrequently occur following therapeutic use of these agents.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"1joas12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
