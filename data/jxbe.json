PHARMACOLOGY: Cabazitaxel, a microtubule inhibitor, binds to tubulin and promotes its assembly into microtubules while inhibiting disassembly. The stabilization that occurs produces inhibition of mitotic and interphase cellular functions. TOXICOLOGY: Cabazitaxel inhibits normal interphase and mitotic cellular function, causing cell death. Overdose effects are likely to occur in rapidly dividing cells (ie, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: At the time of this review, no overdose events have been reported with cabazitaxel. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Data are limited. Effects are anticipated to be similar to adverse effects reported during therapeutic use. Early symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (which may be severe) with potential alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance. Hematuria may occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Myelosuppression (neutropenia and leukopenia) is likely to develop and may be severe. Other potentially serious events include renal failure and severe diarrhea associated with electrolyte imbalance. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  COMMON: Neutropenia and leukopenia have been commonly reported with therapy. Several reports of death have been associated with neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. The most common grade 3 to 4 events include: neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, and asthenia. Renal failure, including some fatalities, has been reported with cabazitaxel use. Other common (greater than 10%) less severe events may include: nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, peripheral neuropathy, fever, dyspnea, dysgeusia, musculoskeletal symptoms, and hematuria. Hypersensitivity reactions have developed and are more likely to occur during the first or second dose. INFREQUENT: Less common adverse events may include: intestinal mucosa inflammation, dysrhythmias, hypotension, edema, and dysuria. <br\/>"},{"id":"jxbes12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CABAZITAXEL<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive, there is no antidote. Early signs of toxicity may include nausea\/vomiting and diarrhea, that can be severe. Treat with IV fluids, antidiarrheals (eg, high-dose loperamide, diphenoxylate) and antiemetics. It may be necessary to treat with multiple, concomitant agents, from different drug classes, in patients with persistent vomiting. BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION: Neutropenia should be anticipated. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure. Place patients with severe neutropenia in protective isolation. PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: May develop in overdose. Monitor and treat symptoms. MYALGIAS: Initially treat with NSAIDs. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: NEUTROPENIA: Bone marrow suppression (ie, neutropenia) may be severe. Neutropenia is the dose-dependent and the dose-limiting toxicity in therapy. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be initiated as soon as possible. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Platelet and red cell transfusions may be necessary. DIARRHEA: For severe or uncontrolled diarrhea treat with octreotide 100 mcg to 150 mcg IV (25 to 50 mcg\/hr), IV fluids, antibiotics and electrolyte replacement as needed. EMESIS: Aggressively treat with antiemetics and fluid and electrolyte replacement. Closely monitor patients for hypotension, bradycardia and other cardiac dysrhythmias. Monitor liver enzymes and renal function.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not indicated since overdose is unlikely because cabazitaxel is administered by the intravenous route. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal and\/or gastric lavage are generally not indicated, ingestion is unlikely.<\/li><li>Airway management: Consider orotracheal intubation in patients with significant CNS depression or respiratory failure.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote for cabazitaxel.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Severe neutropenia should be anticipated following a significant exposure. Place patients in protective isolation. Give colony stimulating factor as soon as possible. Closely monitor CBC with differential daily until patient recovery. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ (preferred route). Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours OR 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day SubQ once daily.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Vomiting: Treat nausea and vomiting with high-dose dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, promethazine or prochlorperazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, ondansetron, dolasetron, or granisetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and\/or antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol). Diphenhydramine may be required to prevent dystonic reactions from dopamine antagonists, phenothiazines, or antipsychotics. Replace fluid and electrolytes as needed. Monitor liver enzymes and renal function closely.<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Mucosal inflammation has occurred with other taxanes and may develop with cabazitaxel. Ice chips (ie, cryotherapy) may help minimize symptoms. Palifermin, a keratinocyte growth factor, is indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Treat mild symptoms of pain or xerostomia with bland rinses (ie, normal saline or sodium bicarbonate). Treat salivary gland dysfunction or xerostomia with sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, bethanechol, topical fluorides or remineralizing agents. Treat moderate pain symptoms with topical anesthetics (ie, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin) and mucosal coating agents (benzydamine) as needed. Moderate to severe symptoms may require systemic analgesics. Prophylactic treatment to prevent infection is suggested; topical or systemic treatment may be indicated. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with severe carbazitaxel overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Neuropathy: Peripheral neurotoxicity may develop in overdose. Cabazitaxel-induced neurotoxicity can produce peripheral neuropathy (sensory and motor). Monitor and treat symptoms as indicated. Pain is sometimes present.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free normal saline or Lactated Ringer's). For large overdoses, consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free NS or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Add albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP\/L NS or LR) to the perfusion solution to increase removal as cabazitaxel is highly protein bound. Give dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis, hemoperfusion and plasmapheresis are unlikely to be useful as cabazitaxel is highly protein-bound with a large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain CBC with differential and platelets daily to evaluate for bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia). Serial counts should be monitored until patient recovery. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Closely monitor liver enzymes, renal function, fluid status and electrolytes. Ensure adequate hydration, and correct electrolyte abnormalities as needed. Monitor vital signs, including temperature. Obtain an ECG. Continuous cardiac monitoring is indicated in patients with evidence of conduction abnormalities. Clinically evaluate patients for the development of mucositis and\/or peripheral neuropathy.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. Patients with a cabazitaxel overdose need to be admitted. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved, along with monitoring of serum electrolytes, renal function and hepatic enzymes. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with a cabazitaxel overdose.
