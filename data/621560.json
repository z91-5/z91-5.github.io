PHARMACOLOGY: Tranexamic acid is a synthetic amino acid analogue that interferes with the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. This produces an antifibrinolytic effect preventing clot breakdown reducing the risk of bleeding. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdoses are rare. Several cases of unintentional intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid have been reported. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tranexamic overdose data are limited. Nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension may occur in the event of an overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: The major adverse events due to tranexamic acid are the potential thromboembolic events, such as myocardial infarctions, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Severe pain, seizures, myoclonic twitching of facial muscles, ventricular fibrillation, coma, and death have been reported in patients following unintentional intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common occurrences with tranexamic acid therapy. INFREQUENT: Adverse effects that may occur less frequently following therapeutic administration of tranexamic acid include thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, renal cortical necrosis, visual disturbances, headaches and giddiness. <br\/>"},{"id":"621560-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>TRANEXAMIC ACID<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat patients with hypotension (IV 0.9% NS, dopamine, norepinephrine). MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive; closely monitor neurologic function. Treat severe hypotension (IV 0.9% NS, dopamine, norepinephrine). Treat seizures with benzodiazepines and barbiturates, or with propofol if seizures persist or recur. Look for clinical evidence of thromboembolic complications (e.g. chest pain, shortness of breath, flank pain, extremity pain) and obtain specific studies (e.g. CT, angiography) to evaluate for thromboembolic complications as needed.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal following oral exposure if patient is alert or airway is protected. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal following oral exposure if patient is alert or airway is protected; decontamination is not indicated following parenteral exposure.<\/li><li>Airway management: Assess airway; intubation and ventilation may be necessary in a patient unable to protect their airway due to significant CNS depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NS, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Highly neurotoxic. Intrathecal injection has been rapidly lethal. Information is derived from limited case reports and experience with antineoplastic agents.  Keep the patient upright and begin aggressive attempts to remove as much drug as possible. Immediately drain at least 20 ml CSF; drainage of up to 70 ml has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 ml aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers).  Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours).  Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis. Aggressive seizure control (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol) may be necessary. Support blood pressure with fluids and pressors as needed. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are likely to be needed. Monitor for ventricular dysrhythmias and treat per ACLS guidelines.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: While there are no specific lab tests that will be altered after therapeutic or overdose of tranexamic acid, including coagulation studies, the following would be appropriate to monitor: CBC with differential, platelets, renal function after significant overdose. Vital signs should be closely observed, as hypotension may occur with therapeutic infusion and overdose. Look for clinical evidence of thromboembolic complications (eg; chest pain, shortness of breath, flank pain, extremity pain). Specific studies (eg; CT, angiography) may be needed to evaluate for thromboembolic complications. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients. Monitor fluid and electrolyte status in patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with a minor inadvertent ingestion may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All symptomatic patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate ingestions demonstrating cardiotoxicity, seizure activity, or other persistent neurotoxicity should be admitted it an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Call a Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity, any patient with intrathecal injection, or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"621560-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>TRANEXAMIC ACID<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
