VinBLAStine as a single-agent regimen has been indicated for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease, advanced testicular germinal-cell cancers (ie, embryonal carcinoma, teratocarcinoma and choriocarcinoma). VinBLAStine has also been used for the palliative treatment of the following: generalized Hodgkin's disease (stage III and IV), lymphocytic lymphoma, histocytic lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, advanced carcinoma of the testis, Kaposi's sarcoma, Letterer-Siwe disease, and less frequently for choriocarcinoma and breast cancer. PHARMACOLOGY: VinBLAStine, the salt of an alkaloid extracted from Vinca rosea (periwinkle), is a dimeric alkaloid containing both indole and dihydroindole moieties. VinBLAStine inhibits microtubule formation in the mitotic spindle, that can arrest dividing cells at the metaphase stage. TOXICOLOGY: VinBLAStine inhibits mitotic cellular function causing cell death. Overdose effects are primarily hematologic (ie, bone marrow suppression) and gastrointestinal. Overdose over several days may be more toxic than the same dose given as a single infusion. EPIDEMIOLOGY: INTRAVENOUS: Intravenous overdose is rare with vinBLAStine, but can be fatal. INTRATHECAL: Inadvertent intrathecal administration has been reported rarely, all cases developed severe neurotoxicity and were fatal. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Early symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Toxic effects can progress over a few days to a week and include: constipation, malaise, bone marrow toxicity, bleeding, peripheral neuropathies, paralytic ileus, oral mucositis, hypertension (may be followed by hypotension), myalgias, and bone and jaw pain. Leukopenia is common; myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity. Neurotoxicity associated with vinBLAStine is less common than with vincristine. SEVERE TOXICITY: The severity of toxic effects are likely dose-related, the exact dose is unknown. Following a large overdose, the major effects will be due to myelosuppression. Significant neurotoxicity including: peripheral neuropathy and cerebral dysfunction (ie, seizures, coma) may develop. INTRATHECAL: Inadvertent intrathecal administration of vinBLAStine causes severe neurotoxicity and is fatal. An adult inadvertently received intrathecal vindesine and developed ascending neuropathy and encephalopathy; she died 6 weeks after exposure. ADVERSE EVENTS: The dose-limiting toxicity is bone marrow suppression (leukopenia is expected). Other common adverse effects with therapeutic use include: constipation, hypertension, malaise, bone pain, jaw pain, alopecia, pulmonary infiltrates, paresthesias, peripheral neuropathies, seizures, headache, malaise, paralytic ileus, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and stomatitis. LESS FREQUENT: Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, pharyngitis, diarrhea and bleeding may develop. Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) have been associated infrequently with vinBLAStine therapy; the events have been severe in some cases. RARE: Myocardial infarction, angina, ECG changes related to ischemia are rare events of vinBLAStine only therapy. Myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and Raynaud's phenomenon have been observed in patients receiving combination therapy with bleomycin and cisplatin. Acute shortness of breath and severe bronchospasm has occurred most often when vinBLAStine is combined with mitomycin C and requires aggressive care. OCULAR EXPOSURE: Splash eye injuries may cause delayed symptoms including epiphora, photophobia, impaired vision, pain, tearing, and corneal scarring. EXTRAVASATION: VinBLAStine is a vesicant. Extravasation can lead to tissue injury. <br\/>"},{"id":"659020-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VINBLASTINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote. Early events may include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal events may progress to include: constipation and paralytic ileus. Enemas may be indicated. Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting event with vinBLAStine; treat severe neutropenia with colony stimulating factors. Platelets and red cell transfusions may also be necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MYELOSUPPRESSION is likely to develop. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be administered if severe neutropenia develops. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Platelet and red cell transfusions may be necessary. NEUROTOXICITY: Central neurotoxicity (ie, seizures, coma) can develop following a significant IV overdose. Monitor airway and neuro status closely. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines, add propofol or barbiturate, if seizures persist. GASTROINTESTINAL: Severe paralytic ileus may develop. Abdominal decompression with nasogastric suction, and administration of enemas may be needed.  OTHER: Closely monitor vital signs; hypertension followed by hypotension can develop. Treat infections with antibiotics as needed. Monitor electrolytes for evidence of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH); fluid restriction may be necessary. Consider plasmapheresis or plasma exchange, if they can be performed within a few hours after a potentially fatal overdose.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection:  IMMEDIATE TREATMENT IS REQUIRED: Inadvertent intrathecal injection with vinBLAStine has been fatal. Experience is mostly with vincristine; however vinBLAStine and vindesine should be assumed to be extremely neurotoxic. Immediate, aggressive treatment is critical. The following information is based on inadvertent vincristine administration. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain AT LEAST 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon immediately for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for at least 24 hours). Fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP\/liter NS or LR) or albumin 5% should be added to the fluid used for perfusion to increase protein binding. Intravenous or oral therapy with folinic acid (leucovorin), glutamic acid, and pyridoxine have also been used in combination to minimize the neuropathy that develops with intrathecal vincristine. Administer dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  VinBLAStine is administered IV; GI decontamination is not indicated. HOSPITAL: Decontamination is not necessary as vinBLAStine is administered intravenously. For dermal exposures, clean skin with soap and water, and for eye exposures, flush with water.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect airway, or if unstable neurotoxicity (ie, seizures, coma), or respiratory depression develops following a severe overdose.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote for vinBLAStine.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Myelosuppression likely to occur following overdose. It is the dose-limiting toxicity reported with therapeutic use. Administer colony stimulating factors to patients who develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential for evidence of bone marrow suppression. If fever or infection develop, cultures should be obtained and appropriate antibiotics started. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Neuropathy: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The degree of peripheral neuropathy (ie, paraesthesia, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and muscle weakness) is usually dose-related. Although neurotoxic events are less common with vinBLAStine compared to vincristine, central and peripheral events have occurred. Monitor neurologic function closely. Prophylactic splinting during periods of muscle weakness may help to prevent deformities associated with contractures.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines, add propofol or barbiturates, if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, olanzapine).<\/li><li>Paralytic ileus: Gastrointestinal symptoms can include abdominal pain, constipation and paralytic ileus.  Bowel stimulants may be beneficial in preventing constipation. Enemas may be needed to prevent an ileus. Abdominal decompression via nasogastric suction may be indicated in severe cases.<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. It has not been studied in the setting of chemotherapy overdose. In patients with a vinBLAStine overdose, consider administering palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Syndrome of inappropriate vasopressin secretion: Supportive measures and fluid restriction are usually adequate. Administration of 3% NaCl solution (hypertonic saline) may be considered in severe cases. Monitor fluid and serum electrolytes (serum sodium) closely.<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: VinBLAStine, a vesicant, can produce pain and necrosis following extravasation. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Administer hyaluronidase (see below for dosing). Elevate the affected area. Apply warm packs for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily for 1 to 2 days. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable).  Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy. HYALURONIDASE: DOSE: Inject 1 to 6 mL of 150 Units\/mL through the existing IV line; if IV device was removed, inject by subQ route in a clockwise manner. Usual dose: 1 mL of solution for 1 mL of extravasated drug. Another source recommended the following dose: 150 Units (1 mL) given as five 0.2 mL injections into the extravasation site at the leading edge; use the 150 Units (1 mL per vial) solution and do not dilute further. Use a 25-gauge needle or smaller to inject subQ or intradermally into the extravasation site.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily until patient recovery. Based on therapeutic use, a decrease in WBC should be anticipated and is likely to occur from 5 to 10 days after a dose. Recovery to pretreatment levels usually occurs 7 to 14 days after treatment; these effects can be prolonged in the presence of bone marrow damage. Nadir would be anticipated to occur sooner following overdose. Monitor neurologic function closely following a significant exposure. Neurotoxic effects can present as peripheral, autonomic or cranial nerve (ie, vestibular and auditory damage due to the eighth cranial nerve) dysfunction. Monitor vital signs, serum electrolytes, renal function and liver enzymes. Monitor serum and urine osmolality in patients who develop hyponatremia. Obtain an ECG. Continuous cardiac monitoring is indicated in patients with evidence of conduction abnormalities. Clinically evaluate patients for the development of mucositis. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Consider plasmapheresis or plasma exchange if they can be performed within a few hours after a potentially fatal overdose. VinBLAStine is highly protein bound and distributes mostly to central compartment; plasmapheresis or plasma exchange have the potential to remove large amounts of drug if performed early, although there are no studies to address this question. Hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial following overdose because vinBLAStine is highly protein bound. In two children with vinBLAStine overdose, double volume exchange transfusion was started within 4 hours of exposure. Both patients recovered, although serum drug concentrations were not available to assess the treatment.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. Patients with a vinBLAStine overdose need to be admitted. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs, CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved and neurologic function, along with monitoring of gastrointestinal function, serum electrolytes, renal function and hepatic enzymes. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in a health care facility for a minimum of 72 hours after overdose. If neurologic effects are pronounced the patient should remain in a health care facility longer, based on clinical judgement, due to delayed onset of coma and seizures following large overdoses. Patients with myelosuppression should remain hospitalized until counts begin to recover. CONSULT CRITERIA: IMMEDIATELY consult a neurosurgeon if intrathecal exposure has occurred or is suspected. Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with a vinBLAStine overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with severe myelosuppression or large overdose may benefit from transfer to a bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"659020-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>VINBLASTINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Toxic serum\/blood concentrations not established. ADULT: An 83-year-old woman died of neutropenic sepsis after receiving 5 mg of vinBLAStine daily for 6 days. A young adult received a total dose of 56 mg of vinBLAStine over 2 days and developed SIADH and significant leukopenia and thrombocytopenia; he recovered with supportive care. PEDIATRIC: A 3-year-old survived a dose of 30 mg IV with supportive therapy. In another case, a 5-year-old girl received 29 mg (1.5 mg\/kg) of vinBLAStine and developed significant neurotoxicity (seizures and coma), myelosuppression, and gastrointestinal symptoms; the patient recovered with aggressive care. INTRATHECAL ADMINISTRATION OF VINBLASTINE IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE SEVERE NEUROTOXICITY AND DEATH. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT\/PEDIATRIC: Varies with disease state. Dose limit is dependent on the patient and protocol being used. ADULT: Doses may range from 3.7 to 18.5 mg\/m(2).
