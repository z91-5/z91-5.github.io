INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/>USES: Hepatitis C protease inhibitors are used for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), in combination with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa. This class includes boceprevir, simeprevir, and telaprevir. PHARMACOLOGY: Hepatitis C protease inhibitors specifically inhibit HCV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3\/4A) serine protease. Inhibition of serine protease causes a disruption in viral replication by preventing protein cleavage of specific nonstructural proteins NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B within the hepatitis C virus. These drugs are to be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and not as sole therapy. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon. OVERDOSE: No reports of overdose have been found except for clinical trial data. BOCEPREVIR: Daily doses of 3600 mg have been taken by healthy volunteers for 5 days without untoward symptomatic effects. TELAPREVIR: In clinical trials, 1875 mg every 8 hours for 4 days in healthy subjects caused nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dysgeusia and decreased appetite. ADVERSE EFFECTS: BOCEPREVIR: Alopecia, rash, dry skin, nausea, vomiting, dysgeusia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dry mouth, anemia, neutropenia, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, irritability, and dyspnea on exertion. SIMEPREVIR: COMMON (greater than 20%): Rash, photosensitivity, pruritus, and nausea. OTHER EFFECTS: Hyperbilirubinemia, myalgia, and dyspnea. TELAPREVIR: Nausea, vomiting, dysgeusia, rash, Sevens-Johnson syndrome, hemorrhoids or anal discomfort, anemia, and fatigue. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Hepatitis C protease inhibitors are strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4\/5.<br\/>"},{"id":"jxj3s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>HEPATITIS C PROTEASE INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, CBC and liver enzymes. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy. Monitor serial CBC with differential. Transfusion of packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe anemia. Consider colony stimulating factors in patients with severe neutropenia. Monitor for infection. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) should be treated with supportive care and corticosteroids.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal for recent, substantial ingestion in a patient who is alert and can protect the airway. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered for patients who present early after overdose and are alert and able to maintain their airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Obtain a basic metabolic panel. Monitor CBC and liver enzymes after significant overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in the management of overdose with hepatitis C protease inhibitors because of the large volume of distribution (boceprevir and telaprevir) or high protein binding (simeprevir).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with an inadvertent minor ingestion (or 1 or 2 doses) of a protease inhibitor, or asymptomatic children with inadvertent ingestion of 1 or 2 pills can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant fluid and electrolyte imbalance, anemia or neutropenia should be admitted. Patients with evidence of hepatic insufficiency or failure should be admitted.
