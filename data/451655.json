PHARMACOLOGY: Penicillin is derived from the fungus penicillum. As a class, penicillins contain a 6 aminopenicillanic acid nucleus, composed of a beta-lactam ring fused to a 5 member thiazolidine ring. Penicillins and other beta-lactams inhibit cell wall mucopeptide synthesis. TOXICOLOGY: A penicillin can act as an agonist at the picrotoxin binding site causing GABA antagonism, CNS excitation and seizures. High doses of amoxicillin can cause crystal precipitation in the urine, with hematuria and renal insufficiency. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Penicillin overdose is relatively uncommon, but has the potential to produce severe toxicity. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea may develop with ingestion. Skin rashes and urticaria may develop, especially with amoxicillin and ampicillin ingestions. Hematuria, crystalluria and transient renal insufficiency have been reported after amoxicillin overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Agitation, confusion, hallucinations, stupor, coma, multifocal myoclonus, seizures and encephalopathy may occur following massive doses of IV penicillins (40 to 100 million units\/day). Cardiac arrest and death have been associated with inadvertent intravenous administration of penicillin G (benzathine and procaine). Hyperkalemia may also develop. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: GASTROINTESTINAL: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric distress, and black hairy tongue are likely with orally administered penicillins. RENAL: Renal failure, crystalluria, interstitial nephritis, and hemorrhagic cystitis have been reported following the use of penicillin derivatives.Symptoms are frequently associated with sensitivity reactions and may include the following: DERMATOLOGY: Dermatologic reactions can vary greatly in severity, character, and distribution.  Amoxicillin and ampicillin appears to cause skin rashes more frequently than other penicillins. HEMATOLOGIC: Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have occurred following administration of the semisynthetic penicillins and may be related to a hypersensitivity reaction. SEVERE: Anaphylaxis may follow an exposure to any amount of penicillin; severe hypersensitivity reactions may result in anaphylaxis. Parenteral exposures are more likely to cause severe allergic reactions compared to an oral exposure. RARE: Penicillin-induced granulocytopenia is rare and has been associated with high-dose parenteral therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"451655-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PENICILLIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat significant vomiting and diarrhea with IV fluids; administer antiemetics, as needed. HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION: Administer antihistamines, with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: ANAPHYLAXIS: Acute anaphylaxis is more likely to occur after parenteral exposure, but may develop with all routes. Administer oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids. Dysrhythmias should be treated with standard antiarrhythmic drugs, if necessary. SEIZURES: Initially treat with IV benzodiazepines.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastric decontamination is unlikely to be necessary in most ingestions. HOSPITAL: GI decontamination is unlikely to be necessary, administer activated charcoal if the ingestion is recent and toxic coingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be needed following an overdose; however, aggressive airway management is indicated in patients that develop a significant hypersensitivity\/anaphylactoid reaction.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor renal function, urinalysis, and electrolytes following a significant overdose. Monitor fluid status in patients with severe vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Obtain a baseline ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with a significant IV overdose. Plasma levels of these antibiotics are not clinically useful in overdose situations.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: HEMODIALYSIS: Ampicillin-class antibiotics, amoxicillin and ticarcillin are removed from the circulation by hemodialysis, but as severe toxicity is highly unlikely hemodialysis is almost never indicated.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Intrathecal injection has occurred rarely with penicillins. Treat seizures aggressively (benzodiapzepines, barbiturates, propofol). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage and CSF exchange may be useful after a large overdose. The following information is derived from limited case reports and experience with antineoplastic agents. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers).  Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children with inadvertent ingestions of pediatric preparations can generally be managed at home. A small number of children ingesting more than 250 mg\/kg of amoxicillin have developed crystalluria, hematuria and transient renal insufficiency; any patient who develops urinary symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose or with more than mild symptoms should be evaluated in a health care facility. All patients with a history of penicillin allergy or evidence of a hypersensitivity reaction should be referred immediately to a healthcare facility. Patients should be observed until symptoms resolve and clinical parameters (eg, vital signs, mental status) are within normal limits. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with ongoing symptoms should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in patients with persistent renal or cardiovascular symptoms.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"451655-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PENICILLIN <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
