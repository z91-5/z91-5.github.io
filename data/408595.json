PHARMACOLOGY: Antagonist of H2 histamine receptors. This effect decreases gastric acid secretion. TOXICOLOGY: Cimetidine inhibits the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes, 1A2, C219, and 2D6, and decreases the metabolism of many other medications. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures to H2 blockers are common, but significant toxicity has not been described. Adverse effects during therapeutic use are rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild drowsiness, dizziness or confusion. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is exceedingly rare. CNS depression and hypotension have been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Dry mouth, delirium, and bone marrow suppression have been reported. Bradycardia and conduction effects are rare effects occurring mostly after rapid IV administration.<br\/>"},{"id":"408595-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CIMETIDINE AND RELATED DRUGS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

All patients with self-harm ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility for mental health evaluation. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose or more than mild symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility and observed until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant CNS depression or other symptoms that persist after 6 to 8 hours of observation should be admitted, but this is exceedingly rare.
