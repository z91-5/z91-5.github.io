PHARMACOLOGY: Growth of many breast cancer tumors is stimulated or maintained by estrogen. Anastrozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor that interferes with estradiol production in peripheral tissues by inhibiting conversion of adrenally-generated androstenedione to estrone by aromatase. Adrenally generated androstenedione is the chief source of circulating estrogen in postmenopausal women. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Severe overdose has not been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (GREATER THAN 10%): Nausea, vomiting, rash, hot flashes, headache, hypertension, vasodilation, peripheral edema, lymphedema, arthritis, arthralgia, back pain, asthenia, fatigue, depression, mood disturbances, cough, pharyngitis, and pain. OTHER EFFECTS: Chest pain, thromboembolic events (eg, pulmonary embolus, thrombophlebitis, and retinal vein thrombosis), pruritus, paresthesia, sweating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, constipation, anorexia, dry mouth, urinary tract infection, vaginal bleeding, leukopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, acute hepatitis, bone pain, myalgia, arthrosis, confusion, anxiety, nervousness, dizziness, dyspnea, sinusitis, bronchitis, and infection. <br\/>"},{"id":"923519-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ANASTROZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal for recent, substantial ingestion in a patient who is alert and can protect the airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal for recent, substantial ingestion in a patient who is alert and can protect the airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary unless other toxic agents have been administered concurrently.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs, CBC, and liver enzymes. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis may be helpful in a severe overdose because anastrozole is not highly protein bound<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923519-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ANASTROZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: In clinical trials, healthy, male volunteers tolerated a 60 mg single dose.
