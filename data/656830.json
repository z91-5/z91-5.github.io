These cause preferential inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, inhibition of virus-induced ribonucleotide reductase, or inhibition of other virus-specific enzymes involved in DNA synthesis that are more sensitive to inhibition than the corresponding host cell enzymes. This inhibition prevents lengthening of the DNA chain. Vidarabine may also be incorporated into both mammalian and viral DNA.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"656830-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"656830-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Ophthalmic: Active metabolite: arabinosyl hypoxanthine (ara-hx)<br\/>"}}},"10":{"id":"656830-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>fever, symptomatic improvement, increased level of consciousness<\/li><li>(ophthalmic) improvement in keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis<\/li><li>CBC<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"656830-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patient should wear sunglasses outside and avoid bright lights, as this medicine may cause photophobia.<\/li><li>This drug may cause burning, irritation, lacrimation, and foreign body sensation in the eye.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
