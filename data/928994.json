Inhibition of this enzyme results in lowering of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C), and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Although the precise mechanism of niacin in lowering lipid levels is unknown, it may involve reduction of esterification of hepatic triglycerides, decreased release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased activity of lipoprotein lipase. Niacin also appears to increase HDL-C, reduce hepatic synthesis of VLDL-C and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, but is not known to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols or bile acids.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"928994-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"928994-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Niacin, oral, extended release: 60% to 76%.<\/li><li>Simvastatin, oral, less than 5%<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"928994-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Niacin-Hepatic; extensive first-pass metabolism, conjugation<\/li><li>Active metabolite: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)<\/li><li>Simvastatin-Hepatic; P450 CYP3A4; hydrolysis, extensive first-pass metabolism<\/li><li>Active metabolites: beta-hydroxyacid (active inhibitor), 6'-hydroxy, 6'-hydroxymethyl and 6'-exomethylene derivatives<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"928994-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Niacin, Renal: 53% to 77% (3.6% to 7.7% unchanged, 51.4% as metabolites)<\/li><li>Simvastatin, Fecal: 60%<\/li><li>Simvastatin, Renal: 13%<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"928994-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Simvastatin, adults: 4.2 to 4.9 hours<\/li><li>Simvastatin acid, adults: 4.6 to 5 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"928994-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>swallow tablet whole, do not break or chew tablet<\/li><li>administer niacin\/simvastatin at least 4 to 6 hours before or after the administration of bile acid sequestrants<\/li><li>take at bedtime with a low fat meal or snack<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"928994-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>lipid panel to assess efficacy<\/li><li>liver function; at baseline and as clinically indicated; patients who warrant closer monitoring are those with renal insufficiency usually as a consequence of long-standing diabetes mellitus<\/li><li>creatine kinase; periodically may be considered in patients at risk of myopathy; although such monitoring may not prevent myopathy<\/li><li>fasting blood glucose; in patients with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus especially during the first few months of therapy<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"928994-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Simcor<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet, Extended Release: (Niacin - Simvastatin) 500 MG-20 MG, 500 MG-40 MG, 750 MG-20 MG, 1000 MG-20 MG, 1000 MG-40 MG<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"928994-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"928994-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<ul><li><b>LOVASTATIN AND RELATED DRUGS <\/b><br\/>USES: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The following agents are available in the United States: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. Atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin are also available in combination with other agents (atorvastatin\/amlodipine; lovastatin\/niacin; pravastatin\/aspirin; simvastatin\/ezetimibe; simvastatin\/niacin; simvastatin\/sitagliptin). PHARMACOLOGY: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, preventing conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate determining enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Ingestion of up to 6 grams of lovastatin has been reported without specific effects or sequelae. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not expected, unless a coingestant is present. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain, myopathy, myalgias, rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, dermatitis, diplopia, blepharoptosis (ptosis), ophthalmoplegia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have been reported in patients receiving statins. Other reported adverse effects (rare) include hyperkalemia (lovastatin), photosensitivity (simvastatin), dermatomyositis (simvastatin and pravastatin), limb compartment syndrome (simvastatin and atorvastatin), acute renal failure (lovastatin), pancreatitis (pravastatin and lovastatin\/gemfibrozil), chest pain (pravastatin), atrial fibrillation (simvastatin), vasculitis (atorvastatin), hemolytic anemia (lovastatin), thrombocytopenic purpura (atorvastatin), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (simvastatin), akathisia (lovastatin), extrapyramidal effects (lovastatin), nasopharyngitis (atorvastatin), upper respiratory infection (pravastatin), cough (pravastatin), lung fibrosis (simvastatin), peripheral neuropathy (lovastatin and simvastatin).<br\/><\/li><li><b>NIACIN AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Epigastric discomfort, sensation of warmth, chills and intermittent rash (diffuse, red, flat, and coalescent), primarily affecting scalp, face, and legs have been reported with niacin overdose. Tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain have been reported. Lactic acidosis has been occurred after acute overdoses with sustained release products. Severe hypotension has been reported following a massive niacin overdose (11,000 milligrams). Elevated hepatic enzymes have developed following overdose. Laboratory findings have also included hypo- and hyperglycemia and coagulopathy in some exposures. A teenager developed a prolonged QTc interval after ingesting 5.5 grams of niacin. ADVERSE EVENTS: Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are frequent symptoms after oral niacin therapy. Other adverse effects include dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, chills, edema, syncope, dryness of the skin, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, stimulation of peptic ulcer, amblyopia, jaundice and elevated hepatic enzymes, decrease in glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia.
