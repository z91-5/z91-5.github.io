They include natural androgens such as testosterone as well as synthetic androgens such as stanozolol and nandrolone. Medical indications for testosterone include hypogonadism, delayed puberty, and breast cancer in females.  Available formulations include capsules, transdermal and transbuccal formulations, intramuscular injections, and subcutaneous implantations. PHARMACOLOGY: Endogenous androgens promote the growth and development of the male sex organs as well as maintaining secondary sex characteristics.  Higher doses promote muscle mass and strength and increasing production of erythropoietin and subsequent increase in red blood cell production.  In addition, they may cause growth of facial and body hair, baldness, and increased sex drive and aggression. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicity from anabolic steroids is a result of their androgenic and anabolic processes. EPIDEMIOLOGY: As these substances are often used in a clandestine manner, it is difficult to know how commonly anabolic steroids are used\/abused.  However, it is known that they have been used by professional athletes, adolescents playing sports, as well as older people for \"anti-aging\" properties. Acute overdose is extremely rare. OVERDOSE: Toxicity from acute overdose is unlikely; however, chronic exposure to high doses may result in adverse effects. ADVERSE EFFECTS: CHRONIC USE:  Severe acne, baldness, high blood pressure and heart disease, headaches, strokes, mood swings and aggressive behavior, reduced sperm count, impotence, testicular atrophy, enlarged prostate leading to urinary problems, increased risk of tendon injuries, arthralgias, and virilization in women (reduced breast size, enlarged clitoris, increased facial and body hair, deepened voice, and menstrual problems). Local effects from the transdermal system SERIOUS EFFECTS: Deep venous thrombosis and strokes, extreme aggressive behavior, electrolyte changes, hepatitis and hepatic dysfunction, and anaphylactoid reactions. LOCAL EFFECTS: Effects from the transdermal system include pruritus at the application site (37%) and burn-like blisters (12%). Rarely, erythema, vesicles, allergic contact dermatitis, burning, and induration at the application site of the transdermal system may occur. Complications from transbuccal administration include gum edema, gum or mouth irritation, gum pain and tenderness, and taste perversions. <br\/>"},{"id":"ctkes12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ANABOLIC STEROIDS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Acute toxicity is extremely rare from these compounds, except perhaps local effects from transdermal and transbuccal administration. In terms of care for chronic use, the most immediate treatment would be cessation of use and then supportive care for associated symptoms. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Acute toxicity from anabolic steroid use is not expected, and the mainstay of treatment would be cessation of use and supportive care of symptoms. Extreme aggression may require treatment with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: There is no role for prehospital decontamination for this exposure. HOSPITAL: In general, decontamination is not indicated for this overdose. Activated charcoal could be considered for acute overdose with significant co-ingestions if the patient is awake and cooperative and if the ingestion was relatively recent.  There is no role for the use of lavage, whole bowel irrigation or multiple doses of charcoal.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with serious cardiac toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for anabolic steroids.<\/li><li>Drug withdrawal: Similar to other agents appropriate drug detoxification and recovery therapy.<\/li><li>Aggressive behavior: Treat with IV benzodiazepines or antipsychotics.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, particularly blood pressure. Monitor ECG in patients with cardiac symptoms or severe hypertension. Monitor liver enzymes, serum electrolytes, blood glucose, hemoglobin and hematocrit. PEDIATRIC: Obtain long bone radiographs to document the premature closure of the epiphysis in cases where children\/adolescents have chronically used anabolic steroids. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for specific anabolic steroid detection\/levels can be performed, but are not readily available and are not clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for dialysis, hemoperfusion, urinary alkalinization, or multiple dose charcoal for anabolic steroid use.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with unintentional exposures can be watched at home with follow up with their regular physician as needed.  OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with significant adverse effects should be sent to a healthcare facility for treatment of their symptoms and should not be sent home until the symptoms are treated or resolved. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe adverse reactions (eg, strokes) should be admitted, and depending on the severity of their symptoms, may merit an ICU admission. Criteria for discharge include resolution or treatment of their symptoms. CONSULT CRITERIA: The appropriate consultant should be called as needed (eg, neurologist for strokes, etc.). Consult a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"ctkes12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ANABOLIC STEROIDS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established.
