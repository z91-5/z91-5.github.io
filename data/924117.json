Specifically, it inhibits the formation of leukotrienes LTC 4, LTD 4, and LTE 4, which are the active constituents of slow-reacting substances of anaphylaxis, and LTB 4, a substance that attracts neutrophils and eosinophils. Leukotrienes produce numerous biological effects, including augmentation of neutrophil and eosinophil migration, neutrophil and monocyte aggregation, leukocyte adhesion, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. These effects contribute to inflammation, edema, mucus secretion, and bronchoconstriction in the airways of asthmatic patients. <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"924117-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"924117-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Effect of food, immediate-release tablets: increased Cmax by 27%, no effect on AUC or Tmax<\/li><li>Effect of food, extended-release tablets: increased AUC by 34% to 43%, mean Cmax by 18%, and Cmin by 170%, Tmax prolonged from 2.1 to 4.3 h<\/li><\/ul>"},"1":{"id":"924117-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Vd: 1.2 L\/kg<\/li><li>Protein binding: 93%<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"924117-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Hepatic; P450 CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 pathways and stereoselective glucuronidation<\/li><li>Active metabolites: O-glucuronide conjugates<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"924117-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Immediate-release tablets, 2.5 h<\/li><li>extended-release tablets,  3.2 h<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"924117-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(immediate-release tablets) may be taken with or without food<\/li><li>(extended-release tablets) take within 1 hour after morning and evening meals<\/li><li>(extended-release tablets) do not chew, cut, or crush<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"924117-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>improvement of pulmonary function tests, reduction of asthma symptoms, and decreased need for other asthma medications indicate efficacy<\/li><li>serum transaminases, especially ALT; baseline, during therapy starting with once monthly for 3 months, then every 2 to 3 months for the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter<\/li><li>neuropsychiatric events (eg, sleep disorders, behavior changes); throughout duration of therapy<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"924117-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Zyflo CR<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet, Extended Release: 600 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Zyflo<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 600 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"924117-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"924117-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>ZILEUTON<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: limited human data.
