Therefore, use parathyroid hormone only in patients that cannot be controlled with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone and for whom the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Avoid use in patients with an increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma (eg, Paget disease of bone, unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, pediatric and young adults with open epiphyses, hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma, and history of external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton).
