It is also used to treat schizoaffective disorder acutely as monotherapy and as adjunct therapy to antidepressants and\/or mood stabilizers. PHARMACOLOGY: Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone.  Although the specific mechanism of action of paliperidone is unknown, its proposed therapeutic activity is antagonism of both the central dopamine Type 2 (D(2)) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT(2A)) receptors. It also has antagonistic effects on the alpha-1 adrenergic, alpha-2 adrenergic, and H1 histaminergic receptors; however, the degree of affinity is unclear. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Drowsiness\/lethargy, tachycardia, dystonia, agitation\/irritability, tremor, hypertension, hypotension, confusion, dizziness\/vertigo, and muscle rigidity have been reported following paliperidone overdose. Severe toxicity following overdose has not been reported.

Manage severe extrapyramidal symptoms with anticholinergics and\/or benzodiazepines. Although rare, treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome with benzodiazepines, as well as cooling and supportive measures; consider bromocriptine and dantrolene in severe cases.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended due to the potential for somnolence and dystonic reaction.

Patients ingesting sustained release formulations should be observed for at least 24 hours as delayed toxicity has been reported. Patients with overdose of intramuscular paliperidone palmitate will require prolonged outpatient monitoring as it reaches peak concentrations at a median of 13 days.
