Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of carmustine. Blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose. At the recommended dosage, courses of carmustine should not be given more frequently than every 6 weeks. Pulmonary toxicity from carmustine appears to be dose related, as patients receiving greater than 1400 mg\/m(2) cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk than those receiving less. Delayed pulmonary toxicity can occur years after treatment, and can result in death, particularly in patients treated in childhood.<br\/>"},{"id":"108375-s-3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"108375-s-3-9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"hypersensitivity to carmustine <br\/>"},{"id":"108375-s-3-10","title":"Precautions","mono":"<ul><li>bone marrow toxicity, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia;

ADVERSE EFFECTS: BENDAMUSTINE: Hypersensitivity reactions (fever, chills, pruritus and rash) have occurred with therapy, but severe anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely. Myelosuppression is common, tumor lysis syndrome may cause renal failure. Rashes are common. CARMUSTINE: Hypotension, tachycardia and myocardial ischemia have been reported with high dose carmustine infusion. Thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia are common. Pulmonary toxicity may develop after carmustine therapy and may be dose related. Effects are more commonly reported in women and may present years after therapy. LOMUSTINE: Delayed myelosuppression is the most common and severe toxic effect. Pulmonary fibrosis has developed. Acute renal insufficiency and failure can develop. Nausea and vomiting are common.

Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free NS or LR). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative-free NS or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours).
