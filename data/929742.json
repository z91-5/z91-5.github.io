Argatroban, bivalirudin, desirudin, and lepirudin are used parenterally and are indicated for adjuvant anticoagulation for percutaneous cardiac interventions or as a substitution for heparin\/low-molecular-weight heparins in cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Dabigatran etexilate is an oral medication approved for treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents directly inhibit thrombin, leading to inhibition of clot formation and stabilization. TOXICOLOGY: The toxic effects are extensions of the pharmacologic effects and primarily include bleeding complications. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose data are limited. One patient, a 66-year-old man, ingested 9 g dabigatran in a suicide attempt and subsequently developed hypotension, bradycardia, and coagulopathy. Inpatient medication errors may occur in 1% to 2% of patients receiving DTIs. The incidence of overdose is likely to increase as new DTIs are approved for in-hospital parenteral use and oral anticoagulation indications. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY:  Bleeding complications that do not lead to cardiovascular compromise may be considered mild or moderate. SEVERE TOXICITY: Bleeding complications that lead to hypotension or difficulty with oxygen delivery can be considered severe.  Intracranial hemorrhage, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, or massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage may occur even at therapeutic doses of DTIs.  Allergic reactions have been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Hemorrhage, dyspepsia, back pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. LESS COMMON: Anemia, fever, hematomas, hematuria, gastrointestinal and rectal bleeding, epistaxis, intracranial bleeding, hypotension, cardiac arrest, dyspnea, cardiac dysrhythmias, abnormal hepatic and renal function, and hemothorax. RARE: Acute allergic reactions and formation of antihirudin antibodies have also been reported.<br\/>"},{"id":"929742-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Evaluate the need for anticoagulation and either decrease the dose or stop the infusion, whichever is clinically appropriate. Minor bleeding complications include epistaxis, mucous membrane bleeding, and poor clotting of minor cuts. Minor bleeding complications can usually be managed by simply stopping of the medication.  If the patient has blood loss that leads to cardiovascular instability, blood product transfusion should be considered. Patients with symptomatic anemia can be managed with red-blood-cell (RBC) transfusion alone. Allergic reactions should be treated with cessation of infusion, antihistamines, steroids, and intramuscular epinephrine for anaphylactic reactions.  MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Stop the infusion; administer isotonic fluid for hypotension, packed RBCs for anemia. Patients with significant continued blood loss despite cessation of the direct thrombin inhibitor infusion should be given fresh-frozen-plasma (FFP) in an attempt to competitively antagonize the thrombin inhibition.  Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) or cryoprecipitate may be considered because they have a higher concentration of thrombin per volume when compared with FFP, however they carry a higher risk of thromboembolic complications. Allergic reactions should be treated with cessation of infusion, antihistamines, steroids, and intramuscular epinephrine for severe anaphylactic reactions.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: DABIGATRAN: Consider activated charcoal within 1 to 2 hours of an overdose. PARENTERAL DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS: Decontamination is not indicated for the majority of overdoses because they are primarily available in parenteral formulations in the United States. HOSPITAL: DABIGATRAN: Consider activated charcoal within 1 to 2 hours of an overdose. PARENTERAL DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS: Decontamination is not indicated for the majority of overdoses because they are primarily available in parenteral formulations in the United States.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management should be considered for critically ill patients not able to protect their airway. DTIs are not expected to affect the respiratory status of patients.<\/li><li>Antidote: There are no specific antidotes available for treatment of DTI induced bleeding complications.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), and complete blood counts (CBC). PT, INR, and aPTT may all be affected by direct thrombin inhibitors, though there is not a linear relationship and interpretation of these values should be made with caution. Monitor for evidence of bleeding (eg, venous access sites, urinary, gastrointestinal, vaginal). Monitor serial hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients with suspected bleeding. Monitor renal function because it will affect medication half-life. Obtain an ECG in patients with anemia or chest pain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Theoretically, these agents are dialyzable.  However, dialysis is generally not practical in patients with major bleeding complications. DABIGATRAN: Due to low protein binding, dialysis may remove approximately 60% of dabigatran from the blood over 2 to 3 hours.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME MANAGEMENT: Patients that unintentionally ingest one or two doses of oral DTIs may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Intentional overdoses should be referred to a health care facility. Patients with bleeding complications should be referred to a health care facility. Patients with oral overdoses should be observed for six hours with reassessment for bleeding complications. Patients with minor bleeding complications can be observed until the bleeding is controlled. Direct thrombin inhibitor dosing adjustments should be considered prior to discharge in bleeding patients. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with more than minor bleeding complications should be admitted for serial hemoglobin and hematocrit monitoring. CONSULT CRITERIA: If the patient still requires parenteral anticoagulation, hematology should be consulted for anticoagulation guidance. A toxicologist may be consulted in patients with severe toxicity.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929742-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY:  A specific toxic dose has not been identified for specific agents.

Patients on dabigatran have received doses of up to 600 mg without major bleeding events. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: DABIGATRAN: 150 mg orally twice daily. DESIRUDIN: 15 mg every 12 hour subcutaneously.
