Effects","mono":"<b>ILOPERIDONE<\/b><br\/>USES: Atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia. PHARMACOLOGY: A piperidinyl-benzisoxazole derivative with high antagonist affinity for dopamine (D2) and serotonin (5-HT2) receptors. TOXICOLOGY: Dopamine receptor blockade results in extrapyramidal symptoms, and alpha1-adrenergic effects are responsible for orthostatic hypotension. Iloperidone's affinity, albeit low affinity, for histamine receptors contributes to anticholinergic effects (tachycardia, dry mouth). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Unintentional and deliberate poisonings of atypical antipsychotics are common and occasionally severe. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tachycardia and hypotension are common. Depressed mental status, somnolence and extrapyramidal symptoms also fairly common. SEVERE TOXICITY: QTc prolongation, extrapyramidal symptoms likely. Respiratory depression, seizure, or coma could potentially occur, as well as neuroleptic malignant syndrome. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, nasal congestion, orthostatic hypotension, somnolence, and tachycardia. Nausea, diarrhea, extrapyramidal disorder, and QT prolongation have also been reported with therapeutic doses of iloperidone. <br\/>"},{"id":"929366-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ILOPERIDONE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Management will primarily be symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat seizures with benzodiazepines. Treat hypotension with IV fluids and pressors (norepinephrine preferred) if needed. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias with sodium bicarbonate, use lidocaine or amiodarone if bicarbonate unsuccessful. Manage severe extrapyramidal symptoms with anticholinergics and\/or benzodiazepines. Although rare, treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome with benzodiazepines, bromocriptine, consider dantrolene, as well as cooling and supportive measures.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended due to the potential for somnolence, seizures and dystonic reaction. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a recent, significant overdose who is alert or in whom airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Insure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with serious cardiac toxicity, coma or significant CNS depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; add propofol, or barbiturates if seizures recur or persist.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Treat hypotension with intravenous fluids, if hypotension persists administer vasopressors. Norepinephrine is preferred; the manufacturer recommends avoidance of epinephrine and dopamine since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of iloperidone-induced alpha blockade.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders (particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia). Sodium bicarbonate is generally first line therapy for QRS widening and ventricular dysrhythmias, administer 1 to 2 mEq\/kg, repeat as needed maintain blood pH between 7.45 and 7.55. In patients unresponsive to bicarbonate, consider lidocaine or amiodarone.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor serum electrolytes including sodium, potassium, and magnesium, as well as glucose; obtain CBC.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility.
