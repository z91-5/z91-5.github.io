It is also indicated for the management of pheochromocytoma in patients when surgery is contraindicated and for the chronic treatment of malignant pheochromocytoma. PHARMACOLOGY: Metyrosine blocks the rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway of catecholamines. It is a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, blocking the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine. This inhibition results in decreased levels of endogenous catecholamines. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose information is limited. It is anticipated that overdose effects would be an extension of adverse effects occurring during therapeutic use. Persistent fatigue or sedation, anxiety, agitation, diarrhea, dry mouth, decreased salivation, and extrapyramidal signs, including tremors of the hands and trunk and tightening of the jaw with trismus, may occur following an overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Moderate to severe sedation is the most common adverse effect with metyrosine therapy. Other adverse effects that appear to be dose-dependent include extrapyramidal signs (eg, drooling, tremor, and speech difficulty), anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, confusion, diarrhea, and dry mouth. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may infrequently occur with metyrosine therapy. Peripheral edema, crystalluria, transient dysuria and hematuria, eosinophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombocytosis, and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely. <br\/>"},{"id":"927554-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>METYROSINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Intravenous fluid: Administer oral or intravenous fluid to maintain a urine output of at least 2000 mL\/day.<\/li><li>Drug-induced dystonia: Treat dystonia with either benztropine or diphenhydramine.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status in symptomatic patients. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Examine urine following overdose for evidence of crystalluria, and monitor urine output. Monitor renal function in patients with crystalluria.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe symptoms despite treatment should be admitted.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a regional poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"927554-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>METYROSINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
