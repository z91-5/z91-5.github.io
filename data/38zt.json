It is primarily used as an immunosuppressant for organ transplant, but is also used to treat psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, other autoimmune disorders, and dry eyes. PHARMACOLOGY: The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but cycloSPORINE is thought to suppress helper T-lymphocyte proliferation, and activation. It is also thought to decrease lymphokine release. TOXICOLOGY: CycloSPORINE inhibits sodium-dependent uptake of bile salt transport across canalicular membranes resulting in cholestasis. It is also directly nephrotoxic. Because it is an immunosuppressant, it can also increase risk of infection, lymphoma, and lymphoproliferative disorders. EPIDEMIOLOGY: CycloSPORINE ingestion is an uncommon cause of poisoning. Ingestions are usually unintentional, and rarely result in severe manifestations. Parenteral overdose, though uncommon, are usually more serious than oral overdose. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Usually occurs via the oral route of administration, and may include headache, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, dysesthesias, taste abnormalities, flushing, tremor, fasciculations, and edema. SEVERE TOXICITY: Usually occurs via the parenteral route of administration, and may include hyperkalemia (severe), nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, encephalopathy, neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal bleed, metabolic acidosis, allergic reaction, acute lung injury, CNS depression, seizure, coma, dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Hypertension, elevated BUN\/serum creatinine, hirsutism, infection, tremor, gingival hyperplasia, headache, hypertriglyceridemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leg cramps, paresthesias, dizziness, stomatitis, edema, rash, arthralgia, flushing, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, depression, optic disc edema, intracranial hypertension, glomerular capillary thrombosis, pancreatitis, malignancy, diabetes, hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia have been reported with therapeutic use.<br\/>"},{"id":"38zts12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CYCLOSPORINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most exposures are mild and require only supportive care. Replete magnesium if needed. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Support respiratory and cardiovascular function as needed. Treat severe hyperkalemia, resulting in ECG changes, with dextrose\/insulin and calcium. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines. Toxic nephropathy has been treated with low dose dopamine. PARENTERAL: Parenteral exposures are often more serious than oral ingestions. Treat in a similar manner to a large oral overdose. EYE EXPOSURE: CycloSPORINE also comes as an ophthalmic solution used to treat dry eyes and may increase the risk of an ocular infection. Flush the eye copiously with tepid tap water or saline with at least 1 liter per eye. Consider using local anesthetic drops for pain control and to ease irrigation.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Generally, no decontamination is needed in the prehospital setting. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be utilized for worrisome ingestions.<\/li><li>Airway management: Provide supportive care.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes, especially magnesium and potassium. Monitor renal function, liver enzymes, and CBC with differential. Measure triglycerides. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. Consider obtaining acetaminophen or salicylate concentrations if there is any uncertainty regarding drug ingested.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Because of its large molecular weight, hemodialysis or other forms of enhanced elimination are of no benefit.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with unintentional ingestions may be observed at home if asymptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients and those with deliberate ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. Patients who have minimal symptoms 6 hours after ingestion may be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients requiring ongoing supportive care may need admission. Once asymptomatic for 6 hours, they may be discharged. CONSULT CRITERIA: Severe poisoning may occur with large oral or parenteral exposures of cycloSPORINE. If concerned, consult a medical toxicologist for guidance. Consult specialists if hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, or neurologic symptoms persist.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"38zts12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CYCLOSPORINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ORAL: CycloSPORINE does not appear to be highly toxic orally. Doses of 30 to 400 mg\/kg produced only minor symptoms. Adults ingesting 5 g acutely, or 25 g over 8 days, have not developed serious toxicity. Inadvertent ingestions of 500 and 600 mg by a 2-month-old and 3-year-old child (104 and 46 mg\/kg, respectively) did not result in significant toxicity. PARENTERAL: An adult died of cerebral edema after receiving an intravenous infusion of 30 mg\/hour (a ten-fold overdose) for 13 hours immediately after a lung transplant. Neonates receiving 179 to 400 mg\/kg IV developed severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, and cyanosis. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Dosing regimens vary widely. TRANSPLANT REJECTION: ADULT: ORAL:  Initially, 15 mg\/kg as a single dose 4 to 12 hours before cardiac, liver, or renal transplant; continue same dose as daily dose for 1 to 2 weeks and then decrease by 5% per week to a maintenance dose of 5 to 10 mg\/kg\/day; IV: Initially, 5 to 6 mg\/kg\/day as a single dose 4 to 12 hours before cardiac, liver, or renal transplant; continue same initial dose as daily dose until patient can tolerate oral formulation. PEDIATRIC: ORAL: Initially, 15 mg\/kg administered 4 to 12 hours before cardiac, liver, or renal transplant or postoperatively; continue same dose as daily dose for 1 to 2 weeks; total daily dose should be divided into 2 equal daily doses; doses are then adjusted to attain center-defined trough blood concentrations. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (SEVERE): ADULT: Initially, 2.5 mg\/kg\/day orally divided twice daily; dose may be increased by 0.5 to 0.75 mg\/kg\/day at 8 weeks and 12 weeks; MAX: 4 mg\/kg\/day.
