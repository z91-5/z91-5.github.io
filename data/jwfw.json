PHARMACOLOGY: Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator that acts locally to increase intestinal fluid secretion. It specifically activates the ClC2 receptor, a chloride channel that resides in the apical membrane of the intestine. Increased chloride-containing intestinal fluid secretion results, functioning to increase motility and the passage of stools through the intestine. Activation of ClC2 is independent of protein kinase A. In vitro studies have indicated that the activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is primarily only on the apical (luminal) epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract. Sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum are not affected. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Overdose data is limited.  The following adverse events were reported in 51 patients who received a single oral dose of 144 mcg of lubiprostone (6 times the normal single dose): nausea (45.1%), vomiting (27.5%), diarrhea (25.5%), dizziness (17.6%), loose or watery stools (13.7%), headache (11.8%), retching (7.8%), abdominal pain (5.9%), flushing (5.9%), dyspnea (3.9%), pallor (3.9%), stomach discomfort (3.9%), syncope (3.9%), upper abdominal pain (2%), anorexia (2%), asthenia (2%), chest discomfort (2%), dry mouth (2%), hyperhidrosis (2%), skin irritation (2%), and vasovagal episode (2%). ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, diarrhea, and headache. OTHER EFFECTS: Abdominal pain, flatulence, vomiting, dyspepsia, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, peripheral edema, fatigue, chest pain or discomfort, fever, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremity, muscle cramp, dyspnea, cough, weight increase, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and hypertension. <br\/>"},{"id":"jwfws12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LUBIPROSTONE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose of lubiprostone.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Lubiprostone undergoes minimal absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose of lubiprostone. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. HOSPITAL: Lubiprostone undergoes minimal absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose of lubiprostone. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. Consider activated charcoal only after very large ingestions or if coingestants with significant toxicity are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Should not be required in these cases.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs in symptomatic patients. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with severe vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no information regarding the effectiveness of hemodialysis or hemoperfusion for the removal of lubiprostone from plasma. Since systemic absorption is minimal, methods to enhance systemic elimination are unlikely to be necessary.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jwfws12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>LUBIPROSTONE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Overdose data is limited.  An adult took 96 mcg\/day for 8 days without adverse effects. A 3-year-old ingested 7 or 8 capsules of lubiprostone (24 mcg each) and recovered. The following adverse events were reported in a Phase 1 cardiac repolarization study after 51 patients received a single oral dose of 144 mcg of lubiprostone (6 times the normal single dose): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, loose or watery stools, headache, retching, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspnea, pallor, stomach discomfort, syncope, upper abdominal pain, anorexia, asthenia, chest discomfort, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, skin irritation, and vasovagal episode. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULTS: Chronic idiopathic constipation: 24 mcg orally twice daily. Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation: 8 mcg orally twice daily.
