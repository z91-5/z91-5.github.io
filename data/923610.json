PHARMACOLOGY: Docetaxel, a microtubule inhibitor, binds to tubulin and promotes its assembly into microtubules while inhibiting disassembly. The stabilization that occurs produces inhibition of mitotic and interphase cellular functions. TOXICOLOGY: Docetaxel inhibits normal interphase and mitotic cellular function, causing cell death. Overdose effects are seen primarily in rapidly dividing cells (ie, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Inadvertent exposure or overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Data are limited. Overdose effects are expected to be an extension of adverse events and include bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity, and mucositis. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Early symptoms may include: nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. SEVERE TOXICITY: Myelosuppression (neutropenia and febrile neutropenia) is likely to develop and can be severe. Anemia and thrombocytopenia may develop. Other potentially serious events include: liver function impairment; fluid retention leading to edema, dyspnea, cardiac tamponade, or pleural effusion; and severe stomatitis. Patients with abnormal liver function are at increased risk of toxicity. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Potentially serious events across all indications have included: infections, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fluid retention, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypersensitivity, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, and mucositis and\/or stomatitis. Patients with alterations in liver function are more likely to experience serious adverse events including death. Other common events observed with docetaxel include: fever, peripheral neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, pain, skin reactions, motor dysfunction, myalgia, and alopecia. INFREQUENT: Cardiac dysrhythmias and hypotension are relatively uncommon with therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"923610-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DOCETAXEL<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive, there is no antidote. Early signs of toxicity may include nausea\/vomiting and diarrhea, that can be severe. It may be necessary to treat with multiple concomitant agents, from different drug classes, in patients with persistent symptoms. BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION: Neutropenia should be anticipated. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure. Place patients with severe neutropenia in protective isolation. PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Likely to develop in overdose. Monitor and treat symptoms. Effects are usually reversible, but may persist for long periods. MYALGIAS: Initially treat with NSAIDs. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: NEUTROPENIA: Bone marrow suppression (ie, neutropenia) may be severe. Neutropenia is the dose-dependent and the dose-limiting toxicity in therapy. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be initiated as soon as possible. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Platelet and red cell transfusions may be necessary. EMESIS: Aggressively treat with antiemetics and fluid and electrolyte replacement as indicated. Closely monitor patients for hypotension, bradycardia, and other cardiac dysrhythmias. Monitor liver enzymes and renal function.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Docetaxel is only available parenterally; oral exposure is unlikely. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal and\/or gastric lavage are not indicated since overdose most often occurs by the intravenous route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Consider orotracheal intubation in patients with significant CNS depression or respiratory failure.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Severe neutropenia should be anticipated following a significant exposure. Place patients in protective isolation. Give colony stimulating factor as soon as possible. Closely monitor CBC with differential daily until patient recovery. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ (preferred route). Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours OR 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day SubQ once daily.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Vomiting: Docetaxel is of low emetogenic potential in therapeutic use. If nausea and vomiting develop, treat with high-dose dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, promethazine or prochlorperazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, ondansetron, dolasetron, or granisetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and\/or antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol). Diphenhydramine may be required to prevent dystonic reactions from dopamine antagonists, phenothiazines, or antipsychotics. Replace fluid and electrolytes as needed. Monitor liver enzymes and renal function closely.<\/li><li>Diarrhea: For mild to moderate diarrhea without signs of infection, treat with loperamide 2 mg every 4 hours for 24 hours. Patients with severe, uncontrolled diarrhea should be treated with octreotide, aggressive IV fluid management, and antibiotics. Monitor electrolytes as indicated.<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Ice chips (ie, cryotherapy) may help minimize symptoms. Treat mild symptoms of pain or xerostomia with bland rinses (ie, normal saline or sodium bicarbonate). Treat salivary gland dysfunction or xerostomia with sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, bethanechol, topical fluorides or remineralizing agents. Treat moderate pain symptoms with topical anesthetics (ie, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin) and mucosal coating agents (benzydamine) as needed. Moderate to severe symptoms may require systemic analgesics. Prophylactic treatment to prevent infection is suggested; topical or systemic treatment may be indicated. Palifermin, a keratinocyte growth factor, is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with severe docetaxel overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Peripheral axonal neuropathy: Peripheral neurotoxicity should be anticipated in overdose. Monitor and treat symptoms as indicated.<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Events are usually mild with docetaxel. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Several cases have reported the use of either warm compresses\/soaks (for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily for 1 to 2 days) or local cooling (ice packs can be applied for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily). Elevate the affected area. Apply a warm or cold compress as indicated (see below). Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable). Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial following a docetaxel overdose due to its high protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free normal saline or Lactated Ringer's). For large overdoses, consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free NS or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP\/L NS or LR) may also be useful for perfusion because of docetaxel's high protein binding. Give dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain CBC with differential daily to evaluate for bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia). The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (less than 500 cells\/mm(3)) was 7 days in therapeutic use. Serial counts should be monitored until patient recovery. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Closely monitor liver enzymes, renal function, fluid status and electrolytes. Ensure adequate hydration and correct electrolyte abnormalities as needed. Monitor vital signs, including temperature. Monitor ECG for possible cardiac dysrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is indicated in patients with evidence of conduction abnormalities. Clinically evaluate patients for the development of mucositis and\/or peripheral neuropathy.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. Patients with a docetaxel overdose need to be admitted. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved, along with monitoring of serum electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic enzymes. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with a docetaxel overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with severe overdose or profound neutropenia may benefit from a transfer to a bone marrow transplant or cancer treatment center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923610-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>DOCETAXEL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Limited data.
