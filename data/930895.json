Elosulfase alfa, a purified human enzyme produced by recombinant DNA technology, provides exogenous N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase. The mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of elosulfase alfa bind to mannose-6-phosphate receptors of lysosomal cells resulting in cellular uptake of elosulfase alfa and increased catabolism of KS and C6S.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"930895-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"930895-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Tmax, IV: 172 minutes (week 0); 202 minutes (week 22) <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"930895-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: 396 mL\/kg (week 0); 650 mL\/kg (week 22) <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"930895-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Total body clearance: 10 mL\/min\/kg (week 0); 7.08 mL\/min\/kg (week 22) <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"930895-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"7.52 minutes (week 0); 35.9 minutes (week 22) <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"930895-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>preparation and administration should be done under the supervision of a healthcare professional with the ability to manage medical emergencies<\/li><li>(body weight less than 25 kg) dilute the appropriate dose in NS to a final volume of 100 mL; infuse at 3 mL\/hr for 15 minutes, and then 6 mL\/hr for next 15 minutes; increase as tolerated in 6 mL\/hr increments every 15 minutes to a MAX infusion rate of 36 mL\/hr; minimum infusion time 3.5 hours<\/li><li>(body weight 25 kg or greater) dilute the appropriate dose in NS to a final volume of 250 mL; infuse at 6 mL\/hr for 15 minutes, and then 12 mL\/hr for the next 15 minutes; increase as tolerated in 12 mL\/hr increments every 15 minutes to a MAX infusion rate of 72 mL\/hr; minimum infusion time 4.5 hours<\/li><li>do not agitate or shake product; gently rotate infusion bag for proper distribution<\/li><li>administer using a low protein-binding infusion set with a 0.2-micrometer in-line filter<\/li><li>do not infuse with other products<\/li><li>infusion rate may be slowed, temporarily stopped, or discontinued if hypersensitivity reactions occur.<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"930895-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>improvement in signs and symptoms of mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA may indicate efficacy<\/li><li>spinal or cervical cord compression, signs and symptoms<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"930895-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Vimizim<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 1 MG\/ML<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"930895-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"Side effects may include pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, chills, or fatigue.<br\/>"}}}
