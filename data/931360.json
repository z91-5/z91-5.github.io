It has been approved under an accelerated approval process based on progression free survival; ongoing approval is contingent upon further clinical benefit. PHARMACOLOGY: Panobinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that works at nanomolar concentrations to inhibit the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones and some non-histone proteins. This inhibition further results in increased acetylation of histone proteins, an epigenetic change resulting in a relaxing of chromatin, leading to transcriptional activation. Panobinostat induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis of some transformed cells, with an affinity for tumor cells. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Limited experience with this agent. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an exaggeration of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Hematologic and gastrointestinal events including thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia have occurred. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, peripheral edema, decreased appetite, pyrexia, and vomiting have occurred frequently (incidence of at least 20%) with therapeutic use. Hematologic laboratory abnormalities (incidence of greater than or equal to 60%) have included thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Other commonly reported laboratory abnormalities (incidence of greater than or equal to 40%) have included hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and increased creatinine. Deaths have been reported in patients treated with panobinostat and were most often related to infection and hemorrhage. DISCONTINUATION OF THERAPY: Diarrhea, fatigue, and pneumonia have been the primary adverse events leading to discontinuation of panobinostat therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"931360-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PANOBINOSTAT<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY:  Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent diarrhea with antidiarrheals and treat nausea and\/or vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Ensure adequate hydration and correct electrolyte abnormalities. Conduction abnormalities have occurred with panobinostat; obtain a baseline ECG and initiate continuous cardiac monitoring. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) to patients with neutropenia. Hemorrhage (both gastrointestinal and pulmonary) has been reported with panobinostat therapy. Monitor platelet count and CBC frequently. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Significant systemic infections including pneumonia, bacterial, viral and invasive fungal infections have occurred with therapy. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection and start anti-infective therapy as soon as possible.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and the airway can be protected. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and the airway can be protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary following a minor exposure; monitor for dyspnea and wheezing following a significant exposure.

Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours OR 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day SubQ once daily. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Severe thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage have developed with panobinostat therapy; monitor platelets closely and transfuse platelets and\/or packed red cells in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage.  Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Diarrhea: Severe diarrhea has developed in patients receiving panobinostat. Persistent diarrhea should be treated with antidiarrheals. Ensure adequate hydration and correct any electrolyte abnormalities.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, olanzapine).<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Significant cardiac events including ischemia, severe dysrhythmias (ie, atrial and ventricular) have been reported with panobinostat therapy in patients with advanced cancer. Obtain a baseline ECG and initiate continuous cardiac monitoring.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen.  Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders (particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia). Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, particularly in patients with underlying impaired cardiac function.  Amiodarone should be used with caution if a substance that prolongs the QT interval and\/or causes torsades de pointes is involved in the overdose.  Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Monitor for clinical evidence of bleeding. Hemorrhage (both gastrointestinal and pulmonary) has been reported with panobinostat therapy. Monitor platelet count frequently along with CBC. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Ensure adequate hydration. Monitor vital signs, including temperature. Obtain a baseline ECG. Continuous cardiac monitoring is indicated in patients with evidence of conduction abnormalities. Monitor electrolytes and correct any abnormalities. Closely monitor liver enzymes, renal function, fluid status and electrolytes. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Serum panobinostat concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Panobinostat is highly protein bound (90%); therefore, hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with a minor inadvertent ingestion (1 to 2 tablets) can remain at home. If symptoms develop, patients need to be evaluated in a healthcare facility. Inadvertent pediatric ingestions should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess their electrolytes and fluid balance. A baseline CBC with differential and platelet count should be obtained. Ongoing laboratory monitoring should be arranged until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Patients with evidence of bone marrow suppression should be admitted. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), cardiac monitoring as indicated, and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. Patients should also be admitted for persistent profuse diarrhea, severe vomiting, dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with an overdose. PATIENT-TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931360-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PANOBINOSTAT<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established.
