By inhibiting ACE, angiotensin II production is decreased, vasoconstriction is reduced, plasma renin activity is increased, and aldosterone secretion is decreased which causes diuresis and natriuresis and a small increase in serum potassium. ACE is also identical to kininase II which is an enzyme that degrades bradykinin leading to endothelium-dependent vasodilation.<\/li><li>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The exact mechanism by which hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood pressure is not known. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and chloride by acting directly on the distal renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption. This results in a reduced plasma volume, increased plasma renin activity, increased aldosterone secretion, and decreased serum potassium.

EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are common, but toxicity is generally mild. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents inhibit angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE), thus preventing conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone secretion (aldosterone suppression reduces sodium and water retention). ACE inhibitors also prevent the breakdown of bradykinin (a potent vasodilator). The net result is vasodilatation, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, decreased blood pressure, increased cardiac output, and a relative increase in renal, cerebral, and coronary blood flow. TOXICOLOGY: The toxic effect of an ACE inhibitor is an extension of its pharmacologic effect. The elevation in bradykinin concentration appears to be the primary cause of both ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and cough. ACE inhibitors may also inhibit the metabolism of enkephalins and potentiate their opioid effect, which includes lowering blood pressure. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild hypotension. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, bradycardia, and renal failure. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Dry cough, hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency in patients with renal artery stenosis, maculopapular rash, angioneurotic edema, neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity.<br\/><\/li><li><b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/>USES: Class of drugs that are primarily used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Potassium sparing diuretics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Work in a variety of mechanisms including inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (thiazides), inhibiting transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle (loop), and osmotic agents (mannitol). TOXICOLOGY: Produce hypovolemia and electrolyte deficiencies. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Rare overdose which uncommonly results in significant morbidity or death. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild dehydration, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, headache, muscle cramps, thirst, and brisk diuresis. Large doses of furosemide or ethacrynic acid can cause ototoxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, mental status changes, and electrolyte abnormalities (i.e. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia) are the most common manifestations of severe poisoning. Rarely muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, coma, or dysrhythmias may develop secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities.  CNS depression has been reported rarely in children with acute ingestion without significant electrolyte abnormalities. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Thiazides are associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Furosemide has been associated with ototoxicity, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  Diuretics have a large number of drug interactions as well. Extravasation of mannitol can cause tissue injury and compartment syndrome.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924363-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ACE INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients will have no symptoms, but patients with mild orthostatic hypotension can be treated by remaining prone.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if the patient presents with circulatory collapse. Correct severe hyperkalemia using standard treatments such as glucose, insulin, calcium, sodium bicarbonate, sodium polystyrene sulfate and hemodialysis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: As severe toxicity is very rare, prehospital decontamination is generally not recommended.

The dose of naloxone should be administered in titrated doses starting with 0.2 to 2 mg IV repeated every 2 to 3 minutes to improve blood pressure; maximum dose 8 mg.

Adjust to blood pressure response LISINOPRIL: ADULT: 5 to 40 mg\/day orally. PEDIATRIC: 0.07 mg\/kg\/day; maximum 5 mg. PERINDOPRIL: ADULT: 4 to 16 mg in 1 or 2 divided doses; maximum 16 mg\/day. RAMIPRIL: ADULT: 2.5 to 20 mg once daily; maximum: 20 mg daily.<br\/><\/li><li><b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Toxic doses are not well established.  Diuresis is expected to result at even therapeutic doses.  Toxicity is most common with chronic dosing and acute toxicity is often related to other factors such as comorbid conditions and access to fluid replacement. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Furosemide is typically dosed at 20 to 80 mg with repeat doses as necessary in adults; pediatric dose is 1 to 2 mg\/kg orally.  Hydrochlorothiazide is typically dosed at 12.5 to 50 mg daily in adults; pediatric dose is 1 to 3 mg\/kg divided twice daily.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"}]},{"id":"924363-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Drug may cause angioedema (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, eyes, lips, or tongue).
