Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan's action is independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. An AT2 receptor is also found in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT1 rather than the AT2 receptor. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.<\/li><li>In addition to to inhibiting the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response of bradykinin. It is unknown whether this difference has clinical relevance.<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"926966-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"926966-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Bioavailability: 26%; food effects none<br\/>"},{"id":"926966-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 17 L<br\/>"},{"id":"926966-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: GI tract: rapidly and completely bioactivated olmesartan     <br\/>"},{"id":"926966-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: 50 to 65%; Renal: 35 to 50%<br\/>"},{"id":"926966-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 13 h<br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"926966-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>take with or without food<\/li><li>children who cannot swallow tablets may use the manufacturer's extemporaneous suspension 2 mg\/mL formulation<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"926966-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>blood pressure reduction is evidence of efficacy<\/li><li>renal function; in patients with renal impairment<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of hypotension; when initiating therapy in patients with possible volume- or salt-depletion (eg, concomitant diuretics, especially with impaired renal function)<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"926966-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Benicar<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 5 MG, 20 MG, 40 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"926966-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patient should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination until drug effects are realized.<\/li><li>This drug may cause diarrhea, headache, and fatigue.<\/li><li>Counsel patient to immediately report severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report symptomatic hypotension.<\/li><li>Tell patient to maintain adequate hydration.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
