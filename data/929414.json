Effects","mono":"<b>TAPENTADOL<\/b><br\/>USES: Tapentadol is used for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. PHARMACOLOGY: Tapentadol exerts its analgesic effects by binding to mu-opioid receptors and by inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake. It appears to be 18 times less potent than morphine in binding to the mu-opioid receptor. TOXICOLOGY: The exact mechanism of analgesic effect is unknown, but therapeutic and toxic effects are likely mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimetic. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Although rarely reported, overdose may occur and can be life-threatening. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and pinpoint pupils. SEVERE POISONING: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia. Death may result from any of these complications. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects with therapeutic administration of tapentadol include dizziness, somnolence, nausea, and vomiting. <br\/>"},{"id":"929414-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>TAPENTADOL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Tapentadol overdoses can be life-threatening. Activated charcoal should be considered early after a significant oral ingestion, if a patient can protect their airway and is without significant signs of toxicity. If a patient is displaying signs of moderate to severe toxicity, do NOT administer activated charcoal because of the risk of aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patient, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Tapentadol plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may not detect synthetic opioids such as tapentadol, and are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of tapentadol toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions, and all children with ingestions should be sent to a health care facility. IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Observe patients for at least 4 to 6 hours (maximum serum concentrations are reached at 1.25 hours after therapeutic dose) as symptoms will likely develop within this time period. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. EXTENDED RELEASE: Observe patients for at least 8 to 12 hours (maximum serum concentrations are reached between 3 and 6 hours after therapeutic dose) as symptoms will likely develop during this period. ADMISSION CRITERIA: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Those with significant, persistent central nervous system depression should be admitted to the hospital. A patient needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as a extended release formulation has likely been taken; additional doses may be needed. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, and those needing a naloxone infusion or who are intubated should be admitted to an intensive care setting. EXTENDED RELEASE:  Patients with even mild to moderate opioid effects, and those who require naloxone after ingestion of a extended release formulation, should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929414-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>TAPENTADOL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY:  Toxic dose is not established, and varies with the tolerance of the individual. PEDIATRIC: A 16-month-old girl ingested a reported 100 mg (2 tablets) of tapentadol and was admitted to an intensive care setting with dyspnea, drowsiness\/lethargy, pallor, and vomiting; she recovered with oxygen therapy. Another infant, a 9-month old, ingested a reported 50 mg (1 tablet) and developed coma and respiratory depression requiring naloxone and IV fluids; the child recovered completely. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: The usual recommended dose is 50 to 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, with the second dose, on the first day of dosing, administered as early as one hour after the first dose if needed. Subsequent dosing is maintained at 4 to 6 hours.
