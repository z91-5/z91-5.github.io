Salicylates are also combined with narcotics to treat moderate to severe pain. OPIOIDS: These agents are commonly abused for their euphoric effects. PHARMACOLOGY: SALICYLATES: Salicylates inhibit cyclooxygenase, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins, and cause platelet dysfunction. OPIOIDS: Opioids are a group of chemical substances, naturally occurring and synthetic, that bind at the opiate receptor. Opiates are a group of naturally occurring compounds derived from the poppy, Papaver somniferum. TOXICOLOGY: SALICYLATES: Salicylates stimulate the respiratory center in the brainstem, interfere with the Krebs cycle (limiting ATP production), uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (causing accumulation of pyruvic and lactic acid and heat production), and increase fatty acid metabolism (generating ketone bodies). The net result is a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. OPIOIDS:  Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: GENERAL: A relatively common poisoning, that can result in significant morbidity and mortality. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: SALICYLATES: GI upset, tinnitus, tachypnea, and respiratory alkalosis. OPIOIDS: Early toxicity is likely due to the opioid effects and can include: euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting and pinpoint pupils. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE TOXICITY: SALICYLATES: Metabolic acidosis, hyperpnea, diaphoresis, fever, altered mental status, seizures, coma, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema and death. Chronic overdoses present more insidiously and may be subtle, especially in the elderly, and may consist primarily of neurologic manifestations such as confusion, delirium, and agitation. Coagulopathy, hepatic injury, and dysrhythmias are rare complications of severe overdose. OPIOIDS: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia. Death may result from any of these complications. ADVERSE EFFECTS: SALICYLATES:  GI upset and tinnitus. OPIOIDS: Nausea, vomiting, constipation and mild sedation are common. CHRONIC abuse of these products may result in opioid addiction or chronic salicylism. <br\/>"},{"id":"926646-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SALICYLATES-OPIOIDS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: SALICYLATES: An initial salicylate level should be obtained and repeated every 1 to 2 hours until a clear peak and decline is observed. Start intravenous fluids. Concentrations greater than 30 mg\/dL and rising should be treated with urine alkalinization. The presence of a large anion gap metabolic acidosis or altered mental status indicates a more severe poisoning. OPIOIDS: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: SALICYLATES: Patients with severe poisoning should be continued on urine alkalinization; hemodialysis should be strongly considered. Relative indications for hemodialysis include: renal failure, congestive heart failure, altered mental status, seizures, evidence of cerebral edema, worsening acidosis despite adequate resuscitation, persistently rising salicylate concentrations despite adequate treatment (greater than 50 to 60 mg\/dL in a chronic poisoning or levels greater than 90 to 100 mg\/dL in an acute overdose). Patients with an altered mental status may have cerebral edema; a head CT should be obtained. Mannitol can be given for cerebral edema. OPIOIDS: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). AIRWAY MANAGEMENT: SALICYLATES:  Severely ill patients may require respiratory support and intubation. Maintain preintubation minute ventilation at the same high respiratory rate because once the patient's respiratory drive is removed metabolic acidosis may worsen. OPIOIDS: Orotracheal intubation may also be indicated in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression due to opioid exposure that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in the prehospital setting if the patient is awake, normal mental status, and can protect their airway and does not show signs of significant toxicity. If the patient is displaying signs of moderate to severe toxicity do NOT administer activated charcoal because of the risk of aspiration. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be administered to any patient who presents within several hours of a significant ingestion, can adequately protect their airway, and has no alteration in mental status. However, it is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of opioid toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Consider the use of gastric lavage for patients that present with large ingestions within 2 hours.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Patients who are comatose or with altered mental status may need mechanical respiratory support and orotracheal intubation. If the patient requires intubation, monitor end-tidal CO2 and arterial blood gases frequently and maintain the preintubation minute ventilation to prevent severe acidosis.<\/li><li>Naloxone: OPIOIDS: Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed with these agents. A CONTINUOUS infusion may be necessary in patients that have ingested a long-acting opioid. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1 to 2 hours. Many opioids have a much longer duration of effect, so it is necessary to observe the patient at least 3 to 4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Fluid\/electrolyte balance regulation: SALICYLATES: Correct dehydration with 0.9% saline 10 to 20 mL\/kg\/hour over 1 to 2 hours until a good urine flow is obtained (at least 3 to 6 mL\/kg\/hour).  In patients in whom urinary alkalinization is being considered, initial hydration may be with 10 to 20 mL\/kg of D5W with 88 to 132 mEq of bicarbonate added.  Patients in shock may require more rapid fluid administration. Correct hypokalemia with intravenous potassium boluses and oral potassium. Monitor urine output and pH hourly.<\/li><li>Acidosis: SALICYLATES: Administer 1 to 2 mEq\/kg NaHCO3 by IV bolus and begin urinary alkalinization.  Monitor blood gases and urinary pH to guide frequency and quantity of administration. Patients with refractory acidosis, inability to maintain appropriate respiratory alkalosis, or acidemia should be treated with hemodialysis.<\/li><li>Alkaline diuresis: SALICYLATES: Urinary alkalization will increase elimination of salicylates. Place 150 mEq (3 ampules) of NaHCO3 in 1 liter of 5% dextrose to provide an isotonic solution; administer 10 to 20 mL\/kg initially as a bolus, then infuse at 2 to 3 mL\/kg\/hour. Administer 20 to 40 mEq\/L of potassium chloride as an IV infusion as needed to maintain normokalemia. Oral potassium may be administered, if tolerated. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia may occur with alkalinization and hypokalemia can prevent the development of an alkaline urine. Monitor serum electrolytes (in particular potassium and calcium), serum and urinary pH frequently (every 1 to 2 hours); goal of therapy is a urine pH of 7.5 to 8.<\/li><li>Seizure: OPIOIDS\/SALICYLATES: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist. Seizures associated with salicylate toxicity should be managed similar to an opioid exposure.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: OPIOIDS: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: OPIOIDS\/SALICYLATES: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid or salicylate overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: SALICYLATES: Obtain serial salicylate levels every 1 to 2 hours until concentrations have peaked and are declining; basic metabolic panel every 2 hours until clinical improvement; arterial or venous blood gas for patients undergoing urinary alkalinization or moderate\/severe toxicity. In addition, obtain CBC, liver enzymes, renal function studies, INR and PTT in patients with clinical evidence of moderate\/severe toxicity. OPIOIDS: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Opioid plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: SALICYLATES: Hemodialysis efficiently removes salicylate and corrects acid base and electrolyte abnormalities. Hemodialysis is recommended in patients with high serum salicylate levels (greater than 90 to 100 mg\/dL after acute overdose, to 50 to 60 mg\/dL with chronic intoxication), refractory acidosis, inability to maintain appropriate respiratory alkalosis, acidemia, evidence of CNS toxicity (i.e., seizures, mental status depression, persistent confusion, coma, and cerebral edema), progressive clinical deterioration despite appropriate fluid therapy and attempted urinary alkalinization, acute lung injury, inability to tolerate sodium bicarbonate (e.g., renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema), refractory\/profound electrolyte disturbances, or renal failure. The clinical condition of the patient is more important than the serum salicylate concentration in determining the need for hemodialysis, especially in patients with chronic toxicity or delayed presentation after acute overdose. In patients with early presentation after acute overdose, serum concentrations approaching 100 mg\/dL warrant consideration for dialysis even with mild or moderate clinical manifestations of toxicity. Administer a second dose of activated charcoal to patients with persistently rising salicylate levels despite urinary alkalinization and an initial dose of activated charcoal. Consider whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol for patients with large ingestions of enteric coated products if they are alert and able to protect the airway. OPIOIDS: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are NOT of value because of the large volume of distribution for opioids.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Home criteria is usually NOT indicated following ingestion of these combination products. Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA:  GENERAL: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions and all children with ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for observation. SALICYLATES: Patients with intentional ingestions and those with unintentional ingestions greater than 150 mg\/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin equivalent doses, whichever is less, should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. Patients who have a well defined peak and decline in salicylate concentration and mild to moderate symptoms that resolve with treatment can often be treated and released from an ED observation unit. OPIOIDS: Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. ADMISSION CRITERIA: SALICYLATES: Patients who have a rising salicylate concentration, metabolic acidosis, or alterations in mental status should be admitted to an intensive care setting. OPIOIDS: Patients with significant persistent central nervous depression should be admitted to the hospital. Patients needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as they may have taken a longer-acting opioid and may need additional doses. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, or delirium or those needing a naloxone infusion or intubated patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing severe poisonings and for recommendations on determining the need for hemodialysis. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy who do not require referral to a healthcare facility for other reasons (ie ingested dose or symptoms) should be referred to an obstetrician for outpatient follow up and assessment of maternal fetal risk.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926646-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>SALICYLATES-OPIOIDS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: SALICYLATES: The acute ingestion of less than 150 mg\/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin equivalent, whichever is less, is not expected to cause significant salicylate toxicity.
