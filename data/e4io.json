In addition, vinCRIStine has been used to treat a variety of other malignancies (ie, small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, gynecologic cancer) and nonmalignant conditions (ie, thrombocytopenia purpura).  PHARMACOLOGY: The mechanism of vinCRIStine is not completely understood. VinCRIStine appears to bind to the microtubules and induces mitotic arrest of dividing cells in the metaphase stage. In therapeutic use, vinCRIStine does not appear to easily cross the blood brain barrier. TOXICOLOGY: VinCRIStine inhibits mitotic cellular function, causing cell death. Overdose effects are primarily neurologic, gastrointestinal, and hematologic (ie, bone marrow suppression). Following intrathecal administration, toxicity is related to acute necrotizing myeloencephalopathy. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Intravenous overdose is rare, but can be fatal. Inadvertent intrathecal administration is rare, but causes severe neurotoxicity and is most often fatal. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Early signs and symptoms may include: fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Toxic effects can progress over a few hours to a week and include: peripheral neuropathies, bone marrow toxicity, bleeding, cerebral dysfunction, constipation, abdominal distension, paralytic ileus, oral mucositis, hypertension (may be followed by hypotension), myalgias, and bone and jaw pain. Other effects reported less frequently include: urinary retention, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), bladder atony, and diarrhea. SEVERE TOXICITY: The severity of toxic effects are usually dose-related. In some cases, deaths have occurred within a few days of exposure. Following a large overdose, significant neurotoxicity including: peripheral neuropathy (sensory loss, paresthesia, loss of deep tendon reflexes) and cerebral dysfunction (ie, agitation, insomnia, seizures, delirium, hallucinations, depression), that can progress to coma and death should be anticipated. Myelosuppression can also develop after a severe overdose. INTRATHECAL: Inadvertent intrathecal administration produces ascending paralysis and severe neurotoxicity that can progress to respiratory failure and coma. It is usually fatal. Immediate treatment is necessary. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Neurotoxicity is the primary dose-limiting toxicity with therapeutic use. Peripheral neuropathies (ie, paresthesia, sensory loss, and loss of deep tendon reflexes) are likely to occur and usually resolve with discontinuation of therapy. An early sign of peripheral neuropathy is the loss of the Achilles tendon reflexes. Other effects may include: autonomic dysfunction (ie, gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal distension, and paralytic ileus), hypertension, hypotension, muscle wasting, fever, bone marrow suppression, pain and SIADH following long-term vinCRIStine therapy. Ocular findings include ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. EXTRAVASATION: VinCRIStine is a vesicant. Extravasation can lead to severe tissue injury that may require surgical intervention. <br\/>"},{"id":"e4ios12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VINCRISTINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote. Early events may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever. Neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting event with vinCRIStine. Early symptoms are likely to include peripheral neuropathy (ie, sensory impairment and paresthesia). Monitor neuro status closely.  Glutamic acid may be effective in reducing neurotoxicity, the usual adult dose is 10 g IV over 24 hours followed by 500 mg IV every 8 hours. Gastrointestinal events may progress to include: abdominal distension, constipation and paralytic ileus. Enemas may be indicated. Myelosuppression may develop; treat severe neutropenia with colony stimulating factors, platelets and transfusions as indicated. SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. NEUROTOXICITY: Central neurotoxicity (ie, seizures, ascending paralysis, respiratory compromise and coma) can develop following a significant IV overdose. Monitor airway and neuro status closely. Glutamic acid may be effective in reducing neurotoxicity, the usual adult dose is 10 g IV over 24 hours followed by 500 mg IV every 8 hours. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines, add propofol or barbiturate if seizures persist. MYELOSUPPRESSION may develop. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be administered if severe neutropenia develops. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Platelet and red cell transfusions may be necessary. GASTROINTESTINAL: Severe abdominal distension and paralytic ileus may develop. Abdominal decompression with nasogastric suction, and administration of enemas may be needed. VOMITING: Aggressively treat with antiemetics and fluid and electrolyte replacement as indicated. OTHER: Closely monitor vital signs; hypertension followed by hypotension can develop. Treat infections with antibiotics as needed. Monitor electrolytes for evidence of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH); fluid restriction may be necessary. Consider plasmapheresis or exchange transfusion if they can be performed within a few hours after a potentially fatal overdose.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: IMMEDIATE TREATMENT IS REQUIRED: Inadvertent intrathecal injection with vinCRIStine is usually fatal. Immediate, aggressive treatment is critical. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain AT LEAST 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon immediately for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for at least 24 hours). Fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP\/liter NS or LR) or albumin 5% should be added to the fluid used for perfusion to increase protein binding. Intravenous or oral therapy with folinic acid (leucovorin), glutamic acid, and pyridoxine have also been used in combination to minimize the neuropathy that develops with intrathecal vinCRIStine. Administer dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: GI decontamination is not necessary as vinCRIStine is administered IV.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect airway or if unstable neurotoxicity (ie, seizures, ascending paralysis) or respiratory depression develops following a severe overdose.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote for vinCRIStine.<\/li><li>Neurotoxicity: Neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting event with vinCRIStine. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The degree of peripheral neuropathy (ie, paraesthesia, loss of deep tendon reflexes, foot drop and muscle weakness) is usually dose-related and reversible. Central neurotoxicity can develop following a significant IV exposure and will occur following an intrathecal administration (ie ascending paralysis, respiratory compromise, coma); fatalities have occurred (see INTRATHECAL INJECTION). Monitor neurologic function closely. Glutamic acid may be effective in reducing neurotoxicity. The usual adult dose is 10 g IV over 24 hours followed by 500 mg IV every 8 hours. Folinic acid and pyridoxine have also been used, but their efficacy is not established. Prophylactic splinting during periods of muscle weakness may help to prevent deformities associated with contractures.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines, if seizures persist add propofol or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Nausea and vomiting are early findings of vinCRIStine toxicity. Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol). AVOID: Aprepitant may cause a possible drug interaction (ie, CYP3A4 inhibition).<\/li><li>Paralytic ileus: Autonomic neuropathy can produce gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, constipation and paralytic ileus.  Bowel stimulants may be beneficial in preventing constipation. Enemas may be needed to prevent an ileus. Abdominal decompression via nasogastric suction may be indicated in some patients.<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Mucositis has been reported with vinCRIStine overdose. Ice chips (ie, cryotherapy) may help minimize symptoms. Treat mild symptoms of pain or xerostomia with bland rinses (ie, normal saline or sodium bicarbonate). Treat salivary gland dysfunction or xerostomia with sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, bethanechol, topical fluorides or remineralizing agents. Treat moderate pain symptoms with topical anesthetics (ie, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin) and mucosal coating agents (benzydamine) as needed. Moderate to severe symptoms may require systemic analgesics. Prophylactic treatment to prevent infection is suggested; topical or systemic treatment may be indicated. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with a vinCRIStine overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Severe myelosuppression is NOT the primary dose-limiting toxicity of vinCRIStine. However, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia have occurred following therapeutic use and overdose. Most reports of myelosuppression following overdose with vinCRIStine have occurred as a result of receiving multiple chemotherapeutic agents. Administer colony stimulating factors to patients with severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential for evidence of bone marrow suppression. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. If fever or infection develop during leukopenic phase, cultures should be obtained and appropriate antibiotics started. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation.<\/li><li>Syndrome of inappropriate vasopressin secretion: Supportive measures and fluid restriction are usually adequate. Administration of 3% NaCl solution (hypertonic saline) may be considered in severe cases. Monitor fluid and electrolytes (serum sodium) closely.<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: VinCRIStine, a vesicant, can produce pain and necrosis following extravasation. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Administer hyaluronidase (see below for dosing). Elevate the affected area. Apply warm packs for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily for 1 to 2 days. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable).  Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy. HYALURONIDASE: DOSE: Inject 1 to 6 mL of 150 Units\/mL through the existing IV line; if IV device was removed, inject by subQ route in a clockwise manner. Usual dose: 1 mL of solution for 1 mL of extravasated drug. Another source recommended the following dose: 150 Units (1 mL) given as five 0.2 mL injections into the extravasation site at the leading edge; use solution 150 Units (1 mL vial) and do not dilute further. Use a 25-gauge needle or smaller to inject subQ or intradermally into the extravasation site.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor neurologic function closely following exposure. Neurotoxicity can present as peripheral, autonomic or cranial nerve dysfunction. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily until patient recovery. Based on several cases of overdose, myelotoxicity is likely to occur within a week or less of exposure (WBC nadir occurred at day 4 to 10; platelet nadir often occurred at day 4). Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes. Monitor serum and urine osmolality in patients with hyponatremia. Monitor vital signs. Obtain baseline ECG. Monitor fluid intake and output. Monitor uric acid concentration. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of mucositis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Consider plasmapheresis or exchange transfusion if they can be performed within a few hours after a potentially fatal overdose. Hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial following overdose. Plasmapheresis of 1.5 times the plasma volume reduced vinCRIStine concentration by 23% in an adult with vinCRIStine overdose. In two children with vinCRIStine overdose, double volume exchange transfusion decreased vinCRIStine concentration by more than 50%, in a third child virtually no vinCRIStine was removed. Treatment was started within 6 hours of exposure.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. Patients with a vinCRIStine overdose need to be admitted. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs and neurologic function (hourly for the first 24 hours), CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved, along with monitoring of gastrointestinal function, serum electrolytes, and hepatic enzymes. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in a health care facility for a minimum of 72 hours after overdose. If neurologic effects are pronounced the patient should remain in a health care facility longer, based on clinical judgement, due to delayed onset of coma and seizures following large overdoses. Patients with myelosuppression should remain hospitalized until counts begin to recover. CONSULT CRITERIA: IMMEDIATELY consult a neurosurgeon if intrathecal exposure has occurred or is suspected. Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with a vinCRIStine overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with an intrathecal exposure or profound neurotoxicity should be transferred to an intensive care setting.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"e4ios12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>VINCRISTINE<\/b><br\/> TOXICITY: A minimum lethal or maximum tolerated dose is not well established. Severe symptoms should be anticipated in patients after single intravenous doses of 3 mg\/m(2) or more in adults and 3 to 4 mg\/m(2) in patients under 13 years of age.  Fatalities have been reported in children after an IV vinCRIStine overdose of: 13.5 mg in a 7-year-old (intended dose 1.35 mg), 7.5 mg (7.5 mg\/m(2)) in a 5-year-old, and 32 mg in a 13-year-old. INTRAVENOUS INFUSION: Mild to moderate toxicity (ie, neurologic {paraesthesia, diminished reflexes} and hematologic {decrease WBC and platelets) developed following a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.5 and 0.75 mg\/m(2) daily for 5 days; severe toxicity (ie, myelosuppression {leukopenia}, autonomic neuropathy {ileus, urinary retention}, hyponatremia, marked muscle weakness) occurred in patients receiving 1 mg\/m(2) daily for 5 days. ADULT: An adult survived a vinCRIStine dose of 25 mg IV; paresthesia remained 6 months after exposure. Another adult recovered completely after receiving cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide 6000 mg, doxorubicin 420 mg, and vinCRIStine 12 mg over 5 consecutive days. PEDIATRIC: One child survived an overdose of 8.75 mg as a single dose and another survived a dose of 9 mg\/m(2) over 6 days with supportive care. INTRATHECAL EXPOSURE: VinCRIStine is usually FATAL if given intrathecally. Fatal intrathecal doses have ranged from 0.3 to 3 mg vinCRIStine. Of the patients who survived, all sustained some degree of permanent neurologic injury. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: GENERAL: Varies with disease state. Dose limit is dependent on the patient and protocol being used. Maximum dose should not exceed 2 mg\/wk IV due to vinCRIStine-related neurotoxicities. ADULT: USUAL DOSE: 1.4 mg\/m(2)\/wk IV. PEDIATRIC: USUAL DOSE: 1.5 to 2 mg\/m(2)\/wk IV. For patients weighing 10 kg or less: 0.05 mg\/kg\/wk IV. HIGH DOSE THERAPY: In one study, a total dose of 3.5 mg\/m(2) administered over 4 days was well tolerated in select patients prior to autologous marrow rescue. <br\/>"}]},{"id":"e4ios13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Advise patient to avoid vaccines during therapy due to drug-induced immunosuppression.<\/li><li>Instruct both male and female patients to use reliable contraception, as drug may cause fetal harm if pregnancy occurs during treatment.
