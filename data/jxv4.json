It is also approved for the prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax, when alternative therapies are unavailable or not appropriate. PHARMACOLOGY: Raxibacumab is a human IgG (lambda) monoclonal antibody, with no direct antibacterial activity, that binds to the protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus (B) anthracis. The binding of raxibacumab to the PA of B anthracis prevents intracellular entry of anthrax lethal factor and edema factor, the enzymatic toxin components responsible for the pathogenic effects of anthrax toxin. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose has not been reported. TOXICITY: There have been no reports of overdose. Signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are anticipated to be similar to excessive pharmacologic adverse events. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects reported in at least 1.5% of patients during clinical trials were rash, pruritus, pain in the extremity, and somnolence. INFREQUENT: Other adverse effects that occurred in less than 1.5% of patients, but at a higher rate than in patients receiving a placebo, include palpitations, vertigo, anemia, leukopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, peripheral edema, increased blood amylase and creatine phosphokinase concentrations, back pain, muscle spasms, vasovagal syncope, insomnia, flushing, and hypertension.<br\/>"},{"id":"jxv4s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RAXIBACUMAB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Significant toxicity is not expected after raxibacumab overdose. In the event of an infusion reaction, decrease rate of infusion or discontinue infusion entirely; administer antihistamines, acetaminophen, and corticosteroids as indicated.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary as raxibacumab is administered intravenously.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary unless other toxic agents have been administered concurrently.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Monitor dermal injection sites for irritation or hypersensitivity reactions. Monitor for infusion reaction (rash, pruritus, flushing). Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unlikely that hemodialysis would be useful after overdose because of the size of raxibacumab (molecular weight 146 kilodaltons).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management; raxibacumab is generally only used in the hospital setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be observed for several hours after overdose until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or for whom diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxv4s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>RAXIBACUMAB<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established.
