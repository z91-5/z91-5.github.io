It has previously been used in small doses as a topical anesthetic for oral or pharyngeal pain. PHARMACOLOGY: It suppresses cough by its topical anesthetic action on respiratory stretch receptors. TOXICOLOGY: As its structure is very similar to other local anesthetics, such as procaine and tetracaine, it is thought that its toxic effects, especially to the central nervous and cardiovascular systems is caused by sodium channel blockade (as with other local anesthetics). EPIDEMIOLOGY: There are at least a few hundred exposures to benzonatate every year; the majority of these have minor or no effects, but a few deaths have been reported. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients with mild exposures will only exhibit the normal effects of the drug (ie, local anesthesia of the exposed area) which will most commonly occur in the oropharyngeal region due to oral ingestion. There is a small subset of the population that might experience a hypersensitivity reaction to benzonatate or the compounds used in its formulation; in such cases, one might see a local reaction such as a rash to the exposed area. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is rare (occurring in 1% or less of patients), but can result in death. Significant clinical effects include tachycardia, agitation, seizures, coma, ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, hypotension and asystole. Fatalities tend to be secondary to cardiac dysrhythmias rather than seizures, though cases of status epilepticus have been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects (1% to 10% of users) may include the following: sedation, headache, rash, constipation, nausea, vomiting, GI upset, chest numbness, burning sensation in the eyes and nasal congestion. <br\/>"},{"id":"1i3is12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BENZONATATE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The majority of benzonatate exposures require only supportive care. If patients present soon after exposure, activated charcoal may be considered; however, as the drug is rapidly absorbed and there is a risk of seizures after exposure, one should only give charcoal, if the patient is alert, can protect the airway, and the exposure has just recently occurred. The majority of these exposures will have mild symptoms only (ie, local anesthesia to the oropharynx) and require only observation to ensure patients do not choke or go on to have severe toxicity. For those experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to benzonatate or the compounds related to it formulation, treatment should be stand decontamination (such as washing with soap and water) and other standard medications used to treat allergic reactions (eg, antihistamines and steroids). MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with CNS depression, recurrent seizures or hemodynamic instability require early intubation. Treat QRS widening or ventricular dysrhythmias initially with sodium bicarbonate, 1 to 2 mEq\/kg initial dose. Monitor arterial blood gases and serial ECG, maintain pH between 7.45 to 7.55. Follow ACLS protocol for ventricular dysrhythmias not responsive to bicarbonate. Consider lipid emulsion, initial bolus of 1.5 mL\/kg over 1 minute. Follow with an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min for 30 to 60 minutes. Repeat the bolus injection twice at 5 minute intervals if adequate circulation has not been restored. After 5 minutes increase the infusion rate to 5 mL\/kg\/min if adequate circulation has not been restored. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines, if seizures persist or recur add propofol or barbiturates. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Wash with soap and water. If a patient experiences a hypersensitivity reaction, treat with antihistamines and steroids. OCULAR EXPOSURE: Irrigate with water.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital activated charcoal should generally be avoided because of the risk of seizures and subsequent aspiration Wash exposed skin and irrigate exposed eyes with water. HOSPITAL: Consider using activated charcoal if the ingestion was large and relatively recent (within in an hour) and the patient is alert and able to protect the airway and tolerate liquids.<\/li><li>Airway management: The majority of these exposures should not require any emergent airway management. Patients with recurrent seizures, dysrhythmias or hemodynamic instability require early endotracheal intubation.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no universally accepted antidote for benzonatate overdoses. However, 20% lipid emulsion solutions have been used for episodes of cardiac toxicity for other local anesthetics, and may be a reasonable therapy in cases of cardiac toxicity from benzonatate. Lipid Emulsion: Dose: Initial bolus: 1.5 mL\/kg over 1 minute. Follow with an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min for 30 to 60 minutes. Repeat the bolus injection twice at 5 minute intervals if adequate circulation has not been restored. After 5 minutes increase the infusion rate to 5 mL\/kg\/min if adequate circulation has not been restored.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor neurologic status and ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. In asymptomatic, inadvertent ingestions with no or mild symptoms, no laboratory studies, are needed. However, any intentional overdoses merit a standard overdose panel of labs: metabolic panel, acetaminophen and salicylate level and ECG. Benzonatate levels can be obtained at specialized labs, but are not clinically useful to manage a patient.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no evidence for the use of enhanced elimination techniques such as dialysis, hemoperfusion urinary alkalinization or multiple dose activated charcoal for benzonatate exposures.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of an extra dose or two can be managed at home. Asymptomatic children with ingestions of a single perle (100 mg) can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All intentional exposures, symptomatic patients and all children with ingestions of more than a single 100 mg perle should be sent to a health care facility. Observation should occur for at least 4 to 6 hours or until patient's symptoms show clear improvement. If patients are asymptomatic for 4 to 6 hours or show clear improvement during observation, they may be discharged home or cleared for psychiatric evaluation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Most patients should not need admission to the hospital unless they exhibit severe toxicity (seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias). If patients do exhibit such severe symptoms they should be admitted to the ICU. Criteria for hospital discharge include return to baseline functioning or clear improvements from potential complications of their toxicity. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for patients with severe toxicity or in who the diagnosis is uncertain. Neurologists, cardiologists and critical care physicians may need to be involved in patients who exhibit severe toxicity.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"1i3is12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>BENZONATATE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Mild toxicity may occur with a single ingestion of a 100 mg capsule, especially in pediatric patients less than 6 years old.
