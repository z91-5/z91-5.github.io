PHARMACOLOGY: Bisphosphonates have a high affinity for mineralized bone and inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption resulting in a net gain in bone mass. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose of this medication is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate toxicity of bisphosphonates have resulted in hypocalcemia, paresthesia, hypotension, fever, and vomiting. SEVERE TOXICITY: Acute renal failure and death have been reported following high dose administration of tiludronate (800 mg\/day IV for 2 days). ADVERSE EFFECTS: Dose-dependent upper gastrointestinal irritation (ie, esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, erosions, and dysphagia) is common. Asymptomatic decreases in calcium and phosphate may develop.
