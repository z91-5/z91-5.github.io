EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Fatigue and hypertension were reported in patients receiving 2,000 mg daily and 1,000 mg daily, respectively. SEVERE POISONING: Severe toxicity following overdose has not been reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses, and may include myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, and possibly QTc prolongation, bleeding and hepatotoxicity. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects following therapeutic administration include: bone marrow suppression (i.e., leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), hypertension, hair depigmentation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. RARE: QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, hemorrhagic events (i.e., pulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cerebral hemorrhage), and severe hepatotoxicity, with fatalities, have been rarely reported with pazopanib therapy.<br\/>"},{"id":"929511-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PAZOPANIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat severe hypertension with nitroprusside as the preferred agent; nitroglycerin or phentolamine as alternatives. QT prolongation and torsades de pointes have been reported with therapeutic doses and may occur following overdose. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate and correct electrolyte abnormalities; use overdrive pacing. Hemorrhagic events (pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary) have been observed. Myelosuppression has been reported. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (e.g., filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients who are awake and able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain airway or if airway is protected.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension does not usually require treatment.
