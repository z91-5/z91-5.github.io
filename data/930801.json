PHARMACOLOGY: Riociguat stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which is a nitric oxide receptor and an enzyme found in the cardiopulmonary system. Nitric oxide binds sGC and it catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Riociguat stimulates the nitric oxide-sGC-cGMP pathway, which leads to increased generation of cGMP and subsequent vasodilation. TOXICOLOGY: Increased intracellular cGMP can cause vasodilation of the systemic vasculature and hypotension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is rare and overdose has not been reported. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Little data available. Hypotension, headache, nausea and vomiting would be expected. SEVERE TOXICITY: Has not been reported. Severe hypotension with end organ effects such as syncope or acute kidney injury, and severe hemorrhage are theoretically possible. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Headache, dyspepsia, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, anemia, hemorrhage, gastroesophageal reflux and constipation have been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"930801-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RIOCIGUAT<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Care is symptomatic and supportive. Administer antiemetics for nausea\/vomiting. Treat mild hypotension with intravenous fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat hypotension with intravenous fluids; add vasopressors if necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Consider activated charcoal in patients with recent, substantial ingestions who are alert and can protect their airway.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Treat with intravenous fluids. Add vasopressors (dopamine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine) if hypotension persists.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, particularly blood pressure. Monitor CBC. In patients who develop hypotension, monitor serum electrolytes and renal function. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. Obtain a pregnancy test on any exposed woman of childbearing potential. Riociguat concentrations are not widely available or useful to guide therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit because of the high degree of protein binding (95%). Hemoperfusion or plasmapheresis might be useful as riociguat has a small volume of distribution (30 L), but this has not been described. These modalities may be considered in patients with severe overdose not responding to supportive care.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestion of a single extra dose can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All children, symptomatic patients, deliberate ingestions and adults ingesting more than a single extra dose should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop hypotension or other persistent signs or symptoms of toxicity should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Exposed pregnant women should be referred to a specialist in teratogenesis.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930801-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>RIOCIGUAT<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Toxic dose is unknown.
