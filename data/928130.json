At the time of this review, telithromycin is the only drug in this class of antibiotics that has been FDA approved. A second drug, cethromycin, is currently in clinical trials. PHARMACOLOGY: Telithromycin, a ketolide antibiotic, is structurally related to the macrolide antibiotics. It binds domains II and V of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, thereby blocking protein synthesis. It retains gram-positive activity in the presence of methylase-mediated domain V alteration by binding at domain II. In addition, telithromycin may prevent emerging ribosomal subunit assembly. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data is limited. Doses up to 2400 mg have caused taste disturbance, blurred vision, headache, diarrhea, nausea, tinnitus, confusion, and transient increases in serum aminotransferase levels in healthy subjects. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. OTHER EFFECTS: Taste disturbance, blurred vision, diplopia, and difficulty in focusing, abdominal pain, elevated liver enzymes, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, leukopenia, thrombocytosis, acute allergic reactions. QTc prolongation, torsades de pointes, and atrial dysrhythmias have rarely been reported. Severe hepatotoxicity resulting in death has also been infrequently reported. Reactions such as fulminant hepatitis, hepatic necrosis leading to liver transplant, acute hepatic failure, and some fatal cases of severe hepatic injury have occurred during or immediately after treatment. In some cases, progress of liver injury was rapid, occurring after treatment with a few telithromycin doses. Most cases of hepatic dysfunction occurring during clinical trials and in postmarketing reports were mild to moderate and generally reversible. Severe hepatic reactions have sometimes been associated with serious underlying diseases or concurrent medications.  Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported with telithromycin therapy. Patients with myasthenia gravis experienced increased muscle weakness, dyspnea, and severe acute respiratory failure within a few hours after ingestion of the first dose of telithromycin. <br\/>"},{"id":"928130-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>KETOLIDE ANTIBIOTICS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Acute toxicity, other than gastrointestinal discomfort, is not common. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. QT prolongation and torsades de pointes have been reported with therapeutic doses and may occur following overdose. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate and correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is not expected after an overdose; prehospital decontamination is generally NOT necessary. HOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is not expected after an overdose. Gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely warranted. Consider activated charcoal after extremely large ingestions or those involving toxic coingestants.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect their airway, or if unstable dysrhythmias or severe acute allergic reactions develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, and\/or atrial overdrive pacing.

MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULTS: 2 g IV over 1 to 2 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILDREN: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with severe vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor liver enzymes, particularly in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring following a significant exposure. QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes have been reported with therapy and may occur with overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: The effectiveness of hemodialysis following ketolide antibiotic overdose is unknown. It is unlikely to be useful given the large volume of distribution of telithromycin (2.9 L\/kg).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patient with inadvertent ingestions who have minimal symptoms can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance, QTc prolongation or cardiovascular instability should be admitted.
