Tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain have been reported. Lactic acidosis has been occurred after acute overdoses with sustained release products. Severe hypotension has been reported following a massive niacin overdose (11,000 milligrams). Elevated hepatic enzymes have developed following overdose. Laboratory findings have also included hypo- and hyperglycemia and coagulopathy in some exposures. A teenager developed a prolonged QTc interval after ingesting 5.5 grams of niacin. ADVERSE EVENTS: Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are frequent symptoms after oral niacin therapy. Other adverse effects include dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, chills, edema, syncope, dryness of the skin, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, stimulation of peptic ulcer, amblyopia, jaundice and elevated hepatic enzymes, decrease in glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia. Significant toxicity has been reported in a small number of patients following the use of niacin to interfere with urine drug screening.<br\/>"},{"id":"404120-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>NIACIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Decontamination:  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not required after acute overdose of immediate release products.

After ingesting 11,000 mg of niacin within a 12-hour period, a 56-year-old man developed severe, persistent hypotension (BP 58\/40 mmHg) in the absence of cutaneous flushing. Following supportive therapy, he recovered completely. A 16-year-old girl developed epigastric discomfort and rash after taking 330 mg of niacin daily (more than 25 times the recommended daily allowance for a teenager).  Symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. Two teenagers developed hepatotoxicity and acidosis after ingestion of 5 and 6 g of sustained-release niacin over a 48-hour period.
