Linaclotide and the active metabolite bind to GC-C of the luminal surface of intestinal epithelium. Binding of linaclotide and the active metabolite activates GC-C, which in turn, increases intracellular and extracellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevated intracellular cGMP stimulates the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen, causing an increase in intestinal fluid and faster transit.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"930279-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"930279-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Bioavailability, Oral: low<\/li><li>Effect of food: unknown<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"930279-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Gastrointestinal tract: primary route<\/li><li>Principal peptide metabolite: active<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"930279-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Fecal: 3% to 5%; changed <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"930279-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>administer 30 minutes prior to first meal of the day<\/li><li>swallow whole; do not break or chew<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"930279-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"no specific monitoring has been determined<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"930279-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Linzess<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 145 MCG, 290 MCG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"930279-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Instruct patient to not allow children under 18 years of age access to the drug, as harm may result if they take the drug.<\/li><li>This drug may cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, or headache.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report severe diarrhea, especially if accompanied by hematochezia or melena.<\/li><li>Patient should swallow capsule whole once daily on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
