Seizures have developed after parenteral overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may commonly occur with therapy; oral exposures are less likely to cause severe allergic reactions than parenteral exposures. Seizures have also been reported following therapeutic administration. Prolonged prothrombin times, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathies associated with a qualitative platelet defect and aggregation abnormalities have been reported following IV cephalosporin therapy. Pseudocholelithiasis may follow intravenous administration of ceftriaxone.

Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). For large overdoses, consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr).
