Common medications include oxymetazoline, tetrahydrozoline, and naphazoline. Surreptitious oral administration of these agents has been reported to facilitate sexual abuse in both adults and children. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents bind to peripheral alpha adrenergic receptors at the site of action (the eye or nose) causing vasoconstriction. TOXICOLOGY: They stimulate the central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors resulting in a net sympatholytic effect. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Uncommon poisoning which can theoretically result in significant morbidity, especially in children although it is very rare to see more than minimal effects. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tachycardia, agitation, pallor, diaphoresis, somnolence, ataxia. SEVERE TOXICITY: Coma, hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, apnea, hypothermia, hyporeflexia. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Headache, nervousness, nausea, dizziness. Rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa) has been described with prolonged use (greater than 5 days).<br\/>"},{"id":"599960-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IMIDAZOLINE DECONGESTANTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Management is primarily supportive. Initially, toxicity may manifest more as peripheral alpha effects causing generalized peripheral vasoconstriction. Agitation has also been described. These effects generally do not require therapy. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Management is primarily supportive. Manifestations are primarily due to central alpha effects. The main concerns in a serious overdose are CNS depression with loss of airway reflexes and respiratory depression. Supplemental oxygen should be administered as necessary. Intubation may be required for children who are severely depressed. Hypotension generally responds to intravenous fluid support only, but uncommonly may require a vasopressor such as dopamine. Hypertension is generally transient and does not require treatment. However, if there are signs of end organ compromise from hypertension, a short-acting antihypertensive (ie, nitroprusside or phentolamine) can be used with close monitoring since hypotension often follows the hypertension. Although there are reports suggesting that naloxone can reverse toxicity from clonidine (a drug with a mechanism of action similar to imidazolines), the use of naloxone for imidazoline poisoning is even less well characterized and cannot be routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Decontamination is unlikely to be of benefit in these cases since these are primarily liquid ingestions which will be absorbed quickly. In addition, these agents may cause CNS depression, so the risk of decontamination generally exceeds any potential benefit. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is unlikely to be of benefit in these cases since these are primarily liquid ingestions which will be absorbed quickly. In addition, patients (children in particular) may become lethargic quickly.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who are comatose or with altered mental status may need mechanical respiratory support and orotracheal intubation.<\/li><li>Antidote: There are no specific antidotes. Although there are reports suggesting that naloxone can reverse toxicity from clonidine (a drug with a mechanism of action similar to imidazolines), the use of naloxone for imidazoline poisoning is even less well characterized and cannot be routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl 10 to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Generally hypertension is transient and does not warrant treatment. If severe, short acting agents (ie, nitroprusside or phentolamine) should be used.<\/li><li>Bradycardia: Treatment is only indicated in symptomatic patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. Atropine is the first line therapy. Atropine - Adult - 0.5 mg to 1 mg IV, repeat every 5 minutes if bradycardia persists. Pediatric - 0.02 mg\/kg IV or intraosseously.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific lab work (CBC, electrolytes, urinalysis) is required. Consider arterial or venous blood gas measurements in serious cases. Obtain an ECG in symptomatic patients. Obtain a CT scan in patients with profound CNS depression to evaluate for other causes.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Enhanced elimination has no role in these ingestions.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Any adult with an intentional ingestion or a symptomatic child should be referred to a healthcare facility. Young children have developed serious adverse effects after ingesting as little as 1 to 2 mL of formulations of eye drops or nasal spray (concentrations not specified) containing imidazoline decongestants (eg, tetrahydrozoline, oxymetazoline, or naphazoline). OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be observed for a minimum of 6 hours after a suspected ingestion and can be discharged if asymptomatic after that time. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients should be admitted to a monitored setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing severe poisonings.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"599960-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>IMIDAZOLINE DECONGESTANTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose after oral ingestions is not clear, but young children have developed serious adverse effects after ingesting as little as 1 to 2 mL of formulations of eye drops or nasal spray containing imidazoline decongestants (eg, tetrahydrozoline, oxymetazoline, or naphazoline).
