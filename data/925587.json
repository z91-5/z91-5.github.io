It is also indicated for controlling hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adults with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance, and have failed surgery or are ineligible for surgery; it should not be used in patients with type 2 diabetes unless it is associated with Cushing's syndrome. Mifepristone has also been used in a variety of conditions, including dilation of cervical canal, emergency contraception, and ovarian cancer. PHARMACOLOGY: Mifepristone competitively inhibits the actions of progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites, resulting in termination of pregnancy. The combination of mifepristone and misoprostol causes expulsion of the products of conception through decidual necrosis, myometrial contractions, and cervical softening. TOXICOLOGY:  Mifepristone possesses antiglucocorticoid activity, with approximately the same affinity for glucocorticoid receptors as dexamethasone. The drug has also demonstrated the ability to abolish the negative feedback control of cortisol on the pituitary-adrenal axis and to inhibit the ACTH inhibitory activity of dexamethasone, which may result in adrenal failure following administration of massive doses of mifepristone. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. In tolerance studies, no serious adverse reactions were observed in healthy non-pregnant women and healthy men in single doses greater than 3-fold the recommended doses for termination of pregnancy. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Uterine bleeding (may be severe), abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, back pain.

Patients may only need observation. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive care is the mainstay of treatment. Treat severe hypotension with fluids and vasopressors if necessary. Severe uterine bleeding, necessitating blood transfusions and curettage in some instances, may occur following therapeutic administration of mifepristone as sole therapy or in combination therapy with prostaglandin or misoprostol administration. Consultation should be made with obstetrics and gynecology in cases of uterine hypertonicity or bleeding after ingestion.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is large, recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.

Pregnant patients with symptoms of vaginal bleeding or contractions should be evaluated by an obstetrician\/gynecologist. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.
