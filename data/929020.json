It is also approved for maintaining clinical response and reducing signs and symptoms of moderate to severe Crohn's disease in adults who had inadequate response to conventional therapy. PHARMACOLOGY: Certolizumab pegol is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (specifically TNF-alpha), which results in an interference in the production of downstream inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor, and nitric oxide. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is very rare. TOXICITY: There are no reports of toxicity following acute overdose. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Upper respiratory infections (eg; nasopharyngitis, laryngitis, viral infection), urinary tract infections (eg; bladder infection, bacteriuria, cystitis), and arthralgia. LESS COMMON: Although the causal relationship to certolizumab pegol is not clear, the following adverse reactions were reported during studies of patients receiving certolizumab pegol therapy: angina pectoris, dysrhythmias, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, bleeding and injection site reaction, alopecia totalis, dermatitis, erythema nodosum, urticaria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, nephrotic syndrome, renal failure, optic neuritis, uveitis, retinal hemorrhage, anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, lymphadenopathy, thrombophilia, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, seizure, peripheral neuropathy, and anxiety.
