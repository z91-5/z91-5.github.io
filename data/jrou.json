PHARMACOLOGY: Isoniazid interferes with enzymes that help produce mycobacterial cell walls.  TOXICOLOGY:  Isoniazid causes a functional deficiency of pyridoxine by increasing its elimination and decreasing its conversion to the active form.  The resulting deficiency of pyridoxine leads to decrease in GABA formation.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Uncommon exposure which can result in significant morbidity and death. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Vomiting, slurred speech, dizziness, and tachycardia.  These signs may represent early signs of toxicity which may then progress, rather than mild toxicity.  SEVERE TOXICITY: Seizures, which are classically intractable to traditional treatment, severe lactic acidosis, coma, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and hypotension may occur. Elevations in hepatic enzymes to fulminant hepatic failure (rare) have developed in overdose. Persisting dementia has also been reported following acute overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Peripheral neuropathy is the most common side effect of isoniazid and is often preceded by paresthesias of the hands and feet. The side effects appear to be dose-related and occur more in the malnourished, patients with risk factors for neuritis (eg, alcoholism, diabetes), and in patients who are slow-inactivators. Other neurotoxic effects (uncommon) include seizures, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and atrophy, memory impairment, and toxic psychosis. Isoniazid can cause an idiosyncratic hepatitis with therapeutic use.  Toxicity can range from mild asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to fulminant hepatic failure. The following adverse effects have also been reported following therapeutic use of isoniazid: Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, pancreatitis, agranulocytosis, hemolytic, sideroblastic, or aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, hypersensitivity reactions, fever, rash, anaphylactic reactions, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis, pyridoxine deficiency, pellagra, hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, gynecomastia, rheumatic syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome.<br\/><\/li><li><b>RIFAMPIN <\/b><br\/>USES: Rifampin is used to treat all forms of tuberculosis. The initial phase of therapy consists of a 3-drug regimen that includes rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide that is administered for 2 months, followed by maintenance therapy with rifampin and isoniazid for at least 4 months. PHARMACOLOGY: Rifampin, a semisynthetic macrocyclic antibiotic derivative of rifamycin SV (derived from Streptomyces mediterranei), inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. It can interact with bacterial RNA polymerase. Disruption of RNA synthesis interrupts protein synthesis, leading to cell death. However, it does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. TOXICOLOGY: The mechanism of toxicity for rifamycin derivatives remains unknown. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Fatalities have occurred in both adults and children; the minimum lethal dose appears to be highly variable and may depend on underlying comorbidities (ie, hepatic insufficiency). MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients are likely to present with nausea and vomiting; the vomitus may appear orange to red in color. Other symptoms include: abdominal pain, pruritus, headache, and increasing lethargy. Brownish-red or orange discoloration of the skin and bodily fluids (ie, urine, sweat, saliva, tears, and feces) can develop quickly following overdose; the degree of discoloration appears to be dose-dependent. Transient alterations in liver enzymes and bilirubin levels may be observed. Facial and\/or periorbital edema have been observed in some adults and children following overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hepatotoxicity (ie, liver enlargement, tenderness, elevated  liver enzyme and bilirubin concentrations) can develop after a severe overdose. Symptoms may be more severe in patients with a history of impaired liver function. Jaundice may develop soon after severe exposure. A large ingestion can rarely result in seizures, hypotension, dysrhythmias, pulmonary edema, cardia arrest and death. ADVERSE EVENTS: Nausea, vomiting, jaundice, diarrhea, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, mental confusion and mild, self-limited cutaneous reactions (flushing and itching with or without a rash) have been observed with therapy. Other events may include: flushing and itching of the skin with or without a rash (typically not a hypersensitivity reaction), visual disturbances, fever, muscular weakness, pain in extremities, and generalized numbness. Laboratory findings may demonstrate transient abnormalities in liver function tests (eg, elevated serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases), leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and decreased hemoglobin, and elevations in BUN and serum uric acid. INFREQUENT: Thrombocytopenia has been observed in patients receiving intermittent high-dose therapy. RARE: Agranulocytosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, hematuria, acute renal failure, psychoses, anaphylaxis have been reported rarely with therapy. CHRONIC USE: Hepatitis and jaundice may be noted following chronic therapeutic administration of rifamycin antibiotics and is most notable in patients with chronic liver disease, alcoholism, and old age.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jrous12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ISONIAZID <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Adult patients who present within 2 hours after a large ingestion should be given a prophylactic dose of pyridoxine. Intravenous access should be established and the patient should be placed in a resuscitation-ready room. Seizures may be the presenting sign of ingestion and represent a more severe poisoning. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY:  Intractable seizures are the hallmark of severe isoniazid ingestions. Following adequate airway, respiratory, and circulatory support, primary treatment is aimed at terminating seizure activity. The patient should receive intravenous pyridoxine on a gram for gram basis of isoniazid ingested or 5 grams empirically for unknown doses. Standard anticonvulsant therapy is likely to be of marginal benefit as sole treatment, but benzodiazepines or barbiturates may act synergistically with pyridoxine and should be administered as well. Sodium bicarbonate can be administered for severe metabolic acidosis. Coma should be treated with standard supportive care.  Administration of pyridoxine may reverse isoniazid-induced coma. Initially treat hypotension with 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. If necessary, add dopamine or norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Because of the risk of seizures and aspiration, prehospital decontamination should generally be avoided. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal and orogastric lavage should be used with caution because of the risk of seizures and subsequent risk of pulmonary aspiration.  They should only be used in patients who present soon after an ingestion and who have adequate airway protection.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who are comatose or with altered mental status generally need tracheal intubation and mechanical respiratory support.<\/li><li>Antidote: Pyridoxine can be used to reverse the isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency, which can terminate seizures and may be helpful in reversing isoniazid-induced coma. Treatment is on a gram-for-gram basis for the amount of isoniazid ingested, up to a maximum of 5 grams, or an empiric dose of 5 grams for an unknown ingestion in an adult.  The pediatric dose is 70 mg\/kg.  The exact dosing regimen has not been established.  For patients actively seizing, pyridoxine can be given at a rate of 0.5 g\/min until the seizures stop or 5 g has given.  The remainder can then be given over 1 to 4 hours.  If seizures persist after the first dose, a second dose should be given. Oral pyridoxine can be administered via nasogastric tube if intravenous supplies are exhausted, but there is no data demonstrating the utility of oral pyridoxine for severe isoniazid toxicity.  Benzodiazepines and\/or barbiturate should also be administered to patients with seizures secondary to isoniazid overdose.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Isoniazid blood concentrations may be measured but are not clinically helpful in an acute setting. Monitor serum electrolytes, serum lactate, and venous or arterial blood gases. In patients with seizure, monitor renal function. Monitor CBC and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Monitor creatinine kinase if seizures are prolonged. An EEG may be necessary to rule out status epilepticus.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis can eliminate isoniazid but is rarely indicated.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME MANAGEMENT: Patients who intentionally ingest isoniazid should be referred to a health care facility. Asymptomatic unintentional ingestions of less than 20 mg\/kg can be watched at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA:  If patients are asymptomatic after 6 hours, they can be discharged after appropriate psychiatric clearance. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistently altered mental status, abnormal vital signs, or seizures should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing severe poisonings.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>RIFAMPIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea) should be anticipated. Administer IV fluids in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Antiemetics may be necessary to control severe nausea and vomiting. Monitor vital signs and assess liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Monitor neuro function; lethargy is an early finding. Reversible brownish-red or orange discoloration of the skin and bodily fluids is likely to occur and is dose-dependent. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Alterations in mental status may develop; symptoms may be significant in patients with underlying hepatic disease. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin levels until evidence of patient recovery. There have been rare reports of conduction abnormalities, hypotension, seizures and pulmonary edema following severe toxicity. Monitor vital signs, neuro status, obtain a baseline ECG and institute cardiac monitoring. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines, barbiturates as necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital GI decontamination is not recommended due to the potential for CNS depression. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal, if the ingestion is relatively recent and the patient is alert and able to protect their airway. Repeat administration of activated charcoal may be beneficial since rifamycin antibiotics undergo enterohepatic circulation. However, there are no clinical trials documenting the efficacy of this procedure. Gastric lavage may also be indicated following a significant recent (first 2 to 3 hours) ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary following mild to moderate toxicity. However, patients with severe toxicity may develop significant alterations in mental status, or other symptoms that may require intubation.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, hepatic enzymes, serum bilirubin concentration and INR in symptomatic patients; monitor until patient recovery. Obtain a baseline CBC following a significant overdose. Obtain a baseline ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with evidence of conduction abnormalities. Plasma rifampin levels may be useful to confirm overdoses, but are not readily available and are not useful in guiding therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Extracorporeal procedures are unlikely to be beneficial following overdose based on its protein binding and extensive volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic (other than mild nausea) child or adult with an inadvertent minor (1 or 2 pills) exposure may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children or adults who are symptomatic after inadvertent exposure should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Patients may be discharged to home after 6 hours, if symptoms improve after treatment and laboratory studies remain normal. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Call a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jrous12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>ISONIAZID<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Doses of 20 to 40 mg\/kg have resulted in seizures.
