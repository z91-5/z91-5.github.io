PHARMACOLOGY: Abiraterone acetate is metabolized to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor of 17 alpha-hydroxylase\/C 17, 20-lyase (CYP 17) which decreases androgen levels and deprives androgen-sensitive prostatic carcinomas. It accomplishes this by interfering with the CYP17-catalyzed reactions involved in the production of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. Inhibition of CYP17 can result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: At the time of this review, there is no acute overdose data available. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported: Joint swelling or discomfort, hypokalemia, edema, muscle discomfort, hot flush, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, cough, hypertension, dysrhythmias, urinary frequency, nocturia, dyspepsia, and upper respiratory tract infection, heart failure, chest pain, hypophosphatemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes. <br\/>"},{"id":"929889-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ABIRATERONE ACETATE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For severe hypertension with end organ effects, nitroprusside or phentolamine are preferred. Labetalol and nitroglycerin are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is alert and able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias or hemodynamic instability.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension does not usually require treatment. For severe hypertension with end organ effects, nitroprusside or phentolamine are preferred, with nitroglycerin or labetalol as alternatives.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring, obtain an ECG, and administer oxygen.  Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders.  Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, particularly in patients with underlying impaired cardiac function. Amiodarone should be used with caution if a substance that prolongs the QT interval and\/or causes torsades de pointes is involved in the overdose.  Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, serum electrolytes, and liver enzymes following significant overdose. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An adult with an inadvertent exposure of an extra dose, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility, as should women who are potentially pregnant. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.
