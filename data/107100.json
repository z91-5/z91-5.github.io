It has also been used to treat leukemia, lymphoma, and cancers of the lung, head and neck, breast, and cervix. PHARMACOLOGY: Carboplatin, like cisplatin, is a platinum coordination compound that has antineoplastic activity. It binds to DNA base pairs, forming inter- and intra-strand crosslinks leading to DNA strand breaks and inhibiting DNA synthesis. TOXICOLOGY: The disruption of DNA synthesis affects rapidly dividing cells first; myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity. In addition, pretreated patients with carboplatin are at greater risk of bone marrow suppression than naive patients. Hypersensitivity reactions may be observed in patients treated after several cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Inadvertent iatrogenic overdose is very rare, but has occurred. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea and vomiting, and less often diarrhea, may develop within hours. Transient renal insufficiency, mucositis, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia may develop within days. Myelosuppression develops within the first two weeks. Nadir occurs in about 21 to 28 days, but may be earlier after an overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe mucositis, diarrhea, and myelosuppression have been reported after large overdoses. Ototoxicity (ie, tinnitus, high-frequency deafness), and peripheral neuropathy (mostly sensorineuronal) may develop. Cortical blindness has been reported rarely following high doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea and vomiting, bone marrow suppression, renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia), and neurotoxicity (peripheral neuropathy, mostly sensorineuronal). OTHER EFFECTS: Diarrhea, constipation, rash, ototoxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, transient elevation of liver enzymes. Extravasation and necrosis have been reported in patients receiving carboplatin.<br\/>"},{"id":"107100-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CARBOPLATIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with normal saline 3 to 6 L per day. Target urine output to 1 to 3 mL\/kg\/hr. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with normal saline 3 to 6 L per day. Target urine output to 1 to 3 mL\/kg\/hr. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs. Emergent hemodialysis should be performed as early as possible in any patient with a significant overdose. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Inadvertent intrathecal injection has not been reported with carboplatin. The following information is derived from experience with other antineoplastics. After an overdose, keep the patient upright and immediately drain at least 20 mL of CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free saline). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 24 hours). Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Activated charcoal is not helpful as overdose most often occurs inadvertently by the IV route. For dermal exposures, clean skin with soap and water, and for eye exposures, flush with water.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with significant encephalopathy (agitation, delirium).<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. For example: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: In one study, all grade stomatitis (onset: day 11; range 1 to 35 days; duration: 15 days; range 4 to 46 days) developed in 93% of patients with AML after receiving idarubicin, etoposide, and carboplatin. Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with carboplatin overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Peripheral axonal neuropathy: Peripheral neurotoxicity should be anticipated in overdose. Monitor and treat symptoms as indicated.<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Elevate the affected area. One source recommended applying warm packs. Another source recommended cold compresses for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable). Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, mental status and perform repeated neurological examination. Carboplatin plasma concentrations are not clinically useful or readily available. Closely monitor renal function, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and urine output. Monitor CBC with differential daily until nadir has clearly been reached and marrow recovery has begun. Nadir occurs in about 21 to 28 days, but may be earlier after an overdose. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor visual acuity and hearing. Obtain baseline ophthalmologic evaluation and audiogram and repeat as necessary.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Carboplatin has a small volume of distribution and low protein binding; it is readily removed by hemodialysis. Emergent hemodialysis should be performed as early as possible in any patient with a significant overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with carboplatin overdose need to be admitted, as toxicity develops over several days. Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with carboplatin overdose. Consult a nephrologist for emergent dialysis. In addition, consultation with an infectious diseases physician with expertise in the management of neutropenic patients with infections is strongly recommended. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"107100-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CARBOPLATIN <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Expect toxicity in therapeutic dose.
