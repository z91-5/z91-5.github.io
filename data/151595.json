CycloSERINE is an analog of the amino acid D-alanine. It interferes with an early step in bacterial cell wall synthesis in the cytoplasm by competitive inhibition of 2 enzymes, L-alanine racemase, which forms D-alanine from L-alanine, and D-alanine-D-alanine synthetase, which incorporates  D-alanine into the pentapeptide necessary for peptidoglycan formation and bacterial cell wall synthesis.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"151595-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"151595-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Tmax: 3 to 4 hours.<\/li><li>Bioavailability: 70 to 90%<\/li><li>Effect of food: Reduced Cmax, Prolonged Tmax (high-fat meals)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"151595-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Cerebrospinal Fluid: 80% to 100% of serum concentration<\/li><li>Vd: 0.11 to 0.26 L\/kg<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"151595-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Hepatic: 35% <br\/>"},{"id":"151595-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Fecal: minimal<\/li><li>Renal: 50% to 70%<\/li><li>Renal Clearance: 0.11 to 0.013 L\/hour\/kg<\/li><li>Dialyzable: yes (hemodialysis)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"151595-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"10 to 25 hours <br\/>"}]},"10":{"id":"151595-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>serum drug levels; peak 20 to 35 mcg\/mL may provide optimal efficacy<\/li><li>improvement in signs and symptoms of infection may be indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>serum drug levels; periodically and at least at weekly in patients with renal dysfunction, total daily doses greater than 500 mg, or signs and symptoms of toxicity; to maintain levels less than 30 mcg\/mL<\/li><li>renal excretion; periodically<\/li><li>hematologic panel; periodically<\/li><li>hepatic function; periodically<\/li><li>neuropsychiatric status; at least monthly and more frequently if symptoms develop<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of CNS toxicity in patients receiving a total daily dose greater than 500 mg<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"151595-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 250 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Seromycin<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 250 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"151595-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patient should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination until drug effects are realized.<\/li><li>This drug may cause confusion, dizziness, headache, somnolence, or seizure.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report depression, suicidal ideation, or unusual changes in behavior.<\/li><li>Advise patients receiving daily doses greater than 500 mg to monitor for and report signs\/symptoms of CNS toxicity.<\/li><li>Patient should not drink alcohol while taking this drug.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
