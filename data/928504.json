PHARMACOLOGY: Ranolazine is a cardioselective antiischemic agent (piperazine  derivative) that modulates myocardial metabolism by partially inhibiting fatty acid oxidation, thereby increasing glucose oxidation and generating more adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per molecule of oxygen consumed. The antianginal and antiischemic action of ranolazine is not dependent upon heart rate or blood pressure reduction and does not increase myocardial workload. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited data. Anticipated effects following ranolazine overdose include dizziness, nausea\/vomiting, dose-dependent QT interval prolongation, diplopia, paresthesia, and confusion SEVERE TOXICITY: Limited data. Significant QT prolongation may develop, however, there is limited experience with high doses (greater than 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure. While the clinical significance of this effect is unknown with ranolazine, other drugs with this potential have been associated with torsades de pointes-type dysrhythmias and sudden death. Syncope with prolonged loss of consciousness may develop secondary to torsades do pointes. Cardiac dysrhythmias and significant alterations in CNS function may develop. ADVERSE EVENTS: Commonly reported adverse effects with therapeutic administration, include dizziness, headache, constipation, and nausea. Dose-dependent QT interval prolongation may occur with ranolazine therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"928504-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RANOLAZINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Obtain a baseline ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor vital signs and neuro status. IV fluids may be indicated to treat nausea and vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Limited experience. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring to assess for QT prolongation and potential torsades de pointes-type dysrhythmias and cardiac instability or alterations in perfusion. Monitor oxygenation and neuro function.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be indicated if the patient is alert and able to protect their airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal, if the ingestion is relatively recent and the patient is alert and able to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary following mild to moderate toxicity. However, patients with severe toxicity may develop cardiac toxicity or alterations in CNS function that may require intubation.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Institute continuous ECG monitoring and obtain an ECG; QT interval prolongation may occur. Monitor vital signs, oxygenation and neuro status. Monitor serum electrolytes (including magnesium and calcium) and renal function. Serum ranolazine levels are not clinically useful in managing overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of value due to high protein binding (62%) of ranolazine.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic adult with an inadvertent minor exposure may be monitored at home. Due to limited experience, a child with more than a minor exposure (500 mg) should be observed in a healthcare center. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. A patient with an inadvertent significant ingestion (1500 mg or more) should be monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients may be discharged to home, once they remain asymptomatic after treatment and cardiac monitoring remains normal. Observe patients for 7 to 12 hours (peak plasma concentration is reached between 2 and 5 hours). ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate treatment should be admitted.
