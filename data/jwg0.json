PHARMACOLOGY: Antagonism of the arginine vasopressin V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts causes an increase in urine water excretion resulting in increased free water clearance, decreased urine osmolality, and increased serum sodium concentrations. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Limited data. Overdose is rare and rarely causes significant toxicity. TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Toxic effects are generally mild to moderate. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: CONIVAPTAN: Infusion site reactions (eg, pain, erythema, phlebitis), orthostatic hypotension, hypokalemia, and headache are the most common adverse effects. TOLVAPTAN: Thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, polyuria, and hyperglycemia are the most common adverse effects.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility.
