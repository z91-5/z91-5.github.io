This management discusses non-selective MAOIs (eg, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine).  Drugs that are selective inhibitors of MAO-B (eg, selegiline) and those that are selective inhibitors of MAO-A (eg,  moclobemide) are discussed in separate managements. These agents appear to have less toxicity than irreversible non-selective MAOIs. For further information, please refer to \"Reversible MAO-A Inhibitors\" and \"MAO-B Inhibitors\" documents. PHARMACOLOGY:  First generation MAOIs non-selectively inhibit monoamine oxidase enzymes, increasing serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylethylamine, and dopamine. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) may be inhibited in the gastrointestinal tract where it limits metabolism of tyramine and decreases the concentration of tyramine in the systemic circulation.  Inhibition of MAO by these drugs is irreversible; effects persist for days to weeks after drug discontinuation. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicology is an extension of the pharmacology of MAOIs. Patients have a catecholamine excess which leads to a hyperadrenergic state\/sympathetic hyperactivity.  Toxicity generally occurs after an overdose or when MAOIs are combined with certain drugs (other drugs with MAO or serotonergic activity) or certain foods (tyramine reactions).  While tyramine reactions are serious, they are generally self-limited. Overdose is life-threatening. EPIDEMIOLOGY:  First generation MAOIs are rarely used and overdose is rare, but can be life-threatening. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY:  Tachycardia, mild hypertension, anxiety, flushing, and headache are common in mild to moderate toxicity.  Because MAO inhibition by these drugs is irreversible, drug or food interactions symptoms may develop days to weeks after discontinuation of therapy. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hyperadrenergic symptoms, such as severe tachycardia and hypertension, diaphoresis, delirium, seizures, dysrhythmias and possibly cardiovascular collapse and coma, may occur.  Hypertensive crisis can lead to intracranial hemorrhage, renal damage, and myocardial infarction.  Serotonin syndrome is a triad of autonomic instability (ie, hyperthermia, hypertension or hypotension), neuromuscular excitability (ie, clonus and rigidity), and altered mental status that may be thought of as a spectrum of symptoms.  Multiorgan failure and death may result from any of these complications. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported following MAOIs therapy: Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, fatigue, weakness, tremors, twitching, muscle spasm, myoclonic movements, hyperreflexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, tachycardia, hypertension, postural hypotension, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy (a dose-related side effect of phenelzine); RARE: anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia. Worsening of depression or suicidal ideation may occur during the therapeutic use of these agents. DRUG INTERACTIONS: The concurrent use of MAOIs and drugs that may augment catecholamine release (eg, pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine) may cause or exacerbate toxicity.  Serotonin syndrome may develop in patients taking MAOIs with other serotonergic agents such as illicit drugs (eg, ecstacy\/MDMA), medications (eg, dextromethorphan, SSRIs, meperidine), and herbal supplements (eg, St John's Wort). Drugs that are not typically considered MAOIs but have MAO inhibition properties, include the antibiotic linezolid, the herbal supplement St John's Wort, and the chemotherapeutic agent procarbazine.  When combined with other medications with MAOI activity, these may cause toxicity. FOOD INTERACTIONS: Foods containing high concentrations of tyramine may interact with MAOIs and cause serious reactions.  These foods include chocolate, certain aged cheeses, Chianti and other aged red wines, vermouth, avocado, pickled fish, broad beans, beers, liver, smoked or pickled meats, snails, and yeast extracts.  <br\/>"},{"id":"622240-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAO)<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treat anxiety, agitation, and tachycardia with benzodiazepines. Monitor the patient carefully for progression of symptoms. Symptoms and the potential for drug\/food interactions may persist for several weeks due to the irreversibility of MAO inhibition.  The offending agents should be discontinued and patient education involving drug and food interactions should be provided to all symptomatic patients. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Careful attention to the ABCs (airway, breathing and circulation) should guide symptomatic and supportive treatment, which is the mainstay of management of MAOI toxicity.  Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of coma or severe toxicity, especially for patients that are agitated with hyperthermia.  Recognition and aggressive treatment of agitation, hyperthermia, hypertension, seizures, end-organ damage and muscular rigidity is paramount. There is no antidote for MAOI toxicity.   Please see below for treatment of specific signs and symptoms.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: MAOI overdoses are life-threatening.  Induction of emesis is not recommended. Activated charcoal should be considered early in the course after a significant oral ingestion in patients that are protecting their airways and have not yet manifested signs of toxicity.  If a patient is displaying signs of toxicity, the risk of aspiration likely outweighs the potential benefit of charcoal. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be administered in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients who present within a few hours of ingestion, or in symptomatic patients who have a secure airway.  Gastric lavage may be considered for large overdoses who present within 1 hour of ingestion, though airway protection should be considered prior to the procedure.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (coma, respiratory depression, severe agitation).<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Psychomotor agitation: Liberal use of benzodiazepines is recommended until patient is mildly sedated.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: If hypertension persists after agitation is controlled with benzodiazepines, rapidly-acting, easily titrated vasodilators like nitroglycerin and nitroprusside should be used as these patients often cycle between hyper and hypotension.<\/li><li>Tachycardia: Tachycardia may occur from a combination of agitation and catecholamine release.  Treat with benzodiazepines.  Pure beta blockade is generally avoided in these patients as it may exacerbate hypertension.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Treat the patient aggressively with benzodiazapines and cooling if needed.  Cyproheptadine may be considered (seek guidance from a toxicologist prior to administering).<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: Hyperthermia can result from psychomotor agitation, increased neuromuscular activity or persistent seizures.  Sedate the patient with benzodiazepines (large doses may be required).  Other cooling measures can include cool mist and fans, cool packs in axilla and groin, or more aggressive cooling measures, such as ice baths, for severe hyperthermia.  Neuromuscular paralysis of the patient may be necessary.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Follow ACLS protocols.<\/li><li>Seizure: Treat seizures with intravenous benzodiazepines; add propofol and\/or barbiturates if necessary.  If seizures persist, intubate and paralyze the patient and institute barbiturate coma with continuous EEG monitoring.  Obtain a CT scan of head to rule out intracranial hemorrhage.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Mild orthostatic hypotension is common with therapeutic use.  Severe hypotension is rare but may occur as a late and ominous finding as a result of cardiovascular collapse.  Hypotension should be treated with an initial bolus of NS, if patient can tolerate a fluid load, then adrenergic vasopressors can be used to raise mean arterial pressure.  Direct agents (norepinephrine) are preferred to indirect agents (dopamine) because indirect pressors rely on catecholamine release from sympathetic neurons.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (especially blood pressure and temperature) and mental status. Institute continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring and obtain an ECG. MAOI plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available.  Screening urine toxicology immunoassays will not detect MAOIs. Helpful laboratory tests include basic chemistry profile, lactate, CPK, troponin, and coagulation panel. Consider a head CT and lumbar puncture to rule out intracranial mass, bleeding, or infection if the patient has altered mental status. Monitor liver enzymes, renal function, and serum electrolytes.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Home management is not recommended. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed.  Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than therapeutic dose, or if they are symptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or children with inadvertent ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for observation for development of toxicity.  After an overdose, clinical effects may be delayed up to 32 hours but are usually apparent within 24 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any patient with presumed overdose should be observed with cardiac monitoring for 24 hours due to the possibility of delayed toxicity.  Patients with significant persistent hypertension, hyperthermia, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, tachycardia or central nervous depression should be admitted to the ICU. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"622240-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAO)<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: MAOIs have very narrow therapeutic windows.
