PHARMACOLOGY: Adefovir is an acyclic nucleotide analogue of adenosine monophosphate. It is phosphorylated via cellular enzymes to active form, adefovir diphosphate, and inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine triphosphate and by causing DNA chain termination after its incorporation into viral DNA. Entecavir is a guanosine nucleoside analogue antiviral agent with selective activity against HBV polymerase. It is phosphorylated to active form, entecavir triphosphate and inhibits all three activities of the HBV polymerase (reverse transcriptase, rt): [1-base priming, 2-reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and 3-synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA] by competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate.  Telbivudine (beta-L-2'-deoxythymidine) is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analog with activity against hepatitis B virus by competitive inhibition of both viral reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase. Like other nucleoside analogues, the antiviral activity of telbivudine is dependent on its conversion intracellulary to telbivudine triphosphate. Once incorporated into viral DNA (anti-complement or second-strand DNA) by hepatitis B polymerase, DNA chain termination results. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: ADEFOVIR: Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported in patients following doses of adefovir dipivoxil 500 mg daily for 2 weeks and 250 mg daily for 12 weeks. ENTECAVIR: Healthy subjects who received single entecavir doses up to 40 mg or multiple doses up to 20 mg\/day for up to 14 days did not experience any unexpected adverse events. TELBIVUDINE: One patient received an unintentional overdose and was asymptomatic. The dose was not reported. No increase in or unexpected adverse effects were reported in healthy subjects who received 1800 milligram\/day for 4 days. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients taking nucleoside analogues alone or in combination with antiretroviral. ADEFOVIR: Asthenia, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, and dyspepsia have been reported in patients receiving adefovir in clinical trials. However, the incidence of these adverse events was similar in the placebo group.  Other adverse effects included rash, pruritus, vomiting, abnormal renal function, elevation in serum transaminases, cough, pharyngitis, sinusitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic failure, and fever. Nephrotoxicity has been reported during adefovir therapy, particularly using doses higher than 10 mg daily. It is characterized primarily by rises in serum creatinine and decreases in serum phosphorus levels; patients with underlying renal dysfunction are at greater risk. ENTECAVIR: COMMON: Headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. OTHER EFFECTS: Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, dyspepsia, vomiting, elevated serum amylase and lipase, hematuria, and photophobia. TELBIVUDINE: COMMON: Abdominal pain, transient increase in creatine kinase, myopathy, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, malaise, and fatigue. Increases in ALT as high as ten times the upper limit of normal have been reported but may have been associated with resistance.  Isolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported with postmarketing use of telbivudine. <br\/>"},{"id":"928395-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ANTIVIRAL NUCLEOSIDES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
