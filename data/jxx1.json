It is also indicated for the acute treatment of cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum. Pomalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, is used to treat patients with multiple myeloma who have received prior therapies (ie, lenalidomide and bortezomib) with evidence of disease progression. PHARMACOLOGY: The precise mechanism of thalidomide is not fully understood. It has immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, and antiangiogenic properties. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is uncommon due to restricted distribution; fatal overdoses have not been reported. TOXICOLOGY: Thalidomide should not be used by pregnant women, because it is a known teratogen that can cause severe birth defects or fetal death. OVERDOSE: Overdoses have been limited and have been followed by uneventful recoveries. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Acute toxicity is minimal, but may consist of hypotension, sedation, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, and dermatologic effects. SEVERE TOXICITY: Limited data. Sedation and peripheral neuropathy may occur. Severe hepatotoxicity may develop. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common adverse events include: fatigue, hypocalcemia, edema, constipation, neuropathy (sensory and motor), dyspnea, muscle weakness, leukopenia, neutropenia, rash, confusion, anorexia, nausea, anxiety\/agitation, asthenia, tremor, fever, weight loss, thrombosis\/embolism, weight gain, dizziness, and dry skin. Hepatotoxicity is rare. Teratogenicity has occurred.

Monitor vital signs and neuro status. Treat symptomatic hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor neuro status and vital signs; obtain a baseline CBC and electrolytes. Moderate to severe hypotension may require IV fluids, dopamine or norepinephrine. Treat symptomatic bradycardia with atropine. Monitor for hepatic insufficiency in a symptomatic patient.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Emesis is not recommended due to the risk of CNS depression. Activated charcoal may be indicated if the ingestion was recent and the patient is able to protect their airway. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be indicated if the ingestion was recent, and the airway can be protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary following a mild to moderate exposure; airway support may be needed following a severe exposure (eg, CNS depression, severe hypersensitivity reaction).<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Monitor blood pressure.

Assess for signs and symptoms of CNS depression and peripheral neuropathy. Obtain a pregnancy test in women of child bearing age because a single dose may be teratogenic.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be beneficial. These agents have a relatively high volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child with a minor exposure (one tablet) can be monitored at home. An asymptomatic adult taking an inadvertent extra dose of thalidomide can be monitored at home. However, because a single dose may be teratogenic, all women of childbearing potential who ingest thalidomide or pomalidomide should have a pregnancy test. OBSERVATION CRITERIA:  Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored for symptoms. Patients who exhibit only mild CNS depression or other signs of mild intoxication should be observed, either in the emergency department or as an inpatient, until no longer intoxicated. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent or ongoing symptoms should be admitted for further monitoring and supportive measures. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated by a mental health specialist. Any woman of child bearing age exposed to these agents should have a pregnancy test done due to the risk of severe birth defects and fetal death.
