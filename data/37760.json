less often for detoxification from opioid, ethanol, or nicotine. PHARMACOLOGY: Clonidine stimulates the presynaptic alpha-2 receptor in the brain, leading to inhibition of norepinephrine release, and it also stimulates the imidazoline receptor; both of these actions decrease sympathetic outflow. TOXICOLOGY: Stimulation of peripheral postsynaptic alpha-2 receptors after overdose can cause initial transient hypertension.  Excessive stimulation of presynaptic alpha-2 receptors in the lower brainstem and medulla decreases plasma norepinephrine concentrations, causing hypotension and bradycardia. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Clonidine ingestion is common, but severe poisoning is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: CNS depression, miosis, heart conduction abnormality, hypertension. SEVERE TOXICITY: Apnea, respiratory depression, coma, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, early transient hypertension. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Confusion, hallucinations, dry mouth, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, contact dermatitis, tinnitus, dizziness, nervousness, and sedation are the most common adverse effects.  Atrioventricular block, minor dysrhythmias, Raynaud phenomenon, and congestive heart failure are also reported.  Rebound hypertension develops with abrupt withdrawal.<br\/>"},{"id":"37760-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CLONIDINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: There is no specific treatment. Hypotension should be treated with intravenous boluses of crystalloid. Bradycardia is typically mild and usually doesn't require any treatment. Bradycardia, hypotension and CNS depression often respond to physical stimulation.  Naloxone has been used to reverse CNS depression with inconsistent success. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe bradycardia associated with hypotension and not responsive to physical stimulation should be treated with standard dose of atropine or cardiac pacing. Norepinephrine or dopamine may be beneficial in patients with severe bradycardia and hypotension not responding to physical stimulation, naloxone, intravenous crystalloid, and atropine. Patients with significant CNS and\/or respiratory depression should be intubated.  If hypertension is severe (associated with end organ effects) and prolonged, treatment should be initiated with an infusion of sodium nitroprusside.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is not recommended because of the potential risk of altered mental status. With dermal exposure, remove clonidine patches and wash exposed skin. HOSPITAL: Induced emesis and gastric lavage are not indicated. Activated charcoal binds clonidine and may be given for patients who present early after significant ingestions. Whole bowel irrigation should be used for symptomatic patients who have ingested a clonidine patch.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate patients with depressed mental status and who are unable to protect their airway and those with significant respiratory depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote for clonidine.   Although some patients have responded to naloxone (reversal of altered mental status, respiratory depression or apnea, and miosis), not all patients respond. Naloxone should be administered to patients with significant CNS or respiratory depression.  Tolazoline (an alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist) has been suggested as an antidote, but there is little clinical experience with its use and most patients do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Intrathecal overdose of clonidine has not been reported; however, clonidine can be administered intrathecally, therefore the potential for overdose exists. Support blood pressure with fluids and pressors. Intubate and ventilate as needed. Immediately empty the intrathecal pump. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage should be performed immediately followed by CSF exchange. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Clonidine is not routinely detected by the urine drug screen and the serum level is not clinically useful. Evaluation of respiratory function with pulse oximetry and cardiac function with ECG and frequent vital signs are important. Most patients with mild symptoms do not require additional testing.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Although clonidine has pharmacokinetic characteristics suggesting it is amenable to hemodialysis,  there is no clinical experience with its use, and overdose is rarely severe enough to warrant emergent hemodialysis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children with inadvertent clonidine tablet ingestions may be monitored at home if the ingestion is: Less than 0.1 mg clonidine for a child 4-years-old or younger, 0.2 mg clonidine or less in a child aged 5 to 8 years, or less than 0.4 mg clonidine in a child older than 8 years of age. Children taking clonidine therapeutically who inadvertently receive no more than double their therapeutic dose may be observed at home if asymptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions, children who have chewed or ingested clonidine patches or ophthalmic preparations, and children with tablet ingestions greater than the amounts listed above should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation and treatment. Most patients who ingest clonidine will manifest symptoms rapidly, typically within 30 to 90 minutes, so a 4-hour observation period is adequate for asymptomatic patients. Patients who ingest a clonidine patch may have delayed onset of symptoms. Following ingestion of extended-release formulations, onset of toxicity is expected to be delayed. Peak plasma concentrations of extended-release formulations are reached at about 7 to 8 hours after therapeutic doses; patients should be observed for the development of toxic effects for at least 9 to 14 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop even mild toxic effects after ingestion of sustained release formulations should be admitted to a monitored setting as more severe and prolonged toxicity may develop. Patients with bradycardia, CNS depression, respiratory depression, heart block, and hemodynamic instability or other serious symptoms should be admitted to an intensive care setting.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"37760-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CLONIDINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULTS: Mild toxicity may occur at just above the therapeutic range.
