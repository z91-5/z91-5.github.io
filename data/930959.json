It is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise. PHARMACOLOGY: Canagliflozin inhibits the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), which is expressed in the proximal renal tubules and is responsible for most renal reabsorption of filtered glucose. Inhibition of SGLT2 decreases reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, thus urinary glucose excretion is increased. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose has not been reported. OVERDOSE: Toxicity following overdose has not been reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects observed with canagliflozin therapy include urinary tract infections, polyuria, and female genital mycotic infections. LESS COMMON: Other adverse effects include hypotension, hypermagnesemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypersensitivity reaction, nausea, constipation, pancreatitis, and abdominal pain. Ingestion of canagliflozin alone is not expected to cause severe hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or insulin secretogogues hypoglycemia may develop. RARE: Phimosis has occurred in uncircumcised men treated with canagliflozin.<br\/><\/li><li><b>METFORMIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Oral hypoglycemic agents for type II diabetes mellitus. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents decrease hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and increase peripheral glucose uptake. TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after acute overdose, as they do not stimulate insulin release. Severe lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially fatal side effect mainly in patients with renal insufficiency, hepatic disease, alcoholism, and advanced age. It can be precipitated by iodinated contrast agents. Metformin inhibits both hepatic lactate uptake and conversion of lactate to glucose. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but severe toxicity is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and myalgia. Acute pancreatitis has been reported in one case report. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe lactic acidosis, confusion, mental status depression, hypothermia, hypotension, and renal failure may develop.  Rarely, ventricular dysrhythmias, respiratory insufficiency, and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal pain, anorexia, headache, and rash. SERIOUS EFFECTS: Lactic acidosis (generally only in patients with renal insufficiency or hepatic disease) and megaloblastic anemia. Hypotension, ventricular extrasystoles, and myocardial infarction have been reported with therapeutic doses. DRUG INTERACTION: Use of radiocontrast dyes in patients taking metformin increases the risk of renal failure and acidosis.  Concurrent use of metformin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of renal failure and acidosis.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930959-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>CANAGLIFLOZIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Overdose has not been reported. Obtain baseline electrolytes (including magnesium, phosphate and potassium concentrations) following a significant exposure. HYPOTENSION: Monitor vital signs. Assess fluid status; osmotic diuresis and intravascular depletion may develop. Replace fluids (oral or IV fluids) as indicated. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Ingestion of canagliflozin alone is not expected to cause severe hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or insulin secretogogues severe hypoglycemia may develop. In patients with canagliflozin overdose who are also taking insulin or insulin secretogogues, obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. DIET: If the patient is awake and alert, offer carbohydrates. If hypoglycemia persists or becomes severe, treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia. NOT RECOMMENDED: Prophylactic dextrose administration is not recommended in patients who do not become hypoglycemic, as it may make it difficult to distinguish patients who become hypoglycemic and require prolonged hospitalization from those who remain asymptomatic and may be discharged sooner. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPOTENSION: Treat moderate to severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine or norepinephrine as necessary. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Ingestion of canagliflozin alone is not expected to cause severe hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or insulin secretogogues severe hypoglycemia may develop. In patients with canagliflozin overdose who are also taking insulin or insulin secretogogues, obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. Treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS\/SEIZURES: Patients with persistent or recurring hypoglycemia may develop CNS depression and seizures. Correct hypoglycemia. If seizures persist after glucose correction, treat with benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol. Administer IV fluids for correction of volume loss and electrolyte abnormalities.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be used if the patient presents early and is able to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Generally, airway management is not necessary as CNS depression from these agents should resolve with dextrose administration. Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with excessive drowsiness and the inability to protect their own airway that do not respond to IV dextrose.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypoglycemia: DEXTROSE: Give dextrose if symptomatic or BS less than 60 mg\/dL. DOSE: ADULT: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg of D50W (50% dextrose) IV push; ADOLESCENT: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (1 to 2 mL\/kg) of 50% dextrose IV push; INFANT and CHILD: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (2 to 4 mL\/kg) of 25% dextrose IV push. Follow with an infusion of 10% dextrose; titrate to a BS of 100 mg\/dL. DIET: When the patient is awake and alert, supplement IV glucose with carbohydrate intake.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are usually manifestations of severe hypoglycemia; correct with IV dextrose. If seizures persist despite euglycemia, anticonvulsants (ie. benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol) are indicated.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Administer IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Ingestion of canagliflozin alone is not expected to cause severe hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or insulin secretogogues severe hypoglycemia may develop. In patients with canagliflozin overdose who are also taking insulin or insulin secretogogues, obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. Monitor vital signs. Monitor fluid status and electrolyte balance including potassium, magnesium and phosphate in symptomatic patients. Plasma levels are not clinically useful for managing overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is likely not to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding (99%) and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: All children with ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Adults with a deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Diabetic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of an extra dose who are asymptomatic can be monitored at home. Asymptomatic non-diabetic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of one or two pills can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: There is no information on the onset or duration of hypoglycemia after overdose of these patients; however, due to the prolonged half-life of canagliflozin patients may need to be monitored for a minimum of 10 to 12 hours if they are also taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop hypoglycemia should be admitted for a minimum of 24 hours for frequent blood glucose monitoring. They should only be discharged when free of symptoms and are able to maintain euglycemia without supplemental dextrose for 8 hours. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or a poison center for assistance with medical management in patients with severe overdose or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>METFORMIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive care is the mainstay of treatment in patients who present with mild to moderate biguanide toxicity. Hypoglycemia from coingestion of other hypoglycemic agents should be managed with dextrose administration. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Early intubation and ventilation assistance should be performed if the patient presents with respiratory or mental status depression. Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if patient presents with circulatory collapse. If the patient develops severe anion gap metabolic acidosis or severe lactic acidosis (pH 7.1 or less), intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, then titrate to correct pH to above 7.2) should be given and emergent hemodialysis should be arranged (especially if renal insufficiency exists).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be considered after large ingestions, if the patient has an appropriate level of consciousness, patent airway, and the patient can drink the charcoal.

Dose - Adult 50 mL of 50% dextrose IV push; Child 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (2-4 mL\/kg) of 25% dextrose IV push. Follow with an infusion of 10% dextrose; titrate to a BS of 100 mg\/dL.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No labs are needed in case of small ingestions. Patients with larger ingestions should have serial (every 2 hours) monitoring of serum electrolytes and lactate. Monitor arterial blood gases in patients with metabolic acidosis. Monitor renal function and liver enzymes.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis  is effective in improving acid-base status and may improve clinical outcome in patients with severe lactic acidosis, especially in patients with renal insufficiency, however, it does not remove significant amounts of metformin because of its large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children with acute inadvertent ingestions of 1700 mg or less may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Four to 6 hours of observation period is recommended after immediate-release metformin overdose. Peak concentrations of delayed-release formulations are expected to be delayed after overdose. After an overdose, patients should be observed for the development of toxic effects for 2 to 6 hours longer than the Tmax (Tmax: Glucophage XR 7 hours, Glumetza extended-release: 7 to 8 hours. Fortamet extended-release: 6 hours). Patients who remain asymptomatic during this period with no evidence of metabolic acidosis or hypoglycemia can be discharged home. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity, or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930959-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>CANAGLIFLOZIN <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established. There have been no reports of overdose with canagliflozin. Nondiabetic volunteers tolerated doses of 100 mg and 300 mg during pharmacokinetic testing.

ADULT: In adults, ingestions of 5 g or less are generally well tolerated. Severe toxicity developed after ingestions of 25 or more of metformin. A woman ingested 75 to 100 grams of metformin and developed severe lactic acidosis. Following aggressive supportive care, her condition improved gradually. An elderly adult survived an intentional ingestion of 63 grams of metformin and developed no permanent sequelae. PEDIATRIC: Ingestions of up to 1700 mg of metformin were well tolerated in healthy children. A 15-year-old girl developed lactic acidosis and acute renal failure after ingesting 38.25 g (0.55 g\/kg body weight) of metformin. She recovered completely following supportive care. A 15-year-old girl developed lactic acidosis, hypotension, and recurrent and severe hypoglycemia, requiring boluses of 50% dextrose after ingesting 75 g of metformin and 3 g of quetiapine in a suicide attempt. She recovered following supportive care. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Immediate-release form: 1000 to 2550 mg orally daily in 2 to 3 divided doses; maximum: 2550 mg\/day.
