Avoid use of GBCAs unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI.

Screen all patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (eg, age greater than 60 years, hypertension, or diabetes), perform lab testing to estimate the GFR.

Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton\"s field, thus disturbing the proton\"s local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoteridol shortens the T1 relaxation time in tissues where it accumulates. Gadoteridol does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in central nervous system (CNS) lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoteridol in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts.  <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"246250-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"3":{"id":"246250-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Renal: 94% <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"246250-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 1.57  plus or minus  0.08 h <br\/>"}}},"10":{"id":"246250-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>improved lesion visualization during MRI examination is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>acute kidney injury screening in all patients; estimated GFR through laboratory testing in patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function<\/li><li>signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions in patients with a history of allergy, drug reactions, or hypersensitivity-like disorders; during the procedure and for several hours following administration<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"246250-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Prohance<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 279.3 MG\/ML<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"246250-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Drug may cause headache, dizziness, increased heart rate, and flushing.<\/li><li>Drug may cause dyspnea, vomiting, rash, pruritus, and injections site reactions.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (burning, itching, swelling, scaling, hardening and tightening of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; muscle weakness; pain in hips or ribs; and joint stiffness).<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
