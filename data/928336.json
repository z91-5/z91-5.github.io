PHARMACOLOGY: Pentetate zinc trisodium (Zn-DTPA) increases the rates of radiocontaminant elimination by forming stable chelates with metal ions. The zinc ion is exchanged for ions with higher binding capacity. The radioactive chelates are then excreted into the urine by glomerular filtration. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: There is no current information regarding acute overdose in humans. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Headache, lightheadedness, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pelvic pain, and trace element deficiency have been reported following therapeutic use of pentetate zinc trisodium (Zn-DTPA). <br\/>"},{"id":"928336-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b> PENTETATE ZINC TRISODIUM <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any electrolyte abnormalities, as necessary.  NOTE: A patient exposed to radiation requires concomitant monitoring and treatment for radiation toxicity; see RADIATION management, as appropriate.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral or inhalational routes.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor CBC with differential, renal function, and serum electrolytes (including calcium, magnesium). Measure the radioactivity in blood, urine, and fecal samples weekly to monitor the radioactive contaminant elimination rate. A baseline estimate of the total body burden of transuranium element should be obtained by whole-body counting and bioassay when possible.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure:  There is no information regarding the effectiveness of hemodialysis or hemoperfusion for the removal of pentetate zinc trisodium from plasma.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Home exposure is unlikely to occur. A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients with underlying cardiac abnormalities may require ECG monitoring in addition to electrolyte\/fluid analysis. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant gastrointestinal symptoms and persistent electrolyte imbalances likely need to be admitted for further treatment and monitoring. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or for whom diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928336-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b> PENTETATE ZINC TRISODIUM <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A minimum toxic dose has not been established.
