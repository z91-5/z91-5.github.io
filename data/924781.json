PHARMACOLOGY: Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody (chimeric IgG1 kappa) with specific activity for human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The specific activity of infliximab is high-affinity binding to TNF-alpha receptors and neutralizing TNF-alpha activity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Data are limited. Clinical effects are anticipated to be an extension of the adverse effects seen with therapeutic use. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (greater than 10%): Infections (eg, upper respiratory sinusitis, and pharyngitis), infusion-related reactions, headache, and abdominal pain. OTHER EFFECTS: Nausea, dyspepsia, fatigue, hypertension, chest pain, hypotension, dyspnea, worsening congestive heart failure, prolonged QT interval, rash, flushing, pruritus, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urinary tract infection, optic neuritis, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, severe hepatic reactions (eg, acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis), hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, bone fracture, backache, drug-induced lupus erythematosus, polyneuropathy, Pneumocystis, fever, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections (usually present with disseminated infection compared to localized disease), histoplasmosis, mycosis, seizures (rare), and CNS demyelinating disease (rare). <br\/>"},{"id":"924781-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>INFLIXIMAB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives. Monitor for signs and symptoms of severe infection (eg, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis). Myelosuppression has been reported. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Therapeutic doses of infliximab may cause prolongation of the QT interval. In patients with QT prolongation, monitor serum electrolytes including potassium, calcium and magnesium in patients with significant overdose; correct any abnormalities.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable.
