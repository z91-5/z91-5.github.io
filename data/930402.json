In a clinical trial of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, at least one elevation in ALT greater than or equal to 3 times the ULN occurred in 12% of patients treated with mipomersen sodium vs 0% with placebo. Mipomersen sodium increases hepatic fat, with or without increases in transaminases. In a clinical trial of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat when measured by MRI was 10% after 26 weeks of treatment vs 0% at baseline. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for advanced liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels prior to initiating therapy, and then monitor ALT and AST levels regularly as recommended. Withhold the dose if ALT or AST levels are greater than or equal to 3 times the ULN during therapy and discontinue treatment for clinically significant liver toxicity. Due to the risk of hepatotoxicity, mipomersen sodium is only available through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) restricted program called the Kynamro(R) REMS.<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"930402-s-3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"930402-s-3-9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"<ul><li>Active liver disease, including unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity to any product component<\/li><li>Moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930402-s-3-10","title":"Precautions","mono":"<ul><li>Black Box Warning:<\/li><li>-- Elevations in transaminases have been reported; monitoring recommended; interrupt therapy for confirmed transaminase elevations and discontinue for elevated transaminases together with clinical symptoms of liver toxicity<\/li><li>-- Increases in hepatic fat, with or without increases in transaminases, have been reported and may increase risk for advanced liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis<\/li><li>Dermatologic:<\/li><li>-- Injection site reactions have been reported, including erythema, pain, tenderness, pruritus, and local swelling<\/li><li>Immunologic:<\/li><li>-- Flu-like symptoms have been reported, including influenza-like illness, pyrexia, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise, or fatigue<\/li><li>Renal:<\/li><li>-- Patients with severe renal impairment, clinically significant proteinuria, or on renal dialysis; not recommended<\/li><li>Concomitant Use:<\/li><li>-- Alcohol may increase levels of hepatic fat and induce or exacerbate liver injury; consumption of no more than one alcoholic drink per day is recommended<\/li><li>-- Concomitant use with other LDL-lowering agents not recommended<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930402-s-3-11","title":"Pregnancy Category","mono":"Mipomersen: B (FDA)<br\/>"},{"id":"930402-s-3-12","title":"Breast Feeding","mono":"Mipomersen: Micromedex: Infant risk cannot be ruled out.<br\/>"}]},"5":{"id":"930402-s-5","title":"Adverse Effects","mono":"<b>Common<\/b><ul><li><b>Cardiovascular:<\/b>Hypertension (7%), Peripheral edema (5%)<\/li><li><b>Dermatologic:<\/b>Abnormal color (17%), Erythema (59%), Hematoma (32%), Injection site edema (18%), Injection site pain (56%), Injection site reaction (84%), Injection site reaction, Recall (8%), Pruritus (29%)<\/li><li><b>Gastrointestinal:<\/b>Nausea (14%)<\/li><li><b>Hepatic:<\/b>ALT\/SGPT level raised (all increases, 10%; 3 or more times ULN, 12% to 16.5%; 5 or more times ULN, 3% to 9%), AST\/SGOT level raised (all increases, 6%; 3 or more times the ULN, 7%; 5 or more times ULN, 3%), Liver function tests abnormal (5%)<\/li><li><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Antibody development (38% to 72%)<\/li><li><b>Musculoskeletal:<\/b>Pain in limb (7%)<\/li><li><b>Neurologic:<\/b>Headache (12%)<\/li><li><b>Renal:<\/b>Proteinuria, 1+ or greater (9%)<\/li><li><b>Other:<\/b>Fatigue (15%), Fever (8%), Influenza-like illness (13% to 66%), Shivering (6%)<\/li><\/ul><b>Serious<\/b><ul><li><b>Hepatic:<\/b>Steatosis of liver (7% to 62%)<\/li><li><b>Renal:<\/b>Anti-glomerular basement membrane tubulointerstitial nephritis<\/li><li><b>Other:<\/b>Angioedema, Cancer (4%)<\/li><\/ul>"},"6":{"id":"930402-s-6","title":"Drug Name Info","sub":{"0":{"id":"930402-s-6-17","title":"US Trade Names","mono":"Kynamro<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"930402-s-6-19","title":"Class","mono":"<ul><li>Antihyperlipidemic<\/li><li>Antisense Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotide<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"930402-s-6-20","title":"Regulatory Status","mono":"RX<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"930402-s-6-21","title":"Generic Availability","mono":"No<br\/>"}}},"7":{"id":"930402-s-7","title":"Mechanism Of Action","mono":"Mipomersen sodium is an oligonucleotide inhibitor of apo B-100 synthesis, inhibiting synthesis of apo B by sequence-specific binding to its messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) through enzyme-mediated pathways or disruption of mRNA function through binding alone.

PHARMACOLOGY: Mipomersen sodium is an oligonucleotide inhibitor of apo B-100 synthesis. Apo B is the principal apolipoprotein of LDL and VLDL. Inhibition of translation of the apo B-100 protein results in decreased LDL and VLDL levels. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. It is anticipated that overdose effects may be an extension of events reported with therapeutic use. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Injection site reactions, flu-like symptoms, nausea, headache, and elevations of liver enzymes. OTHER EFFECTS: Headache, fatigue, angina, peripheral edema, hypertension, vomiting, abdominal pain, proteinuria, hypersensitivity reaction, pain in extremity, fever, and chills. <br\/>"},{"id":"930402-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MIPOMERSEN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
