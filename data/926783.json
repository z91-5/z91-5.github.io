Produced in response to inflammatory stimuli, IL-1 mediates various inflammatory and immunological responses, and has activity involving cartilage degradation and stimulation of bone resorption. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, the levels of endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist in synovium and synovial fluid are insufficient to compete with the elevated amount of locally produced IL-1. Patients with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease may have spontaneous gene mutations that lead to IL-1 beta secretion and increased systemic inflammation.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"926783-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"926783-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Tmax, SubQ: 3 to 7 hours<\/li><li>Bioavailability, SubQ: 95%<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"926783-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Bile: minimal<\/li><li>Renal, rheumatoid arthritis: 80%, unchanged<\/li><li>Dialyzable: No (hemodialysis), 2.5%; No (peritoneal), 2.5%<\/li><li>Total body clearance: increases with increasing CrCl and body weight<\/li><li>Total body clearance, renal impairment: decreased by 16% to 75%<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"926783-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"4 to 6 hours <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"926783-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Subcutaneous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>do not shake<\/li><li>administer the dose for rheumatoid arthritis at approximately the same time every day<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"926783-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, and rheumatoid factor levels<\/li><li>symptomatic improvement is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>neutrophil count; prior to initiating therapy, monthly for the first 3 months of therapy, the quarterly for up to one year<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"926783-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Kineret<\/b><br\/>Subcutaneous Solution: 100 MG\/0.67 ML<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"926783-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Instruct patient to report symptoms of an infection.<\/li><li>Advise patient to avoid live virus vaccines during therapy due to drug-induced immunosuppression.<\/li><li>Side effects may include injection site reactions, rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flu-like symptoms, or arthralgia.<\/li><li>Advise patient about proper injection technique and placement.<\/li><li>Counsel patient to leave syringe at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to injection.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
