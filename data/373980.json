PHARMACOLOGY: These drugs are fungistatic and may be fungicidal, depending on concentration. Imidazoles inhibit biosynthesis of ergosterol or other sterols, damaging the fungal cell membrane and altering its permeability.  As a result, loss of essential intracellular elements may occur. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose experience is limited with these agents.  Due to minimal oral absorption and limited systemic toxicity, severe toxic effects following oral overdose is not anticipated. Ingestion of even large quantities should produce only minor GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  ADVERSE EFFECTS: Allergic contact dermatitis to these agents is rare but has been reported.  Following dermal applications, pruritus, erythema, stinging, urticaria and localized edema have been reported. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequent side effects following oral administration of clotrimazole. Elevated liver enzymes have rarely been reported following the use of clotrimazole troches and sertaconazole 2% topical cream. Drowsiness and disorientation have been reported following oral clotrimazole therapy. Headache may infrequently occur following therapeutic use of these agents.<br\/><\/li><li><b>MICONAZOLE <\/b><br\/>USES: Buccal miconazole tablet is indicated in patients for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Intravaginal miconazole is recommended as an agent of choice for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Miconazole 0.25%, zinc oxide 15%, and white petrolatum combination ointment is indicated for the treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis. PHARMACOLOGY: Miconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent that inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme CYP450 14-alpha-demethylase. Additionally, miconazole affects triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis and increases the amount of reactive oxygen species within the cell. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose of buccal or topical miconazole. INTRAVENOUS: Seizures have been reported following IV miconazole overdose. Cardiac and respiratory arrest have been observed after high-dose or rapid IV use.  IV formulation is not available in the US. ADVERSE EFFECTS: In general, miconazole is not highly toxic.  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dysgeusia, pruritus, contact dermatitis, and anaphylactic reactions have been reported following therapeutic use of miconazole. Buccal tablets have also caused oral discomfort, oral burning, oral pain, gingival pain, swelling, or pruritus, tongue ulceration, mouth ulceration, glossodynia, dry mouth, toothache, loss of taste, and altered taste. INTRAVENOUS: Intravenous miconazole has caused tremors, hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, hyponatremia, seizures, transient tachycardia and dysrhythmias, thrombophlebitis, thrombocytosis, microcytic normochromic anemia, phlebitis, and anemia. Intravenous formulation is no longer available in the United States.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"373980-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>IMIDAZOLE ANTIFUNGALS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
