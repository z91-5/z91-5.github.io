In the endometrium, ospemifene has estrogen agonistic effects. There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Estrogen-alone therapy has an increased risk of stroke and DVT. Ospemifene 60 mg\/day had cerebral thromboembolic and hemorrhagic stroke incidences of 0.72 and 1.45 per 1000 women, respectively, vs 1.04 and 0 per 1000 women in placebo.
