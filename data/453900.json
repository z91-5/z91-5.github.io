PHARMACOLOGY: Pentostatin is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). Inhibition of ADA leads to cytotoxicity which is believed to be due to elevated intracellular levels of deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate (dATP) that block DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase. Additionally, pentostatin can inhibit RNA synthesis and cause DNA damage. The exact mechanism for the antitumor effect in patients with hairy cell leukemia is unknown. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose information is limited. Exceeding the recommended dose has been associated with a more rapid onset of typical adverse effects. High doses of pentostatin (20 to 50 mg\/m(2) in divided doses over 5 days) were associated with deaths due to severe renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and CNS toxicity. ADVERSE EFFECTS: GREATER THAN 10%: Pruritus, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, stomatitis, genitourinary disorder, leukopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, myalgia, headache, asthenia, fatigue, cough, upper respiratory infection, rhinitis, lung disorder, dyspnea, fever, and chills. UP TO 10%: Chest pain, hypotension, peripheral edema, skin disorder, urticaria, dry skin, gingivitis, dyspepsia, increased serum creatinine, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, arthralgia, paresthesia, insomnia, dizziness, somnolence, confusion, anxiety, nervousness, depression, asthma, pharyngitis, and unspecified infection. OTHER EFFECTS: Acute allergic reaction, nephropathy, renal failure, renal insufficiency, seizures, elevated liver enzymes, and hemolytic anemia. Although the drug association of some adverse events, such as infections or hematological suppression, is uncertain as they may be associated with the disease itself, other events, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, and elevated liver enzymes may be attributed to the drug. <br\/>"},{"id":"453900-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PENTOSTATIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Myelosuppression has been reported. Monitor serial CBCs with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg, filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Immediately drain at least 20 ml CSF; drainage of up to 70 ml has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 ml aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free saline).  Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 mL\/hr). Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory symptoms, significant CNS depression, or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors if patients develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBCs with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. In patients with a pentostatin overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Hematologic effects, such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may occur following pentostatin exposure.  Monitor serial CBCs with differential,  including platelets, for several weeks following an overdose. In patients with neutropenia, monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with prolonged vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor renal function and hepatic enzymes in patients with significant exposure. Monitor vital signs frequently. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no information regarding the effectiveness of hemodialysis or hemoperfusion for the removal of pentostatin from plasma. Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours) and daily monitoring of CBCs with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"453900-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PENTOSTATIN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A minimum toxic dose has not been established.
