As a medication, it functions as an antimitotic and anti-inflammatory agent used to treat gout, familial Mediterranean fever, secondary amyloidosis, and scleroderma. Exposure occurs by oral and IV routes. PHARMACOLOGY: Colchicine binds to tubulin, a main component of microtubules, and causes cytoskeletal changes. Its anti-inflammatory properties are due to inhibiting the migration of leukocytes and proinflammatory cytokines into affected tissues. Finally, it inhibits uric acid crystal deposition in gout. TOXICOLOGY: Colchicine inhibits mitosis of dividing cells and functions as a microtubule or spindle poison. In overdose, it preferentially affects rapidly dividing cells. In high concentrations it is a general cellular poison. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is very uncommon but causes significant morbidity and mortality. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Mild overdose causes mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. SEVERE POISONING: Severe overdose causes clinical findings in 3 phases but may be delayed initially a few hours: PHASE I (0 TO 24 HOURS) - GASTROINTESTINAL: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (bloody), abdominal pain, dehydration, leukocytosis, volume depletion, hypotension. PHASE II (1 TO 7 DAYS) - MULTIORGAN SYSTEM FAILURE: Possible risk of sudden cardiac death, dysrhythmias; confusion, coma, seizures; pancytopenia, renal failure, hepatic failure, sepsis, acute lung injury, electrolyte imbalances, rhabdomyolysis.  Patients with severe overdose may die during this phase. PHASE III (OVER 7 DAYS) - RECOVERY OR DEATH: Alopecia; myopathy, neuropathy, myoneuropathy, or rebound leukocytosis; death usually is caused by respiratory failure, intractable shock, dysrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR PROGNOSIS POST-INGESTION: A large dose; increased INR; WBC greater than 18K within 24 hours of ingestion; cardiogenic shock within 72 hours. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: At therapeutic doses, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) are commonly seen. LESS COMMON: Alopecia and anorexia may occur less frequently. RARE: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, dysrhythmias, bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, myopathy, peripheral neuritis, and rash may rarely be observed. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Substances that inhibit CYP 3A4 (eg; atazanavir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, nefazodone, and grapefruit juice) and substances that inhibit P-glycoprotein (eg; cyclosporine, ranolazine) increase colchicine plasma concentrations, and cause toxicity at lower doses.<br\/>"},{"id":"132650-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>COLCHICINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is supportive with attention to the airway, breathing, and circulation. For mild to moderate overdose, consider GI decontamination and treat for shock. Administer IV fluids, antiemetics, and pressors if needed. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is supportive in the ICU. Multiorgan system failure may occur 1 to 7 days post-ingestion. Treat with IV fluids, vasopressors, cardiac monitoring, intubation, antibiotics for sepsis, dialysis for acute renal failure as needed. Pancytopenia has been reported. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (e.g., filgrastim, sargramostim). If severe coagulopathy with bleeding develops transfuse with red blood cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma as indicated. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if vomiting is controlled. HOSPITAL: Gastric lavage may be useful if performed within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion and if vomiting is controlled. Administer activated charcoal (AC) and consider multidose AC due to enterohepatic recirculation.<\/li><li>Airway management: Practice usual airway management.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no current antidote, however, colchicine-specific antibodies were used in one overdose case. They are not available in the US.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, CBC, CPK, liver enzymes, INR, and urinalysis. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients. Specific drug levels are not clinically useful or widely available.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis does not remove colchicine because of its large volume of distribution and high protein binding, but may be useful when acute renal failure develops.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  Patients with accidental ingestions of therapeutic doses can be observed at home. If there is any potential for the ingestion of a toxic dose, the patient should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any symptomatic patient or one with an intentional ingestion should be sent to the hospital and observed. If no gastrointestinal symptoms develop within 8 to 12 hours of ingestion, the patient may be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any symptomatic patient with an intentional ingestion or suspected or known significant overdose should be admitted to the ICU. CONSULT CRITERIA: Nephrology should be consulted if acute renal failure develops.
