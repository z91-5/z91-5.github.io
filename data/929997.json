This class includes etravirine, delavirdine mesylate, efavirenz, nevirapine, and rilpivirine. PHARMACOLOGY: NNRTIs bind adjacent to the active site of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, causing conformational change and thus inactivation of the enzyme. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicological effects are generally extensions of adverse effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon, and severe sequelae from acute overdose is rare. Adverse effects and drug interactions, however, are common. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The majority of patients will have minimal or no symptoms following overdose. Mild transaminitis may occur in the setting of overdose. Psychiatric disturbances characterized by mania, agitation, and sometimes somnolence have been observed in overdose. Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting have been reported. Transient mild neutropenia and hyperlactemia developed in an infant after intravenous overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Headache, dizziness, transaminitis, rash, nausea, vomiting,  diarrhea, paresthesias, psychiatric disturbances, and hyperlipidemia are the most commonly reported adverse effects. Other adverse effects specific to each drug include: DELAVIRDINE: rash (36%), hepatitis (rare), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare), neutropenia (rare). EFAVIRENZ: headache, dizziness, impaired concentration, abnormal dreams, or other CNS\/psychiatric disturbances (52%), rash (27%), transaminitis, fever, hyperlipidemia. ETRAVIRINE: rash, peripheral neuropathy, toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare), hepatitis (rare). NEVIRAPINE: rash (7%), pruritus, hepatitis (1%), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (0.3%), fever. Hypersensitivity syndrome (HHS) has been described approximately 4 weeks following the therapeutic use of nevirapine.  Generalized maculopapular rash, eosinophilia, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly developed. DRUG INTERACTIONS: DELAVIRDINE: A CYP3A4 substrate and inhibitor and a CYP2C9 inhibitor; carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin, and phenytoin may decrease delavirdine concentrations; may increase plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 substrates. EFAVIRENZ: A CYP3A4 substrate and inducer, and a CYP2B6 substrate; may decrease phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and methadone concentrations; may cause false positive tetrahydrocannabinol tests. ETRAVIRINE: A CYP3A4 substrate and inducer, a CYP2C9 substrate and inhibitor, and a CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor; may increase the INR when administered with warfarin; may decrease etravirine concentrations when administered with phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital; may increase digoxin concentrations. NEVIRAPINE: A CYP3A4 substrate and inducer, and a CYP2B6 substrate; may cause methadone withdrawal; may decrease plasma concentrations of oral contraceptives; may decrease ketoconazole concentrations; administration with rifampin may decrease nevirapine concentrations.<br\/><\/li><li><b>AIDS ANTIVIRAL NUCLEOSIDES <\/b><br\/>USES: The nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are primarily used in the treatment of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. This class includes: emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, abacavir, and tenofovir; zidovudine and didanosine are in this class but are covered in separate managements, and zalcitabine is no longer manufactured. These agents are also used in the treatment of hepatitis B infection and human T-lymphocyte virus (HTLV) 1 and 2. PHARMACOLOGY: The NRTIs terminate HIV RNA to DNA transcription by acting as substrates for the HIV reverse transcriptase and terminating DNA elongation. These agents prevent cell infection, but have no effect on already infected cells. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicological effects are generally extensions of adverse effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon and severe sequelae from acute overdose are rare. Adverse effects and drug interactions, however, are common. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: There are limited data regarding overdose of NRTIs. However, overdose appears to be largely well tolerated with very few reports of severe clinical effects despite over 2 decades of drug availability. Nausea or vomiting, neurologic symptoms (ie, ataxia, lethargy, nystagmus, peripheral neuropathy), signs of bone marrow toxicity (ie, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), or an increase in liver enzymes have all been reported in NRTI overdose or chronic toxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity has been reported after therapeutic use but not after acute overdose, and may be manifested by pancreatitis, hepatic steatosis, acute renal failure (ie, tenofovir), neuropsychiatric abnormalities, or acidosis. Chronic therapeutic administration may lead to mitochondrial toxicity leading to lactic acidosis, with or without hepatic microsteatosis. Pancreatitis, neuropathy, and myopathy often accompany the syndrome. Severe neuropsychiatric effects (ie, seizures, mania) have been reported. Lactic acidosis has been reported in patients receiving both single and dual nucleoside analogue (NRTI) regimens for HIV infection. This is thought to cause multiorgan failure and most commonly occurs in persons on prolonged (more than 6 months) therapy. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common adverse effects from all NRTIs are nausea, vomiting, headache, and malaise. Peripheral neuropathy and elevated transaminases have been reported with most NRTIs. Rash and hypersensitivity reactions are common and are usually self-limited when therapy is continued. Other adverse effects specific to each drug include: ABACAVIR: Hypersensitivity, nausea, vomiting, headache, and a possible increased risk of coronary artery disease. EMTRICITABINE: Rash, diarrhea, hypercholesterolemia, transaminitis, and mild rhabdomyolysis are common. Hepatic failure\/steatosis, neutropenia, and lactic acidosis are rare. LAMIVUDINE: Headache and nausea are common. Pancreatitis is rare. STAVUDINE: Peripheral neuropathy in greater than 60% of patients receiving over 4 mg\/kg daily. Lactic acidosis and transaminitis are common and do not require therapy or discontinuation unless severe. Dyslipidemia and insulin resistance have been associated with chronic stavudine and zidovudine. TENOFOVIR: Rash, headache, transaminitis, nausea, and vomiting are common. Hepatic failure\/steatosis, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, and lactic acidosis are rare. ZALCITABINE: Peripheral neuropathy, stomatitis, pancreatitis, transaminitis, and rash.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929997-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>AIDS ANTIVIRAL NON-NUCLEOSIDES<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Supportive care remains the mainstay of care.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome should be treated with supportive care and consideration of corticosteroid and IV immunoglobulin therapy.

Peripheral neuropathies are generally reversible with drug withdrawal and can be treated with pain management as needed. Asymptomatic elevation of lactic acid without systemic acidemia does not require discontinuation of the medication. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care is the mainstay of care. Aggressive fluid resuscitation should be initiated for severe lactic acidosis. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor may be considered for patients with agranulocytosis complicated by infection.
