Also used topically to treat or prevent skin infections and as eye drops or ointment for bacterial conjunctivitis. PHARMACOLOGY: Aminoglycosides function by binding the aminoacyl site of 16S ribosomal RNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit. This binding results in the misreading of genetic code, inhibition of translocation, and bacterial cell death. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Given that aminoglycosides (with the exception of neomycin) are only available in parenteral, topical, and ophthalmic forms, overdoses are almost entirely the result of dosing errors. Overdoses are rarely life-threatening and typically require minimal intervention. Ingestions of ophthalmic or topical preparations do not cause toxicity related to the aminoglycoside. Although neomycin is available orally, oral absorption is low and acute toxicity from overdosage is unlikely. OVERDOSE: Toxicity is more closely associated with trough levels of the drug than peak levels. Renal damage (acute tubular necrosis; usually reversible), ototoxicity (irreversible), and vestibular toxicity (irreversible) are most common. Renal injury may often go unnoticed until significant injury has occurred, given the delay between when renal injury occurs and when the elevation in creatinine is evident. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Retinopathy and visual loss with intraocular administration. Apnea and neuromuscular blockade may occur when aminoglycosides are given rapidly IV with neuromuscular blocking agents, due to aminoglycosides' inhibition of acetylcholine release from presynaptic nerve terminals; patients with abnormal neuromuscular junction function (eg, myasthenia gravis, botulism) can develop respiratory failure or weakness after use of aminoglycosides alone. Rash and hypersensitivity reactions can occur.<br\/><\/li><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/>USES: Antiinflammatory agents used to treat a variety of clinical conditions, including adrenal insufficiency, asthma, various allergy disorders, and autoimmune disorders (eg, hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus). Corticosteroids are available in oral, parenteral, inhalational, and topical formulations. PHARMACOLOGY: Multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions. Anti-inflammatory effects result from decreased formation, release and activity of the mediators of inflammation (eg, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) which reduced the initial manifestations of the inflammatory process. The immunosuppressive properties decrease the response to delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, type III and type IV).  The antiproliferative effects reduce hyperplastic tissue characteristic of psoriasis. TOXICOLOGY: Corticosteroids decrease calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion, and inhibit osteoblast formation, leading to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute toxicity following overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Acute ingestion is rarely a clinical problem. Acute adrenal insufficiency rarely reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial fibrillation)(methylPREDNISolone), seizures (methylPREDNISolone), anaphylaxis. CHRONIC EXPOSURE:  Cushingoid appearance, muscle wasting and weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia, subcapsulary cataracts and glaucoma, osteoporosis, psychosis. ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL:  Dysphoria, irritability, emotional liability, depression, fatigue,  anxiety, depersonalization, myalgia, and arthralgia.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jsf0s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>AMINOGLYCOSIDES<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
