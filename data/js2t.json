Within aerobic microorganisms, azelaic acid reversibly inhibits a variety of oxidoreductive enzymes including tyrosinase, mitochondrial enzymes of the respiratory chain, thioredoxin reductase, 5-alpha-reductase, and DNA polymerases.   In anaerobic microorganisms, glycolysis is disrupted. <\/li><li>Also, azelaic acid improves acne vulgaris by decreasing microcomedo formation and normalizing the keratin process. Azelaic acid may be effective against both inflamed and noninflamed lesions . Specifically, azelaic acid reduces the thickness of the stratum corneum, shrinks keratohyalin granules by reducing the amount and distribution of filaggrin (a component of keratohyalin) in epidermal layers, and lowers the number of keratohyalin granules. <\/li><li>Hypopigmentation agent, Azelaic acid&quot;s antityrosinase and antimitochondrial enzymatic activities may interrupt the hyperactivity of normal melanocytes and their resulting growth in melasma, a localized macular hyperpigmentation of facial or nuchal skin . Use of azelaic acid to treat hyperpigmentation disorders due to hyperactivity of abnormal melanocytes has not been consistently successful . The hypopigmentation action of azelaic acid may result, to a lesser extent, from its ability to scavenge free radicals that can cause hyperactivity of melanocytes. Free radicals are a metabolic product of peroxidation of cell membrane lipids, produced when cells are irradiated with ultraviolet light, including sunlight.   There is no depigmenting effect on normal melanocytes. <\/li><li>Azelaic acid is being studied for potential antimycotic   and antiviral properties. <\/li><li>In time- and dose-dependent  in vitro  studies, azelaic acid has been shown to selectively penetrate rapidly growing human and murine tumor cells that are undifferentiated and possess chromosomal abnormalities while not affecting normal cells.   The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects are attributed to the antityrosinase and antimitochondrial   activity of azelaic acid. Further  in vivo studies are needed to fully characterize the clinical course of azelaic acid within these cell lines. <\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"js2ts8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"js2ts8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Topical: 3 to 10% <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"js2ts8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Topical: Renal: unchanged <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"js2ts9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Topical<\/b><br\/><ul><li>apply a thin film and massage thoroughly in morning and evening on clean skin<\/li><li>do not use occlusive dressings<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"js2ts10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>improved acne<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of hypopigmentation<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"js2ts11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Azelex<\/b><br\/>Topical Cream: 20 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Finacea<\/b><br\/>Topical Gel\/Jelly: 15 %<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"js2ts12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"js2ts12b31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>AZELAIC ACID<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: No human data.
