It is also indicated, as palliative therapy, for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the breast or endometrium.  PHARMACOLOGY: Megestrol acetate, a synthetic derivative of progesterone, is suggested to reduce estrogen secretion by inhibiting the production of pituitary gonadotropin in endometrial carcinoma. As an antineoplastic, it is suggested that megestrol acetate exerts direct cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells by either interfering with availability, stability and turnover of estrogen and the interaction with genes at the estrogen receptor complex or at the progestin receptor complex by interacting directly to turn of the specific estrogen-responsive genes. The exact mechanism of action for its clinical use in endometrial cancer and as appetite-enhancing agent in cachexia remains unknown. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: In several overdose cases during postmarketing period, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, cough, unsteady gait, listlessness, and chest pain were reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Most  adverse effects are related to chronic or high-dose therapy. CHRONIC: Hyperglycemia, impotence, decreased libido, deep venous thrombosis, and tachypnea may occur with chronic therapy.  Other adverse effects that have been reported include: hypertension, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, asthenia, hot flashes, thrombophlebitis, and pulmonary embolism. HIGH-DOSE THERAPY: Cushing syndrome and cholestatic hepatitis were reported following high-dose megestrol therapy (800 to 1200 mg\/day). Mild blood pressure elevation, weight gain, increased appetite, hyperglycemia, edema, dyspnea, and congestive heart failure have been reported in patients receiving high-dose regimens (480 to 1600 mg\/day) for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. RARE: Alopecia and skin rashes have been rarely reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"366080-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MEGESTROL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: ACUTE OVERDOSE:  Single acute overdoses will seldom result in toxicity.  Supportive treatment is adequate in most situations. CHRONIC POISONING: Discontinue medication and monitor for signs of severe toxicity and treat symptomatically. Obtain a baseline CBC, hepatic enzymes, and renal function tests. Obtain a pregnancy test in women of reproductive age because of possible fetotoxic effects. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after megestrol overdose.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely, and is generally only expected with chronic use.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. HOSPITAL: Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely, and is generally only expected with chronic use.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. Consider activated charcoal only after very large ingestions or if coingestants with significant toxicity are involved. <\/li><li>Airway management: Should not be required in these cases.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine lab studies are generally not necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Obtain a pregnancy test in women of reproductive age. In self-harm ingestions, monitor serum electrolytes. Monitor vital signs, particularly blood pressure. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with cardiac symptoms or severe hypertension. CHRONIC TOXICITY: Discontinue medication and monitor for signs of toxicity and treat symptomatically.  Obtain a baseline CBC, hepatic enzymes, and renal function tests in symptomatic patients. Obtain a pregnancy test in women of reproductive age.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to the low solubility of megestrol, hemodialysis may not be an effective method of elimination.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with unintentional exposures can be watched at home with follow up with their regular physician as needed.  OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with significant adverse effects or deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admission is rarely necessary after an acute overdose. Patients with severe adverse reactions (eg, pulmonary embolism) should be admitted, and depending on the severity of their symptoms, may merit an ICU admission. Criteria for discharge include resolution or treatment of their symptoms. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.  Pregnant women who ingest megestrol should be referred for evaluation of fetotoxic effects.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"366080-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MEGESTROL <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.

In other studies, megestrol doses up to 1200 mg\/day did not result in serious unexpected side effects. In several overdose cases during postmarketing period, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, cough, unsteady gait, listlessness, and chest pain were reported.
