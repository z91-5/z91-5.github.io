Hylans are derivatives of hyaluronan, also known as sodium hyaluronate. Hyaluronan is a natural substance present in very high amounts in joints and its actions as a lubricant enables the joint to work properly. While the exact mechanism of action of hylan polymers A and B is unknown, the elasticity and viscosity of hylan G-F 20 is comparable to the elasticity and viscosity of knee synovial fluid measured in humans of 18 to 27 years old.<br\/>"},"9":{"id":"jt9ds9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intra-articular<\/b><br\/><ul><li>maintain strict aseptic technique<\/li><li>use an 18-gauge to 22-gauge needle to remove synovial fluid or effusion prior to administration; discard syringe<\/li><li>twist tip cap before pulling off to minimize product leakage<\/li><li>secure needle to hylan G-F 20 syringe using the same needle used to remove synovial fluid or effusion<\/li><li>use immediately after removal from packaging<\/li><li>use in one knee only<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jt9ds10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"reduction in pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee is indicative of efficacy<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"jt9ds11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Synvisc Hylan GF<\/b><br\/>Injection Solution: 8 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Synvisc<\/b><br\/>Injection Solution: 8 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Synvisc One<\/b><br\/>Injection Solution: 8 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"jt9ds13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Instruct patient to avoid strenuous or prolonged weight-bearing activity for 48 hours after intra-articular injection.<\/li><li>Drug may cause arthritis, arthralgia, arthropathy, injection-site pain, and joint stiffness, swelling, warmth, or effusion.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to immediately report significant leg swelling or signs\/symptoms of blood clots.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
