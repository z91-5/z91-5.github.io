for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. PHARMACOLOGY: Oxymorphone is a pure opioid agonist that is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can interact with other opioid receptors at higher doses. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1 receptor: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2 receptor: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia, and pruritus. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is life threatening, but rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting, skeletal muscle flaccidity, miosis and mydriasis. SEVERE TOXICITY: Respiratory depression, cardiovascular insufficiency, coma, and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Somnolence, constipation, dizziness, headache, nausea and\/or vomiting, pyrexia, and pruritus. LESS COMMON: Edema, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, blurred vision, syncope, and withdrawal symptoms.<br\/>"},{"id":"99nls12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OXYMORPHONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Oxymorphone overdoses are life-threatening. Activated charcoal should be considered early after a significant oral ingestion, if a patient can protect their airway and is without significant signs of toxicity. If a patient is displaying signs of moderate to severe toxicity, do NOT administer activated charcoal because of the risk of aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected oxymorphone dependence incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute oxymorphone withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed, but may be necessary in overdoses of high potency opioids, like oxymorphone. A CONTINUOUS infusion may be necessary in patients that have ingested a long-acting dosage form of oxymorphone. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1-2 hours. Oxymorphone has a longer duration of effect, so it is necessary to observe the patient at least 3-4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after acute opioid overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Oxymorphone plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of oxymorphone toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value because of the large volume of distribution for oxymorphone.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Has not been reported with oxymorphone, recommendations are based on experience with other opioids. Treat seizures (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol) and support blood pressure with fluids and pressors as needed. Naloxone infusion may be useful. Intubate and ventilate as needed. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage may accelerate recovery.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults with inadvertent overdose should be evaluated by a healthcare professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or a pediatric ingestion should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation for at least 4 hours, to ensure that peak plasma levels have been reached and there has been sufficient time for symptoms to develop. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. EXTENDED RELEASE: Following therapeutic doses of extended-release oxymorphone, peak concentrations are reached in 1 to 2 hours after ingestion. Oxymorphone is continued to be released adding to the oxymorphone load for up to 24 hours after use, requiring prolonged monitoring. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous depression should be admitted to the hospital. Patients needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as they may have taken an extended-release version of oxymorphone and may need additional doses. Patients who develop CNS or respiratory depression or who require naloxone administration after extended release formulations should be admitted. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, or delirium or those needing a naloxone infusion or intubated patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"99nls12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>OXYMORPHONE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established. With pure opioid analgesic, the maximum dose is defined by adverse events, most commonly somnolence and respiratory depression. Individual tolerance affects the toxic dose. Misuse of the extended release formulation (eg, by crushing, snorting, injecting) may result in immediate absorption of the entire dose and subsequent toxicity. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: INTRAMUSCULAR and SUBCUTANEOUS: Initially, 1 mg to 1.5 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. IV: 0.5 mg initially. ORAL: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 5 mg to 20 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. EXTENDED RELEASE: 5 mg every 12 hours for opiate naive patients.
