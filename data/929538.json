Ecallantide binds to plasma kallikrein and blocks its binding site, inhibiting the conversion of high molecular weight (HMW) kininogen to bradykinin. By directly inhibiting plasma kallikrein, it reduces the conversion of HMW kininogen to bradykinin. Because excessive bradykinin is thought to be responsible for the characteristic hereditary angioedema (HAE) symptoms (localized swelling, inflammation, and pain), ecallantide treats symptoms of acute episodic attacks of HAE by reducing excessive bradykinin generation.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"929538-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"929538-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Tmax, subQ: 2 to 3 hr <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"929538-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: 26.4 L <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"929538-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Total body clearance: 153 mL\/min <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"929538-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"2 hr <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"929538-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Subcutaneous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>3 vials are required for 1 total dose<\/li><li>withdraw liquid from vial using a large bore needle; change to suitable needle (27 gauge) prior to administration<\/li><li>administer subQ into the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm; separate sites by at least 2 inches and away from anatomical site of attack; site rotation not necessary<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"929538-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>symptomatic improvement<\/li><li>symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction, particularly within the first hour after administration<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"929538-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Kalbitor<\/b><br\/>Subcutaneous Solution: 10 MG\/ML<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"929538-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Drug may cause hypersensitivity reactions, headache, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, and nasopharyngitis.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report injection site reactions that are bothersome, such as erythema, itching, pain, irritation, urticaria, and bruising.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
