It is also used as an anticoagulant in blood transfusions, extracorporeal circulation, and dialysis procedures, and to maintain patency of vascular access devices for intermittent or infusion therapy. PHARMACOLOGY: Heparin sodium, a glycosaminoglycan, inhibits the mechanisms that induce the clotting of blood and the formation of stable fibrin clots at various sites in the normal coagulation system. When heparin sodium is combined with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor), thrombosis is blocked through inactivation of activated factor X and inhibition of prothrombin's conversion to thrombin. This also prevents fibrin formation from fibrinogen during active thrombosis. TOXICOLOGY: At low doses, heparin combines with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor). This complex then inactivates activated factor X, thereby inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. With larger doses, heparin combines with antithrombin III to inactivate factors IX, X, XI, and XII and thrombin and prevent the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (HIT): Type I HIT is a minor decrease in platelet count attributed to the direct interaction between heparin and circulating platelets. The pathophysiology of type II HIT is multifactorial, but the primary factor mediating cellular activation is the generation of anti-heparin-platelet factor 4 complex antibodies. Most patients with HIT produce IgG antibodies against complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. PF4 is found on the surface of endothelial cells and stored within the alpha granules of platelets. The antibody-PF4-heparin complex activates platelets, generating platelet-derived procoagulant microparticles, thereby initiating thrombin generation and provoking a hypercoagulable state. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Heparin is commonly prescribed, but overdoses are rare. TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. The main sign of heparin overdose is bleeding.  Patients may experience epistaxis, hematuria, tarry stool, easy bruising, or petechial formation, followed by frank bleeding. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common complication observed with heparin therapy is bleeding (9% to 45%; common sites are gastrointestinal tract, skin, urinary tract, and pulmonary and cardiovascular systems). Cardiovascular collapse may occur with significant hemorrhage or cardiac tamponade. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an acquired hypercoagulability syndrome caused by the antibody-mediated reaction. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and a high risk for venous or arterial thrombosis, also referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). The overall incidence of HIT has been as high as 30% (type I HIT 2% to 25% and type II HIT 1% to 3%). The following thromboembolic events may occur: deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, and gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation. The following adverse effects have also been reported with heparin administration: hypotension, hematoma, ecchymoses, skin necrosis, reversible transaminase elevations, hypersensitivity reactions, eczema, generalized urticaria, hyperkalemia, chemosis, and hyphema. <br\/>"},{"id":"276980-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>HEPARIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor for bleeding. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. If hypotension persists, treat patients with vasopressors. SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat patients with severe bleeding with protamine sulfate. Transfusions of packed red blood cells and\/or fresh frozen plasma may be indicated in addition to protamine sulfate. In patients with strongly suspected or confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), with or without thrombosis, discontinue heparin and start an alternative, non-heparin anticoagulant (lepirudin, argatroban).  Treat severe hypotension with fluids (and transfusion if hypotension is secondary to bleeding) add vasopressors if necessary. An anaphylactoid or anaphylactic reaction may require aggressive airway management and support.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Decontamination is not indicated; heparin is only available parenterally.<\/li><li>Airway management: Assess airway; endotracheal intubation may be required in patients with intracranial bleeding, severe hemoptysis, or acute allergic reaction.<\/li><li>Antidote: PROTAMINE: If the bleeding tendency is severe or if massive amounts of heparin have been administered, treatment with protamine sulfate may be indicated. DOSE: ADULTS: 1 mg IV for every 100 units of heparin remaining in patient; if 30 minutes have elapsed since the injection of heparin, one-half the dose may be sufficient. Protamine sulfate should be given by slow intravenous administration over a 10 minute period (not to exceed 50 mg) to avoid the risk of severe adverse reactions such as hypotension and bradycardia. Dosing of protamine sulfate should be guided by anticoagulation studies. CHILDREN: The Seventh American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy Consensus Guidelines state that protamine sulfate can be considered for use in children if rapid reversal of heparin activity is required (eg, heparin-induced bleeding). If it has been less than 30 minutes since the last dose of heparin therapy, the recommended dose of protamine is 1 mg given IV for every 100 units. If 30 to 60 minutes have elapsed since last dose of heparin therapy, protamine 0.5 to 0.75 mg IV should be given for every 100 units of heparin received. If 60 to 120 minutes have elapsed since the last dose of heparin, protamine 0.375 to 0.5 mg IV should be given per every 100 units of heparin received. If more than 120 minutes have elapsed since the last dose of heparin, protamine 0.25 to 0.375 mg IV should be given per every 100 units of heparin received. The maximum dose of protamine sulfate is 50 mg, and can be administered in a concentration of 10 mg\/mL not exceeding 5 mg\/minute.<\/li><li>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: In patients with strongly suspected or confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), with or without thrombosis, discontinue heparin and start an alternative, non-heparin anticoagulant (lepirudin, argatroban). LEPIRUDIN: ADULTS: 0.4 mg\/kg (maximum 44 mg) IV bolus, at a concentration of 5 mg\/mL, is administered slowly (eg, over 15 to 20 seconds) followed by a continuous infusion of lepirudin at a rate of 0.15 mg\/kg\/hr (maximum initial infusion dose of 16.5 mg\/hr) for 2 to 10 days or longer if clinically needed. According to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, the initial lepirudin IV infusion should not exceed 0.1 mg\/kg\/hour (mg\/kg\/hr). Initial bolus dose is recommended either to be omitted or, in case of perceived life- or limb-threatening thrombosis, be given at 0.2 mg\/kg. ARGATROBAN: The recommended initial dose is 2 mcg\/kg\/min administered as a continuous infusion.  Dose can be adjusted as clinically indicated, not exceeding 10 mcg\/kg\/min, until the steady-state aPTT is 1.5 to 3 times the initial baseline value (not to exceed an aPTT of 100 seconds). CHILDREN: initial, 0.75 mcg\/kg\/min continuous IV infusion; adjust in increments of 0.1 to 0.25 mcg\/kg\/min to achieve aPTT of 1.5 to 3 times the initial baseline value (not to exceed 100 seconds). In the absence of any prospective comparative clinical trials, the choice between lepirudin and argatroban usually is based on their different elimination mechanisms. Lepirudin is cleared by the kidneys, so it is preferred in patients with liver disease. Argatroban is cleared by the liver, so it is preferred in patients with renal insufficiency. Other agents such as bivalirudin, danaparoid (not available in the United States), and fondaparinux have also been used in patients with HIT.<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: MILD to MODERATE EFFECTS: Monitor airway.

Treatment includes IV fluids and ECG monitoring.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor for evidence of bleeding (eg, venous access sites, urinary, gastrointestinal, vaginal). Monitor CBC with platelets, aPTT, PT or INR, in patients with evidence of bleeding following a significant exposure. Monitor vital signs, renal function and hepatic enzymes in symptomatic patients. Monitor for signs and symptoms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT), including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, or gangrene of the extremities; delayed HITT could occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Efforts to enhance elimination are not indicated as heparin is rapidly removed from the body.
