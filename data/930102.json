cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 6 years of age and older who have a G551D mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. PHARMACOLOGY: Ivacaftor potentiates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance protein (CFTR), specifically G551D-CFTR, resulting in increased chloride transport on the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: In a study evaluating the effect of ivacaftor on ECGs of healthy subjects, more patients developed dizziness and diarrhea after receiving repeated doses of ivacaftor (450 mg tablets every 12 hours for 4.5 days (9 doses)) compared with placebo. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (8% or greater): Headache, oropharyngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, rash, nausea, and dizziness. OTHER EFFECTS: Acne, elevated liver enzymes, myalgia, arthralgia, rhinitis, pharyngeal erythema, pleuritic pain, sinus congestion, and wheezing. <br\/>"},{"id":"930102-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IVACAFTOR<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary. Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, should be referred to a healthcare facility to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, hepatotoxicity, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
