with rituximab for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults when rituximab alone is appropriate therapy due to other comorbidities. Idelalisib is also used to treat relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). PHARMACOLOGY: Idelalisib is a kinase inhibitor that induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of malignant B-cells and primary tumor cells, resulting in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (20% OR GREATER): Diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, cough, pneumonia, abdominal pain, fever, chills, and rash. MOST COMMON LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES (30% OR GREATER): Neutropenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and elevated ALT and AST. OTHER EFFECTS: Peripheral edema, night sweats, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, colitis, stomatitis, decreased appetite, urinary tract infection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, decreased or increased lymphocyte count, decreased hemoglobin, acute allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, joint pain, asthenia, headache, insomnia, nasal congestion, bronchitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, dyspnea, sepsis, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), intestinal perforation, hepatotoxicity, and pneumonitis. DRUG INTERACTION: Concomitant use of idelalisib (a CYP3A4 substrate) and a CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase idelalisib exposure and increase the risk of adverse effects. <br\/>"},{"id":"931009-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IDELALISIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Myelosuppression has been reported with therapeutic doses. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory symptoms or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors if patients develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. In patients with an idelalisib overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum idelalisib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice. Monitor vital signs, serum electrolytes and liver enzymes after significant overdose. Monitor serial CBC with differential. In patients with neutropenia, monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor pulse oximetry and\/or arterial blood gases in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms. Obtain a chest x-ray in patients with respiratory signs and symptoms to help evaluate for pneumonitis\/pneumonia.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (83%) and large volume of distribution (23 L).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestion of one extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than one extra dose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours) and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance or severe respiratory distress should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.
