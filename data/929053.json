PHARMACOLOGY: These agents decrease hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and increase peripheral glucose uptake. TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after acute overdose, as they do not stimulate insulin release. Severe lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially fatal side effect mainly in patients with renal insufficiency, hepatic disease, alcoholism, and advanced age. It can be precipitated by iodinated contrast agents. Metformin inhibits both hepatic lactate uptake and conversion of lactate to glucose. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but severe toxicity is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and myalgia. Acute pancreatitis has been reported in one case report. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe lactic acidosis, confusion, mental status depression, hypothermia, hypotension, and renal failure may develop.  Rarely, ventricular dysrhythmias, respiratory insufficiency, and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal pain, anorexia, headache, and rash. SERIOUS EFFECTS: Lactic acidosis (generally only in patients with renal insufficiency or hepatic disease) and megaloblastic anemia. Hypotension, ventricular extrasystoles, and myocardial infarction have been reported with therapeutic doses. DRUG INTERACTION: Use of radiocontrast dyes in patients taking metformin increases the risk of renal failure and acidosis.  Concurrent use of metformin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of renal failure and acidosis.<br\/><\/li><li><b>REPAGLINIDE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>USES: These hypoglycemic agents are of the meglitinide class and used for the treatment of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus. PHARMACOLOGY: Stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas via inhibition (closing) of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in beta cells of the pancreas, which leads to an increase in beta-cell calcium influx and resultant increase in insulin secretion. Functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets are required for this action. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive insulin secretion after overdose can cause hypoglycemia. EPIDEMIOLOGY: There have been limited reports of exposure and no reported deaths. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose experience with repaglinide and nateglinide is very limited though there are reports of hypoglycemia after nateglinide overdose and after therapeutic doses of repaglinide. Symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycemia include sweating, pallor, palpitations, tachycardia, lethargy, and dizziness. SEVERE TOXICITY: Symptoms of severe hypoglycemia include seizures, confusion, metabolic acidosis, coma and death. Since the meglitinides are more rapid and short-acting than sulfonylureas, there is a reduced risk of long-lasting hypoglycemia, but it is important to remember that relapse of hypoglycemia can occur after apparent recovery. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Mild GI effects (ie, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation) have been reported. There have been several reports of acute hepatitis occurring in elderly patients following repaglinide therapy.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929053-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>METFORMIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive care is the mainstay of treatment in patients who present with mild to moderate biguanide toxicity. Hypoglycemia from coingestion of other hypoglycemic agents should be managed with dextrose administration. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Early intubation and ventilation assistance should be performed if the patient presents with respiratory or mental status depression. Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if patient presents with circulatory collapse. If the patient develops severe anion gap metabolic acidosis or severe lactic acidosis (pH 7.1 or less), intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, then titrate to correct pH to above 7.2) should be given and emergent hemodialysis should be arranged (especially if renal insufficiency exists).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be considered after large ingestions, if the patient has an appropriate level of consciousness, patent airway, and the patient can drink the charcoal. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient presents early after large ingestion, if the patient has an appropriate level of consciousness, patent airway, and can drink the charcoal.  Severe toxicity is rare; gastric lavage is rarely if ever indicated.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe lactic acidosis who present with respiratory insufficiency or mental status depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypoglycemia: Give dextrose if symptomatic or BS &lt;60 mg\/dL. Dose - Adult 50 mL of 50% dextrose IV push; Child 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (2-4 mL\/kg) of 25% dextrose IV push. Follow with an infusion of 10% dextrose; titrate to a BS of 100 mg\/dL.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No labs are needed in case of small ingestions. Patients with larger ingestions should have serial (every 2 hours) monitoring of serum electrolytes and lactate. Monitor arterial blood gases in patients with metabolic acidosis. Monitor renal function and liver enzymes.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis  is effective in improving acid-base status and may improve clinical outcome in patients with severe lactic acidosis, especially in patients with renal insufficiency, however, it does not remove significant amounts of metformin because of its large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children with acute inadvertent ingestions of 1700 mg or less may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Four to 6 hours of observation period is recommended after immediate-release metformin overdose. Peak concentrations of delayed-release formulations are expected to be delayed after overdose. After an overdose, patients should be observed for the development of toxic effects for 2 to 6 hours longer than the Tmax (Tmax: Glucophage XR 7 hours, Glumetza extended-release: 7 to 8 hours. Fortamet extended-release: 6 hours). Patients who remain asymptomatic during this period with no evidence of metabolic acidosis or hypoglycemia can be discharged home. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity, or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>REPAGLINIDE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Monitor blood glucose hourly. Treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. Treat patients with recurrent hypoglycemia with octreotide. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite treatment with octreotide, feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia. DIET: If the patient is awake and alert, supplement IV glucose with carbohydrate intake. Potassium supplementation may be needed. NOT RECOMMENDED: Prophylactic dextrose administration is not recommended in patients who do not become hypoglycemic, as it may make it difficult to distinguish patients who become hypoglycemic and require prolonged hospitalization from those who remain asymptomatic and may be discharged sooner. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Monitor blood glucose hourly. Treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. Treat patients with recurrent hypoglycemia with octreotide. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite treatment with octreotide, feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia. Patients with persistent or recurring hypoglycemia may develop CNS depression and seizures. Correct hypoglycemia, if seizures are present. If seizures persist, treat with benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients with recent, potentially toxic ingestions who are awake and able to protect their airway. Most effective when administered within one hour of ingestion. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients with recent, potentially toxic ingestions who are awake and able to protect their airway. Most effective when administered within one hour of ingestion. Gastric lavage is generally not recommended as life threatening toxicity is not expected to develop.<\/li><li>Airway management: Generally, airway management is not necessary as CNS depression from these agents should resolve with dextrose administration. Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with excessive drowsiness and the inability to protect their own airway that do not respond to intravenous dextrose.<\/li><li>Hypoglycemia: DEXTROSE: Give dextrose if symptomatic or BS less than 60 mg\/dL. DOSE: ADULT: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg of D50W (50% dextrose) IV push; ADOLESCENT: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (1 to 2 mL\/kg) of 50% dextrose IV push; INFANT and CHILD: 0.5 to 1 g\/kg (2 to 4 mL\/kg) of 25% dextrose IV push. Follow with an infusion of 10% dextrose; titrate to a BS of 100 mg\/dL. OCTREOTIDE: (a long-acting analogue of somatostatin which antagonizes insulin release) has been used in sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. The use of octreotide for repaglinide-induced hypoglycemia has not been described, but the mechanism suggests that it should be effective. OCTREOTIDE DOSE: ADULT: 50 mcg SubQ (usual route) or IV; may repeat every 6 to 12 hours as needed. CHILD: 1 mcg\/kg SubQ (usual route) or IV; may repeat every 12 hours as needed. GLUCAGON: It may be of limited value and is usually not recommended in the treatment of hypoglycemia caused by repaglinide, except when treatment with glucose is not available or possible. Due to the short half-life of glucagon, repeated hypoglycemia may occur. Oral carbohydrate or IV dextrose should be given as soon as possible. Glucagon is of little benefit in the presence of starvation, adrenal insufficiency, liver disease, alcoholism or chronic hypoglycemia given depletion of hepatic glycogen stores. It may cause nausea and vomiting and stimulation of hepatic ketogenesis. DIET: When the patient is awake and alert, supplement IV glucose with carbohydrate intake.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are usually manifestations of hypoglycemia; correct with IV dextrose. If seizures persist despite euglycemia, anticonvulsants (ie. benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol) are indicated.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain hourly blood glucose; monitor blood glucose for 8 to 12 hours. Monitor vital signs. Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance in symptomatic patients. Plasma levels are not clinically useful for managing overdose. Monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of value due to the high degree of protein binding with these agents.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: All children with ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Adults with a deliberate overdose and nondiabetic adults with an inadvertent ingestion should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Diabetic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of an extra dose who are asymptomatic can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: There is little information on the onset or duration of hypoglycemia after overdose of these patients; however, delayed onset hypoglycemia is not expected given the rapid absorption and relatively short duration of onset of these drugs. Patients who do not develop hypoglycemia after 8 to 12 hours of observation can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop hypoglycemia should be admitted for a minimum of 24 hours for frequent blood glucose monitoring. They should only be discharged when free of symptoms and are able to maintain euglycemia without supplemental dextrose for 8 hours. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or a poison center for assistance with medical management in patients with severe overdose or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929053-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>METFORMIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The minimum toxic dose is not well established. ADULT: In adults, ingestions of 5 g or less are generally well tolerated. Severe toxicity developed after ingestions of 25 or more of metformin. A woman ingested 75 to 100 grams of metformin and developed severe lactic acidosis. Following aggressive supportive care, her condition improved gradually. An elderly adult survived an intentional ingestion of 63 grams of metformin and developed no permanent sequelae. PEDIATRIC: Ingestions of up to 1700 mg of metformin were well tolerated in healthy children. A 15-year-old girl developed lactic acidosis and acute renal failure after ingesting 38.25 g (0.55 g\/kg body weight) of metformin. She recovered completely following supportive care. A 15-year-old girl developed lactic acidosis, hypotension, and recurrent and severe hypoglycemia, requiring boluses of 50% dextrose after ingesting 75 g of metformin and 3 g of quetiapine in a suicide attempt. She recovered following supportive care. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Immediate-release form: 1000 to 2550 mg orally daily in 2 to 3 divided doses; maximum: 2550 mg\/day.

Doses up to 80 mg\/day for 14 days have been well tolerated in adults with diabetes. No hypoglycemia was reported when these high doses were taken with meals. NATEGLINIDE: Ingestion of 3420 mg by a nondiabetic adult caused hypoglycemia that began 1 hour after ingestion. Doses up to 720 mg daily for 7 days have been tolerated in diabetic patients. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: REPAGLINIDE: ADULT: There is no fixed dosage regimen. The recommended dose range is 0.5 to 4 mg daily (given before meals); maximum total daily dose should not exceed 16 mg. PEDIATRIC: Efficacy and safety in pediatric patients have not been established. NATEGLINIDE: ADULT: Recommended starting and maintenance dose, alone or in combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione, is 60 mg to 120 mg orally 3 times daily before meals.
