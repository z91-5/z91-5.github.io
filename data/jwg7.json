are primarily used for the treatment of Parkinson disease. A transdermal formulation of selegiline is used for depression. The 2 MAO-BIs approved for use in the United States are selegiline and rasagiline. For information on nonselective MAOIs (eg, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine), refer to \"Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO)\" management. For information on selective inhibitors of MAO-A (eg,  moclobemide), please refer to \"Reversible MAO-A Inhibitors\" management. PHARMACOLOGY: MAO-B is present in the brain in dopaminergic raphe neurons, platelets, and pancreas. MAO-BIs inhibit the function of MAO-B, preventing the degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine). Selegiline and rasagiline are irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme. TOXICOLOGY: In general, MAO-B selective inhibitors are much less toxic than nonspecific MAO inhibitors. There are no reported deaths from selegiline or rasagiline overdose. Theoretically, at high doses, MAO type selectivity may be lost and MAO-A may be inhibited as well. This could lead to excessive catecholamines and a hyperadrenergic state. Toxicity may occur after an overdose or when MAOIs are combined with other drugs with MAO or serotonergic activity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose of MAO-BIs is uncommon and severe effects or deaths are extremely rare. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: There are no quality reports of significant toxicity following MAO-B selective inhibitors overdose. However, there is a theoretical risk of tachycardia, mild hypertension, anxiety, flushing, and headache in patients with mild to moderate toxicity. SEVERE POISONING: There are no quality reports of significant toxicity following MAO-B selective inhibitors overdose. However, it is possible that a large overdose could present with symptoms similar to a nonselective MAOI overdose. Based on what is known about nonselective MAOI overdose, these effects might include hyperadrenergic symptoms, such as severe tachycardia and hypertension, diaphoresis, delirium, seizures, dysrhythmias, and possibly cardiovascular collapse and coma, may occur. Serotonin syndrome is another theoretical complication from MAO-BI toxicity. It presents with a triad of autonomic instability (ie, hyperthermia, hypertension, hypotension), neuromuscular excitability (ie, clonus and rigidity), and altered mental status that may be thought of as a spectrum of symptoms. Multiorgan failure and death may result from any of these complications. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Orthostatic hypotension, anorexia, nausea, dyspepsia, dyskinesia, hallucinations, and headache are reported. Selegiline is converted to L-methamphetamine and may cause hypertension and tachycardia following therapeutic dosing. Because most MAOIs are irreversible, symptoms may persist for weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Rasagiline, a secondary cyclic benzylamine propargylamine derivative, has no amphetamine metabolites and therefore, sympathomimetic adverse events are not anticipated. Dyskinesia has been reported with rasagiline therapy. DRUG INTERACTION: Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine may augment catecholamine release and cause or exacerbate toxicity when taken with MAOIs. Serotonin syndrome may be precipitated by coadministration with other serotonergic agents such as illicit drugs (eg, ecstacy\/MDMA), medications (eg, dextromethorphan, SSRIs, meperidine), and herbal supplements (eg, St John's Wort). There is no evidence that tyramine reactions occur in patients taking MAO-BI.<br\/>"},{"id":"jwg7s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MAO-B INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: All patients with symptoms of MAOI toxicity should be evaluated by a health care professional. Symptoms may persist for several weeks due to the irreversibility of MAO inhibition caused by these medications. Discontinuation of the offending agents and patient education involving drug interactions should be provided to all symptomatic patients. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Careful attention to the ABCs (airway, breathing and circulation) should guide symptomatic and supportive treatment, which is the mainstay of MAOI toxicity management. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of coma or severe toxicity, especially for patients that are agitated with hyperthermia. Recognition and treatment of hyperthermia, hypertension, seizures, end-organ damage, and muscular rigidity is paramount. There is no antidote for MAOI toxicity.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: As MAO-BI overdoses are generally not serious, there is no role for prehospital decontamination following oral exposure. Search for and remove any transdermal patches from the patient's body. Patches are often under clothing and can be found on the back, chest or upper arm. HOSPITAL: Consider decontamination if a patient presents shortly (eg, within 1 to 2 hours) after a large oral ingestion and is not manifesting symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients that are manifesting signs of toxicity as they may become comatose or seize and lose their airway. If the airway is protected with orotracheal intubation, charcoal may be given. However, it is still possible that a patient may aspirate around the endotracheal tube. Whole bowel irrigation should be considered if there is a clear ingestion of a transdermal preparation. Gastric lavage is not indicated as serious toxicity is rare.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (coma, respiratory depression, severe agitation).<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Delirium: Liberal use of benzodiazepines is recommended until the patient is no longer agitated.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: If the patient is agitated, hypertension may respond to sedation with benzodiazepines. For severe hypertension, an alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist, such as phentolamine, or a mixed alpha and beta antagonist, such as labetalol, may be used. Rapid-acting, easily titrated vasodilators such as nitroglycerin and nitroprusside are also good choices.<\/li><li>Tachycardia: Tachycardia may occur from a combination of agitation and catecholamine release. Treat with benzodiazepines. Pure beta blockade should generally be avoided in these patients, as it may exacerbate hypertension due to unopposed alpha activity.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Treat the patient aggressively with benzodiazepines and cooling, if needed. Cyproheptadine may be considered (seek guidance from a toxicologist prior to administering).<\/li><li>Hyperthermia treatment: Hyperthermia can result form psychomotor agitation, increased neuromuscular activity or persistent seizures. Sedate the patient with benzodiazepines and place in a quiet, dark environment. Other cooling measures can include cool mist and fans, or packing the body in ice; consider ice water immersion for severe hyperthermia. Neuromuscular paralysis of the patient may be necessary for severe hyperthermia.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Follow ACLS protocols.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures may be a result of excessive catecholamine release. Treatment includes intravenous benzodiazepines; add propofol or barbiturates if seizures recur. If seizures persist, intubate and paralyze the patient. Continuous EEG monitoring is indicated. Consider a CT scan of the head to rule out intracranial hemorrhage.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Mild orthostatic hypotension is common with therapeutic use. Severe hypotension is rare, but may occur as a late and ominous finding, as a result of cardiac collapse. Hypotension should be treated with an initial bolus of NS, if the patient can tolerate a fluid load, followed by adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure as needed. Direct agents (norepinephrine) are preferred to indirect agents (dopamine), because indirect pressors rely on catecholamine release from sympathetic neurons.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. MAO-BI plasma concentrations are not clinically useful or readily available. Screening urine toxicology immunoassays will not detect MAOIs. Selegiline is converted to amphetamine which may be detected on a urine toxicology screen. In symptomatic patients, obtain a basic chemistry profile, lactate, CPK, ECG, renal function, and coagulation panel. Obtain cardiac enzymes in patients with chest pain. Consider head CT and lumbar puncture to rule out intracranial mass, bleeding, or infection in patients with altered mental status.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than therapeutic dose, or if they are symptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or children with inadvertent ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for observation for 6 to 8 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent hypertension, tachycardia or central nervous depression should be admitted to the hospital. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, hyperthermia, or delirium should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jwg7s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MAO-B INHIBITORS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose varies widely, depending on the specific agent.
