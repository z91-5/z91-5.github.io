The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects, including myelosuppression, and QTc prolongation with the potential for ventricular dysrhythmias. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common adverse effects, following therapeutic administration of nilotinib, include rash, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, and headache. Myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and QT interval prolongation have also been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"jwr7s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>NILOTINIB <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: In case of overdose, treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion if the patient is able to maintain airway or if airway is protected.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: There is little data on the use of hematopoietic colony stimulating factors to treat neutropenia.
