PHARMACOLOGY: These drugs are fungistatic and may be fungicidal, depending on concentration. Imidazoles inhibit biosynthesis of ergosterol or other sterols, damaging the fungal cell membrane and altering its permeability.  As a result, loss of essential intracellular elements may occur. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose experience is limited with these agents.  Due to minimal oral absorption and limited systemic toxicity, severe toxic effects following oral overdose is not anticipated. Ingestion of even large quantities should produce only minor GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  ADVERSE EFFECTS: Allergic contact dermatitis to these agents is rare but has been reported.  Following dermal applications, pruritus, erythema, stinging, urticaria and localized edema have been reported. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequent side effects following oral administration of clotrimazole. Elevated liver enzymes have rarely been reported following the use of clotrimazole troches and sertaconazole 2% topical cream. Drowsiness and disorientation have been reported following oral clotrimazole therapy. Headache may infrequently occur following therapeutic use of these agents. <br\/>"},{"id":"128200-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IMIDAZOLE ANTIFUNGALS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Toxicity due to these agents is negligible.
