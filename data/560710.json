It is used to treat atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias. PHARMACOLOGY: Sotalol is a beta-blocker which has both beta adrenoreceptor blocking and cardiac action potential duration prolongation effects. Sotalol is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar class III antiarrhythmic effects while the l-isomer is responsible for the nearly all of the beta-blocking activity. The beta-blocking effect of sotalol is noncardioselective with both beta-1 and beta-2-receptor blocking activity. Vaughan Williams Class III effects are seen only at larger doses (greater than or equal to 160 mg\/day or more in adults). TOXICOLOGY: Overdose causes beta-adrenergic blockade and lengthening of action potential duration, which predisposes patients to torsades de pointes and ventricular dysrhythmias. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Sotalol overdoses are fairly rare, but can result in severe dysrhythmias and death. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate overdose can cause bradycardia, mild hypotension, and a prolonged QTc interval. SEVERE TOXICITY: Clinical events can include: syncope, CNS depression, seizures, hypotension, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects seen at therapeutic doses include bradycardia, chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, and dyspnea. Other less common adverse effects include: edema, hypotension, syncope, congestive heart failure, torsades de pointes, peripheral vascular disorders, headaches, sleeping problems, mental confusion, anxiety, depression, pruritus, rash, decreased sexual ability, nausea and\/or vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, flatulence, impotence, bleeding, extremity pain, paresthesia, back pain, visual problems, upper respiratory problems, and asthma. RARE: There have been rare reports of adverse effects including alopecia, paralysis, and pulmonary edema. <br\/>"},{"id":"560710-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SOTALOL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate sotalol exposures require only symptomatic and supportive care. Patients can be monitored via a cardiac monitor and fluids can be given for hypotension and atropine for symptomatic bradycardia. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Intubate patients with severe toxicity early. Primary focus is treatment of ventricular dysrhythmias and hypotension. Cardiovert unstable ventricular dysrhythmias. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium, overdrive pacing is second-line therapy. Treat hypotension initially with IV fluids, add vasopressors, if unresponsive. Consider glucagon, calcium and insulin euglycemia if hypotension persists, although experience is limited.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of the potential for hemodynamic instability, somnolence and seizures. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal if recent, substantial ingestion, and patient is cooperative and able to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (depressed mental status, seizures, dysrhythmias).<\/li><li>Antidote: No specific antidote exists.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Initial management can be with fluids (500 mL boluses up to 3L) and atropine if patient is bradycardic. Catecholamines should be given those who do not respond to IV fluids. No one agent has been shown to be consistently effective, though there is some data suggesting that norepinephrine or epinephrine might be more effective than dopamine. Glucagon can also be given. Initial dosing is 5 to 15 mg by slow IV administration with doses repeated as needed. An infusion of the initial dose that elicited a response per hour may then be administered. HIE (high dose insulin euglycemia) is another potential therapy, though there is little experience with sotalol overdose. Insulin dose: A bolus of insulin at 1 unit\/kg concomitantly with 25 g glucose and then an insulin infusion of 0.5 to 1 unit\/kg\/hr with a dextrose infusion (D10 in an adult) with frequent monitoring of blood glucose to maintain euglycemia. Monitor for hypokalemia and supplement potassium as needed.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Cardiovert unstable rhythms. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Treat with magnesium sulfate IV. Dose: Adult: 1 to 2 g IV over 5 minutes, may repeat once, then an infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr; Pediatric: 25 to 50 mg\/kg over 5 to 15 min up to 2 g maximum. Overdrive pacing if not responding to magnesium.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Cardiovert unstable rhythms. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Lidocaine may be used if dysrhythmias persist. Use amiodarone with caution as it can cause torsades de pointes.<\/li><li>Extracorporeal perfusion: EXTRACORPOREAL SUPPORT: For patients with intractable dysrhythmias or hypotension, consider cardiopulmonary bypass, intra-aortic balloon pump, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation early to preserve perfusion until severe toxicity abates.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are most often secondary to dysrhythmias and hypotension. Once these are treated, use benzodiazepine, add barbiturates or propofol, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs to evaluate for QTc prolongation. Monitor serum electrolytes including magnesium and calcium, renal function and blood glucose. Specific sotalol plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Sotalol is not protein bound and has a moderate volume of distribution (1 to 2 L\/kg). It is removed by hemodialysis, and dialysis has been shown to shorten half-life in patients with renal failure. Hemodialysis has been used in a case of overdose. Consider emergent hemodialysis in patients with large ingestions or severe toxicity, although unstable dysrhythmias or hypotension may make dialysis difficult.<\/li><li>Patient disposition:  HOME CRITERIA: Healthy asymptomatic patients (including children) who inadvertently ingest less than or equal to a maximum single therapeutic dose for age (up to 160 mg in adults, or 4 mg\/kg in children) may be observed at home and referred to a health care facility if symptoms develop. Torsades de pointes has been reported in adults after therapeutic doses, although many of these patients had concomitant conditions (electrolyte abnormalities, cardiac disease, use of drugs that cause QT prolongation) that may have predisposed them to dysrhythmias. Patients with a sotalol overdose who have an underlying cardiovascular disease or predisposing risk factors (ie, other antidysrhythmic drugs, diuretics) should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with serious underlying cardiac disease, those taking a calcium channel blocker, and any patient with a deliberate ingestion should be referred to a healthcare facility. Inadvertent ingestions in adults who ingest greater than 160 mg and children who ingest greater than 4 mg\/kg should be referred to a healthcare facility. All patients should be monitored for 12 hours. If asymptomatic with a normal ECG during this time, they may be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, bradycardia), central nervous system toxicity (somnolence, seizures, coma) or persistent QTc prolongation should be admitted to an intensive care setting. Symptomatic patients should be admitted for further observation\/treatment until they are asymptomatic for a prolonged period (several hours) of time without therapy. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (ie, hypotension, seizures, dysrhythmias), or in whom the diagnosis in not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"560710-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>SOTALOL <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Adults who ingest greater than 160 mg and children who ingest greater than 4 mg\/kg have the potential to develop toxicity.
