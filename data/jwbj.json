PHARMACOLOGY: These agents are GABA receptor (benzodiazepine receptor-chloride iron channel complex) agonists, which bind to a non-benzodiazepine specific site. The metabolite of zopiclone called desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicity is an extension of the pharmacology, causing CNS depression. Deaths are very rare following single substance ingestions. EPIDEMIOLOGY:  In the United States, zopiclone is not commercially available, although its active stereoisomer, eszopiclone is available. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose may present with drowsiness, ataxia, lethargy, and sedation. SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with a massive overdose or mixed ingestion may present with excessive sedation and depressed respiratory function which may progress to coma.  Severe overdoses may result in hypoxia, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. Methemoglobinemia and renal insufficiency have been reported rarely after very large zopiclone overdoses. One patient with a history of hepatic insufficiency developed coronary artery vasospasm, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and ventricular fibrillation after eszopiclone overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects include taste disturbances (eg, bitter metallic taste), dry mouth, disruption of REM sleep, double vision, drowsiness, memory impairments, visuospatial impairments, dizziness, headaches, and fatigue. Unexpected mood changes have been observed, which requires drug cessation. Tolerance and dependence may develop; seizures have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of chronic high doses of zopiclone. DRUG INTERACTIONS: More severe toxicity is expected when coingested with other CNS depressants such as opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or ethanol. <br\/>"},{"id":"jwbjs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ZOPICLONE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients will require little more than monitoring and positioning to maintain the airway and avoid aspiration. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity generally occurs if other sedating agents are also ingested. Intubate patients with any difficulty maintaining their airway or who are at risk for aspiration. Hypotension is generally mild and responds to fluids. Administer methylene blue to patients with symptomatic methemoglobinemia or concentrations above 30%.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is not recommended because of potential for somnolence and loss of airway protection. HOSPITAL: In general, decontamination is not indicated for this overdose, but may be considered for massive overdoses that present early. Activated charcoal could be considered if the patient is awake and cooperative and if the ingestion was relatively recent.  Gastric lavage is not indicated as overdose is not life-threatening. There is no evidence for the use of whole bowel irrigation or multiple doses of charcoal.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway protection is required in patients with an altered mental status.<\/li><li>Antidote: Flumazenil has been used to reverse sedation due to zopiclone or eszopiclone. However, since toxicity is so mild, it is rarely required. Routine use of flumazenil is NOT recommended. Flumazenil may be useful in establishing a diagnosis in a patient with CNS depression and possibly in preventing the need for respiratory support. Flumazenil should not be administered to patients with cardiac arrhythmias, seizures or a history of seizures, signs\/symptoms of a cyclic antidepressant intoxication, or a suspected multidrug ingestion.<\/li><li>Coma: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Perform orotracheal intubation to protect the airway.  Evaluate for other causes of coma (eg, hypoglycemia, coingestants, metabolic derangements).<\/li><li>Respiratory arrest: Respiratory depression may occur with very large overdoses or in mixed overdoses with other sedatives, and can be treated with intubation and mechanical ventilation.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for enhanced removal procedures such as dialysis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Quantitative drug estimation is not readily available and not indicated in the routine management. Zopiclone and eszopiclone are not detected as benzodiazepines on most urine drug screens. In patients with altered mental status, obtain a metabolic panel, serum glucose, and possibly a head CT, if the diagnosis is in doubt. Obtain a methemoglobin concentration in patients with cyanosis or respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients (other than mild drowsiness) with inadvertent ingestions may be monitored at home.  Children inadvertently ingesting 1 or 2 tablets may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a small overdose who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic can be managed and observed in the emergency department for a short period (4 to 6 hours). ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who are heavily sedated or respiratory depressed due to eszopiclone or a mixed ingestion (usually opioid and alcohol), should be treated appropriately and admitted if they are expected to have prolonged course of CNS or respiratory depression. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (coma, respiratory depression), or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jwbjs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ZOPICLONE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: These drugs have a very wide therapeutic index, and high safety profile similar to oral benzodiazepines. Adults have survived ingestions of up 3750 mg zopiclone with supportive care. A young woman with a history of chronic zopiclone abuse ingested 500 tablets of zopiclone 7.5 mg (total, 3750 mg) over 5 hours and developed dizziness, cyanosis, and methemoglobinemia. She recovered in less than 24 hours of ingestion following a single dose (50 mg) of methylene blue. An adult with a history of hepatic insufficiency and ethanol abuse developed a myocardial infarction secondary to vasospasm, complicated by ventricular fibrillation after ingesting 60 mg eszopiclone, but recovered.  Adults with chronic respiratory debilitation lor advance lung cancer have died after ingestions of zopiclone in the range of 90 to 450 mg.
