PHARMACOLOGY: Chlorambucil is an aromatic nitrogen mustard derivative and alkylating agent that interferes with DNA replication and induces cellular apoptosis by accumulation of cytosolic p53 and activation of the apoptosis promoter, BAX. TOXICOLOGY: After an overdose, the effects of decreased DNA synthesis and cell death are noticed primarily in organ systems with rapidly dividing cells (bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare, but can be life-threatening. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited; effects are likely an extension of adverse events. Excessive dosage or prolonged administration can induce severe myelosuppression. Patients who receive a total of 6.5 mg\/kg or more in one course of therapy with continuous dosing are most likely to develop severe neutropenia. Nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, agitation, irritability, ataxia, muscle twitching, seizures, lethargy, myoclonus, and coma have also been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity of chlorambucil and has an onset of 1 to 14 days.  Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported.  Blood counts continue to fall after discontinuing therapy; a nadir is usually reached in 10 days to 2 weeks. Bone marrow effects are most often reversible; however, irreversible bone marrow failure has been reported.  INFREQUENT: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and oral ulceration. RARE: Tremors, muscular twitching, myoclonus, confusion, agitation, ataxia, flaccid paresis, hallucinations, seizures, skin hypersensitivity reactions (eg, rashes, urticaria, angioedema, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, jaundice, drug fever, peripheral neuropathy, and interstitial pneumonia. <br\/>"},{"id":"2js1s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CHLORAMBUCIL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) after large overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. <\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression or persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the ingestion is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe CNS or respiratory symptoms or acute allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. For example: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor renal function and liver enzymes. Monitor serum electrolytes. Monitor serial CBC with differential with platelet count. Myelosuppression (eg, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pancytopenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of chlorambucil and has an onset of 1 to 14 days. Blood counts continue to fall after discontinuing therapy; a nadir is usually reached in 10 days to 2 weeks. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of benefit due to high protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with a chlorambucil overdose need to be admitted, as toxicity develops over several days. Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with a chlorambucil overdose. In addition, consultation with an infectious disease physician with expertise in the management of neutropenic patients with infections is strongly recommended.
