PHARMACOLOGY: Partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, antagonist at the kappa opioid receptor. TOXICOLOGY: The toxicity is an extension of the pharmacology. Effects include CNS depression, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. Hypotension can occur from mast cell G protein activation and subsequent degranulation of histamine-containing vesicles. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Buprenorphine exposures are common. In adults, severe toxicity may occur from crushing and injecting tablets, but is not common after ingesting buprenorphine alone. Children are at risk for toxicity following ingestion of less than a single tablet. While most deaths are due to overdose, deaths following inadvertent ingestion have occurred. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Miosis, sedation, and relative bradycardia. Hepatitis is reported rarely. SEVERE POISONING: CNS depression, coma, respiratory depression, and hypotension. Children, in particular, may develop profound, recurrent, or delayed CNS and respiratory depression. In adults, severe effects are generally only seen after crushing and injecting tablets, or after very large ingestions. Acute renal failure is reported rarely. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Sedation, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, and withdrawal syndrome. At high doses, buprenorphine's agonist effects plateau (&quot;ceiling effect&quot;), limiting the maximum analgesic and respiratory depressant effects. Due to this &quot;ceiling effect,&quot; patients who are chronic users\/abusers of opioids can experience withdrawal after ingestion of buprenorphine.<br\/><\/li><li><b>NALOXONE <\/b><br\/>USES: Naloxone is used to reverse the effects of opioid medications and is indicated for the reversal of life threatening respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdose. It is also used in combination with other agents as an abuse deterrent. PHARMACOLOGY: Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that competes with and displaces narcotics at opioid receptor sites. TOXICOLOGY: The antagonistic effects of naloxone at opioid receptors may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose of naloxone is rare. It is used commonly in a variety of settings including prehospital care settings, emergency departments, and operating rooms. OVERDOSE: Naloxone is not a drug of abuse and there is essentially no overdose phenomenon. Increased blood pressure may occur following overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The adverse effects of naloxone are related to its antagonistic effects to narcotics and the resulting withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms include pain, hypertension, diaphoresis, piloerection, muscle cramping, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and agitation. Pulmonary edema and dysrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in association with the use of naloxone. There have also been reports of acute lung injury, seizures, dysphagia, urinary urgency, and increases of cortisol and growth hormone. NEONATES: In neonates, withdrawal symptoms also include excessive crying, hyperactive reflexes, and convulsions.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jycls12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>BUPRENORPHINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: For patients who have CNS depression without airway compromise or respiratory depression, close monitoring and supplemental oxygen and supportive care is usually all that is required. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care (intravenous crystalloid, supplemental oxygen, and assisted ventilation), may be required. Naloxone can be given for respiratory depression in order to eliminate the need for intubation.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient can reliably protect their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: Naloxone (adults and children): initial dose 1 mg IV, may repeat. High doses of naloxone (10 to 35 mg in adults) have been used to reverse respiratory depression induced by buprenorphine. The peak effect of naloxone reversal may also be delayed (up to 30 minutes in some cases).<\/li><li>Decreased respiratory function: Bag valve mask ventilation and naloxone; endotracheal intubation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Supplemental oxygen; PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Intravenous crystalloid; if hypotension persists, administer dopamine or norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, respiratory effort, and mental status. Monitor arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, and renal function in patients with severe poisoning. Obtain a chest x-ray in patients with clinical evidence of pulmonary edema. Routine urine toxicology opioid assays generally do not detect buprenorphine.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for enhanced elimination techniques.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management of inadvertent buprenorphine ingestion in children, as significant toxicity has resulted after ingestion of half a tablet. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or children with any ingestion should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation. All symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation. All patients should be monitored for a minimum of 12 to 24 hours due to the potential for delayed or recurrent respiratory and CNS depression. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All symptomatic patients should be admitted. Patients with significant persistent CNS depression or those with respiratory depression or hypotension should be admitted to an intensive care setting. Patients requiring multiple doses of naloxone or those who are on a naloxone infusion should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (coma, severe CNS depression, respiratory failure or severe hypotension), or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>NALOXONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treatment of mild to moderate withdrawal induced by naloxone includes the use of benzodiazepines for agitation and antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. Because naloxone has a short duration of action compared with most opioids, no further treatment is generally needed. In mild cases, symptoms usually subside within 1 to 2 hours. Clonidine has also been used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine has been used to treat diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include benzodiazepines for agitation and antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. Because naloxone has a short duration of action compared with most opioids, no further treatment is generally needed. In mild cases, symptoms usually subside within 1 to 2 hours. Clonidine has also been used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine to treat diarrhea. If pulmonary edema develops, oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure, or endotracheal intubation may be required. Seizures should be treated with standard antiepileptic agents such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route. HOSPITAL: Because naloxone is not active orally, gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation. Provide bilevel positive airway pressure as required and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with pulmonary edema or serious toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension does not usually require treatment. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside or phentolamine are preferred, with nitroglycerin or labetalol as alternatives.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No laboratory studies are needed after naloxone use or overdose unless otherwise clinically indicated. Naloxone concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful. Monitor respiratory and mental status when naloxone is used to reverse opioid toxicity.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Naloxone exposures in general should be very safe. Asymptomatic patients may remain at home with inadvertent exposures to naloxone alone. However, if naloxone was administered to reverse opioid toxicity, the patient should be brought in to a health care facility for further evaluation. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who are symptomatic, those with deliberate overdose, and patients in whom naloxone was used to reverse opioid toxicity should be referred to a health care facility for evaluation and observation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with pulmonary edema or those who are persistently symptomatic should be admitted. Admission is almost never necessary.

CHILD: Ingestion of 4 mg (one-half of a single 8 mg tablet; 0.215 mg\/kg) can cause profound respiratory and CNS depression in a toddler. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULTS: 12 to 16 mg\/day sublingual; 0.3 mg IM or slow IV up to every 6 hours; doses up to 0.6 mg (IM only) depending on the severity of pain. CHILDREN (2 to 12 years): 2 to 6 mcg\/kg every 4 to 6 hours IV or IM.<br\/><\/li><li><b>NALOXONE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: There is no specific known toxic dose with naloxone, though deaths have occurred in varying doses associated with its use. However, these case reports do not provide any direct evidence that the use of naloxone was solely responsible for mortality. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT: Standard dosing in adults may range widely, as the drug should be titrated to effect. Initial IV doses usually range from 0.1 to 2 mg, which may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes. Additional doses may be needed every 20 to 60 minutes. Atypical opioids (eg, fentanyl, propoxyphene) or massive opioid overdoses may require much larger doses to reverse respiratory depression. In addition, to avoid precipitating acute withdrawal lower doses should be titrated incrementally in opioid-dependent patients. Continuous infusion of naloxone has also been used for respiratory depression with one suggestion of using 2\/3 of the initial effective naloxone bolus per hour with titrations to effect. INTRANASAL: Intranasal dosing is usually 2 mg (1mg\/nostril) with repeat dosing every 5 minutes if respiratory depression continues. PEDIATRIC\/PALS GUIDELINES: Pediatric dosing is initially 0.1 mg\/kg to a maximum of 2 mg and repeated every 2 to 5 minutes as needed. ALTERNATIVE DOSING: In cases of known or suspected chronic opioid therapy, a lower dose of 0.01 mg\/kg may be considered and titrated to effect to avoid withdrawal.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"}]},"13":{"id":"jycls13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Advise patient to avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination until drug effects are realized due to CNS depressant effects.<\/li><li>Inform patient to keep all units out of the reach of children to prevent accidental or deliberate ingestion.<\/li><li>Side effects may include hyperhidrosis, insomnia, constipation, nausea, vomiting, or peripheral edema.<\/li><li>Sublingual\/buccal film: Additional side effects may include oral hypoesthesia, glossodynia, or mucosal erythema.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report symptoms of withdrawal or orthostatic hypotension.<\/li><li>Counsel patient to report symptoms of hepatitis or respiratory depression.<\/li><li>Sublingual\/buccal film: Advise patient not to move film once placed in the mouth; do not cut, chew, or swallow film.<\/li><li>Warn patient against sudden discontinuation due to potential for withdrawal symptoms; dose tapering is recommended.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to limit or avoid use of concomitant alcohol or other CNS depressants.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
