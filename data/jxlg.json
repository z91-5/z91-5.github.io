PHARMACOLOGY: Crizotinib is a kinase inhibitor, including anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In ALK-positive patients with non-small cell lung cancer, this inhibition prevents the expression of oncogenic fusion proteins from activating gene expression, which subsequently impairs cell proliferation and survival of these proteins in tumors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Toxicity following overdose has not been reported.  Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses, and may include myelosuppression, pneumonitis, QTc interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, bradycardia, and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse effects include vision disturbances (ie, diplopia, photopsia, photophobia, blurred vision, visual field defect, visual impairment, vitreous floaters, visual brightness, and reduced visual acuity) (62%), nausea (53%), diarrhea (43%), vomiting (40%), edema (28%), and constipation (27%). LESS FREQUENT: Other adverse effects that have occurred less frequently include abdominal pain, stomatitis, esophageal disorders (ie, dyspepsia, dysphagia, epigastric discomfort\/pain\/burning, esophagitis, esophageal obstruction\/pain\/spasm\/ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux, odynophagia, and reflux esophagitis), dysgeusia, fatigue, chest pain, bradycardia, QT interval prolongation, elevated hepatic enzyme concentrations, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, decreased appetite, arthralgia, dizziness, neuropathy, headache, insomnia, dyspnea, cough, pneumonitis, and rash.<br\/>"},{"id":"jxlgs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CRIZOTINIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Myelosuppression has been reported with therapeutic doses. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding. Therapeutic doses of crizotinib may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of crizotinib and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients who are awake and able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain their airway or if the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect their airway, or if unstable dysrhythmias develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Severe neutropenia: filgrastim 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or SubQ or sargramostim 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV infused over 4 hours. Monitor serial CBC with differential. Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, and\/or atrial overdrive pacing.  Isoproterenol may be used if overdrive pacing is unavailable or contraindicated. Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULT: 2 g IV over 1 to 2 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILD: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs to evaluate for evidence of QT prolongation. Monitor liver enzymes after significant overdose. Monitor CBC with differential and platelets. Monitor vital signs. Obtain a chest X-ray in patients with respiratory symptoms to evaluate for evidence of pneumonitis. Serum crizotinib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (91%) and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of one or two extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance, QTc prolongation, or suspected pneumonitis should be admitted.
