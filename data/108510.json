It is also used to treat hyperammonemia in patients with valproate induced hepatotoxicity and encephalopathy. Athletes use carnitine for muscle building and endurance. PHARMACOLOGY: Levocarnitine is found in all mammalian tissue and is a carrier molecule in the transport of long-chain free fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane.  It is a trimethylated amino acid and is essential for the transformation of fatty acids into energy for muscular activity.  This transformation, which occurs in the mitochondria, produces coenzyme A.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: At the time of this review, there is no acute overdose data available. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Transient nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, body odor. Levocarnitine may cause seizures in patients with or without pre-existing seizure disorder. Headache, dizziness, and transient visual blurring have been reported in patients taking high doses of levocarnitine. A mild myasthenia has been reported following the administration of DL-carnitine to uremic patients. In clinical trials of patients on chronic hemodialysis, hypertension, tachycardia, ECG changes, anemia, and paresthesia were reported more frequently than in patients receiving placebos;  however,  the causal relationship to levocarnitine is not clear. <br\/>"},{"id":"108510-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LEVOCARNITINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose of levocarnitine. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed, if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely, and is generally only expected with chronic use.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. HOSPITAL: Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely, and is generally only expected with chronic use.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
