This agent is not intended for the prevention of malaria. PHARMACOLOGY: Each tablet contains a fixed dose combination of artemether, an artemisinin derivative, and lumefantrine, structurally similar to halofantrine, to treat uncomplicated malaria. Both agents are blood schizontocides with independent modes of action. Artemether can rapidly reduce parasitemia providing symptomatic relief, while lumefantrine can eliminate residual parasites to improve therapeutic efficacy. The combination of these agents can delay or avoid the development of resistance. TOXICOLOGY:  Limited data. In animal studies, high doses of lipid soluble artemisinin preparations have produced neurotoxicity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: At the time of this review, there is no experience with overdose. MILD TO MODERATE ORAL TOXICITY: Toxicity is likely to be an extension of adverse events, including possible QTc prolongation. SEVERE TOXICITY: No data available. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Headache, anorexia, dizziness, and asthenia are common in adults, while pyrexia, cough, vomiting, anorexia, and headache have been reported frequently in children. Most adverse events are mild and do not require discontinuation of therapy; many adverse events were likely related to the underlying malaria rather than adverse drug events. GENERAL: Other events reported in both adults and children include: malaise, arthralgias, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, and rash. QT prolongation may occur with therapy and may be more likely to occur in patients with a history of QT prolongation, receiving concomitant therapy that may prolong QT interval, or disturbances in electrolyte balance. <br\/>"},{"id":"929345-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ARTEMETHER\/LUMEFANTRINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment of artemether\/lumefantrine overdose is symptomatic and supportive. Patients may require ECG and cardiac monitoring following a significant exposure or patient's at risk (prior history of QT interval prolongation, coadministration of agents that prolong QT interval). MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination generally not necessary. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered in patients with recent, large ingestions who are alert or in whom the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Prolonged QT interval: Therapeutic doses of lumefantrine may cause prolongation of the QT interval. At the time of this review, there have been no reports of ventricular dysrhythmias. Other agents, including other antimalarials, should be used cautiously with artemether\/lumefantrine because of the potential additive effects on QT interval.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor fluid and electrolytes in cases of severe vomiting and diarrhea. Liver enzymes should be monitored in symptomatic patients. Monitor ECG for QT interval prolongation or ECG abnormalities.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to the fairly large volume of distribution and high plasma protein binding, enhanced elimination is NOT likely to be beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility.
