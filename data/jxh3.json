PHARMACOLOGY: Inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in tumor cells and endothelial cells, and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in endothelial cells. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. Vandetanib is only available through the Vandetanib Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, a restricted distribution program. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Rash, diarrhea, and hypertension were reported in patients and in healthy volunteers who received multiple doses at and above 300 mg. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity following overdose has not been reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses, and may include fatigue, severe skin rashes, hypertension, QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse effects include diarrhea (57%), rash (53%), acne (35%), nausea (33%), hypertension (33%), headache (26%), fatigue (24%), decreased appetite (21%), and abdominal pain (21%). LESS FREQUENT: Other adverse effects that have occurred less frequently include prolonged QT interval, dry skin, photosensitivity reaction, pruritus, vomiting, asthenia, insomnia, hypocalcemia, proteinuria, increased serum creatinine, increased liver enzymes, bleeding, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and depression.<br\/>"},{"id":"jxh3s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VANDETANIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: QT prolongation and torsades de pointes have been reported with therapeutic doses and may occur following overdose. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate and correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing. Hemorrhagic events have been observed. Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients who are awake and able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain their airway or if the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect their airway, or if unstable dysrhythmias develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, isoproterenol, and\/or atrial overdrive pacing.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULT: 2 g IV over 1 to 2 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILD: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes including calcium and magnesium in patients with significant overdose. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs to evaluate for evidence of QT prolongation. Monitor renal function and liver enzymes after significant overdose. Monitor CBC with differential and platelets. Monitor vital signs. Obtain a chest X-ray in patients with respiratory symptoms  to evaluate for evidence of interstitial lung disease. Serum vandetanib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (90%) and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of one or two extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance, QTc prolongation, or cardiovascular instability should be admitted.
