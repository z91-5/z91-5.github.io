Persistent supraventricular tachycardia &gt;150 beats\/minute may warrant rate control.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring, obtain an ECG, and administer oxygen.  Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders.  Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, particularly in patients with underlying impaired cardiac function.  Sotalol is an alternative.  Unstable rhythms require cardioversion.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Oxygen; may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, but pulmonary toxicity usually resolves rapidly once aldesleukin is discontinued.<\/li><li>Oliguria: Administer IV 0.9% saline judiciously (limit to 1 to 1.5 liters\/day above maintenance needs) to increase urine output.
