The excess DNA causes the already abnormal sputum to thicken. The viscous, dehydrated mucus is difficult to expectorate, obstructs airways, and contributes to reduced lung volumes and expiratory flow rates. The accumulation of purulent secretions in the airways provides a continuing growth medium for bacteria, causing chronic pulmonary infections, which are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. <\/li><li>In vitro studies have shown that DNase, an enzyme normally produced in small quantities in the pancreas and salivary glands, reduces the viscoelasticity of sputum in patients with cystic fibrosis by breaking the long extracellular DNA molecules into smaller fragments .<\/li><\/ul>"},"9":{"id":"jrl8s9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Inhalation<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Do not dilute or mix with other agents in the nebulizer.
