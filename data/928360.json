PHARMACOLOGY: Ziconotide is bound to N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels located on the primary nociceptive afferent nerves in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord. It blocks depolarization-induced increases in presynaptic intracellular calcium, which controls excitatory neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft. Ziconotide is derived from the venom of the marine snail Conus magus. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Ziconotide overdose information is limited. Exaggerated pharmacologic effects (ie, ataxia, nystagmus, dizziness, stupor, unresponsiveness, spinal myoclonus, confusion, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting) are expected to occur following ziconotide intrathecal doses greater than the maximum recommended dose of 19.2 mcg\/day. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dizziness, nausea, confusion, somnolence, nystagmus, and asthenia. Fever may be a common occurrence with intrathecal ziconotide therapy. OTHERS: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, taste perversion, cognitive impairment, agitation, stupor, headache, dizziness, asthenia, ataxia, delirium, dysarthria, tremor, hallucinations, urinary retention, hypotension, peripheral edema, atrial fibrillation, abnormal ECG, blurred vision, elevated liver enzymes, muscle spasm, pain in limb, rhabdomyolysis, sinusitis, and fever.<br\/>"},{"id":"928360-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b> ZICONOTIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Ziconotide does not bind to opiate receptors, therefore the pharmacological effects of ziconotide are NOT blocked by opioid antagonists. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. After large overdose, removal of CSF should be considered. Treat hypotension with IV fluids and pressors (norepinephrine preferred) if needed.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Following an intrathecal overdose, elimination of ziconotide from CSF will remain constant (CSF half-life: 4.6 hours); therefore, the ziconotide CSF concentration should be less than 5% of peak levels within 24 hours of ziconotide discontinuation. Immediate attempts to remove as much ziconotide as possible are recommended for very large intrathecal overdoses. Clinical experience is limited, the following information is derived from experience with intrathecal overdose from a variety of xenobiotics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain AT LEAST 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. For very large overdose, follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers).<\/li><li>Decontamination: GI decontamination is not necessary as ziconotide is administered intrathecally.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation may be necessary if life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias or significant CNS depression develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Rhabdomyolysis: Administer sufficient 0.9% saline to maintain urine output of 2 to 3 mL\/kg\/hr.  Monitor input and output, serum electrolytes, CK, and renal function. Diuretics may be necessary to maintain urine output. Urinary alkalinization is NOT routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and neurologic exam. Monitor for delirium and mental status depression. Monitor liver enzymes. Monitor CK in patients with prolonged agitation or coma. Obtain serial ECGs; institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Ziconotide is administered intrathecally. Methods to enhance systemic elimination are not indicated.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients need to be monitored for several hours. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted. Patients with significant persistent central nervous depression should be admitted to the hospital. Patients with coma, dysrhythmias, or delirium should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928360-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b> ZICONOTIDE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific minimum toxic dose of ziconotide has not been established.
