Ibritumomab tiuxetan is normally administered within several hours of rituximab; therefore, some adverse events may be related to either agent. Refer to RITUXIMAB management as needed. PHARMACOLOGY: Regions of ibritumomab bind to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in CD20+ B-cell lines in vitro. Tiuxetan (chelator) tightly binds Y-90. The chelator complex covalently links to the amino acids of exposed lysines and arginines contained within the antibody (ibritumomab). Beta emission from Y-90 induces cellular damage by the formation of free radicals in the target and neighboring cells. Ibritumomab tiuxetan does not bind selectively to neoplastic cells. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data is limited. In clinical trials, the administration of doses as high as 0.52 mCi\/kg (19.2 MBq\/kg) of Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan caused severe, prolonged hematological toxicities. When single doses up to 50 mCi (1850 MBq) and multiple doses of 20 mCi (740 MBq) followed by 40 mCi (1480 MBq) were studied in a limited number of patients, autologous stem cell support was required in some patients to manage hematological toxicity. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (10% OR GREATER): Cytopenias, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, nausea, abdominal pain, asthenia, cough, diarrhea, and fever. Myelosuppression may be prolonged and can result in grade 3\/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and possibly hemorrhage. OTHER EFFECTS: Severe cutaneous and mucocutaneous reactions (erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, bullous dermatitis and exfoliative dermatitis), vomiting, dyspnea, dizziness, arthralgia, anorexia, anxiety, ecchymosis, headache, throat irritation, back pain, flushing, peripheral edema, angioedema, extravasation injury, rash, and pruritus. Fatal infusion reactions (hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock) have also been reported, but are likely related to rituximab infusion administered in conjunction with ibritumomab. <br\/>"},{"id":"927775-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IBRITUMOMAB TIUXETAN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting.  MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) in patients who develop severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia or anemia.  In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.  Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Severe, potentially fatal infusion reactions (hypotension, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation or cardiogenic shock) have occurred, but are likely related to the rituximab infusion administered prior to ibritumomab therapy.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports of intrathecal injection with ibritumomab tiuxetan are available. This information was derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative-free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Dexamethasone: 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors if patients develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Monitor infusion site for erythema or signs of injury. Moist desquamation has been observed up to 2 weeks following exposure. Frequent dressing changes and silver sulfadiazine cream have been used. Consult plastic surgeon as indicated.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status in symptomatic patients. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelet count. In patients with neutropenia, monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, and pulmonary function tests, and obtain a chest x-ray in any patient with respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA:  Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with an overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"927775-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>IBRITUMOMAB TIUXETAN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: In clinical trials, the administration of doses as high as 0.52 mCi\/kg (19.2 MBq\/kg) of Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan caused severe hematological toxicities.
