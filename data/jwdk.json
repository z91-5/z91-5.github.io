This class includes: atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir calcium, indinavir sulfate, lopinavir\/ritonavir, nelfinavir mesylate, ritonavir, saquinavir mesylate, and tipranavir. PHARMACOLOGY: Protease inhibitors reversibly bind the HIV-1 protease necessary for protein cleavage and subsequent enzyme (reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase) activation leading to inhibition of infectivity. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicological effects are generally an extension of adverse effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon and severe sequelae from acute overdose are rare. However, adverse effects and drug interactions are common. OVERDOSE: There are limited overdose data, despite more than 15 years of availability. In general, overdose effects seem to be well tolerated. The following effects have been reported: INDINAVIR: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hematuria, crystalluria, renal insufficiency, and nephrolithiasis. RITONAVIR: vomiting, headache, and rash. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, and elevated liver enzymes are common. SEVERE: Severe effects include pancreatitis, liver failure, myelosuppression, heart block, and lactic acidosis. Other adverse effects specific to each drug include: ATAZANAVIR: hyperglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia (5%), nephrolithiasis, rash, nausea, vomiting, transaminitis, neutropenia (4%), hepatitis. DARUNAVIR: nausea, vomiting, lipodystrophy, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare), hepatic failure (rare). FOSAMPRENAVIR: Transaminitis, hepatotoxicity (6%). INDINAVIR: Transaminitis, rash, nephrolithiasis (5%), hepatic steatosis (3%), lipodystrophy, and rarely, vasculitis, lactic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. LOPINAVIR\/RITONAVIR: hepatotoxicity, rash, hypercholesterolemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. NELFINAVIR: transaminitis, hepatotoxicity (5%). RITONAVIR: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, paresthesias, hypercholesterolemia, hepatotoxicity, and rash, all of which are largely dose-dependent. SAQUINAVIR: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common. TIPRANAVIR: Transaminitis, hepatotoxicity (10%), rash, nausea, vomiting. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Drug interactions are common with this class of medications; most are mediated by Cytochrome P450 3A4. Drugs that are 3A4 inhibitors will decrease the metabolism of most protease inhibitors and increase toxicity. Administration of most protease inhibitors with drugs that are 3A4 substrates decreases metabolism and increases toxicity of these other drugs. Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, and darunavir are all P450 3A4 substrates and inhibitors. Tipranavir, lopinavir\/ritonavir, and indinavir are P450 3A4 substrates only.<br\/>"},{"id":"jwdks12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AIDS ANTIVIRAL PROTEASE INHIBITORS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Supportive care remains the mainstay of care. Mild transaminitis can be monitored; discontinuation of therapy is usually not necessary. Therapy should be changed for persistently rising transaminases or evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Nausea and vomiting should be treated with antiemetics. Peripheral neuropathies are generally reversible with drug withdrawal and can be treated with pain management as needed. Mild elevations in lactic acid do not require discontinuation of therapy unless systemic acidemia ensues. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care remains the mainstay of care in severe toxicity. Withdrawal of the offending agent is imperative to improvement in severe adverse reactions. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome should be treated with supportive care and consideration of corticosteroid and IV immunoglobulin therapy. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) should be considered for neutropenia complicated by infection felt to be secondary to protease inhibitors. Hepatic failure should prompt consultation with a transplant center.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: No prehospital decontamination is indicated. Prehospital care should focus on assessment of vital signs and general supportive care. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered for patients who present early after overdose if they are awake and willing to drink the charcoal. Gastric lavage is not indicated as overdose is not life-threatening.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient:  Obtain a basic metabolic panel, and monitor CBC and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients.

Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent ingestion of a protease inhibitor can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours, primarily monitoring signs of co-ingestant toxicity. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe toxicity should be admitted. Patients with hepatic failure or severe acidosis should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Infectious disease should be consulted if a change to anti-retroviral therapy is indicated.
