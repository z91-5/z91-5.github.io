Benzoyl peroxide is used in industry as an oxidizing agent, a polymerization initiator, a catalyst, and a curing agent. Benzoyl peroxide is utilized as a source of free radicals in organic synthesis, and is used in dental resin cement, for automobile body putty, in roof bolting, and in the mining industry. PHARMACOLOGY: Benzoyl peroxide has antimicrobial activity. TOXICOLOGY: Benzoyl peroxide is irritating to skin and mucous membranes. Allergic dermatitis may occur. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare and clinically significant toxicity has not been reported. OVERDOSE: No overdoses resulting in significant toxicity have been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Contact dermatitis, xeroderma, erythema, and skin peeling.<br\/><\/li><li><b>LINCOMYCIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Lincomycin and clindamycin are antibiotic agents approved for treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Clindamycin is also used topically to treat acne vulgaris and bacterial vaginosis. PHARMACOLOGY: Clindamycin and lincomycin bind exclusively to the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit and suppress bacterial protein synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose from lincomycin and clindamycin is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. A 12 gram bolus intravenous lincomycin dose produced cardiac arrest immediately following intubation. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Diarrhea has been reported following the administration of lincomycin and clindamycin. Pseudomembranous colitis is a widely reported adverse effect of lincomycin and clindamycin therapy when administered orally and\/or parenterally. It may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. OTHER EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, stomatitis, esophagitis, glossitis, tinnitus, vertigo, and dermatitis. RARE: Steven's-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, acute allergic reactions, sideroblastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, and nephrotoxicity (eg, azotemia, oliguria, and proteinuria). Rapid administration of large doses has resulted in ventricular dysrhythmias, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jukhs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>BENZOYL PEROXIDE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Significant toxicity is not expected after benzoyl peroxide overdose. INHALATION EXPOSURE: Move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta-2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area extremely thoroughly with soap and water. A physician may need to examine the area if irritation or pain persists after washing. EYE EXPOSURE: Irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia persist, the patient should be seen in a health care facility.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA; Patients with severe skin symptoms and non-skin symptoms, and patients with deliberate overdoses should be referred to a health care facility for observation and treatment. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients are not expected to develop toxicity requiring admission. CONSULT CRITERIA:  Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>LINCOMYCIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Acute toxicity, other than gastrointestinal discomfort, is not common. Rapid administration of large doses has resulted in hypotension. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The primary toxic effects involve the gastrointestinal tract and may include severe diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis.  Metronidazole for mild to moderate disease and vancomycin for severe disease are recommended in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required. <\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally NOT necessary. HOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is not expected after an overdose. Gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely warranted. Consider activated charcoal after extremely large ingestions or those involving toxic co-ingestants.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be needed following an overdose; however, ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor vital signs, CBC with differential with platelet count, renal function, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with significant overdose. Monitor for clinical evidence of colitis. Evaluate for C, difficile toxin if colitis develops.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: In several studies, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were not effective in reducing lincomycin or clindamycin levels significantly.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patient with inadvertent ingestions who have minimal symptoms can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a health care facility and monitored until symptoms resolve.

ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted.
