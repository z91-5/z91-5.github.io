Following infection with mycobacteria, sensitization of T-cells  occurs primarily in the regional lymph nodes. Natural infection with M. tuberculosis usually initiates a cell-mediated immune response against mycobacterial antigens. T-cells proliferate in response to the infection and give rise to T-cells specifically sensitized to mycobacterial antigens. After several weeks, these T-lymphocytes enter the bloodstream and circulate for a long period of time. Subsequent restimulation of these T-lymphocytes with intradermal injection of tuberculin PPD evokes a local reaction mediated by these cells.<br\/>"},"9":{"id":"633620-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>intradermal is the preferred route; do not give IV, IM, or subQ<br\/><\/li><li><b>Intradermal<\/b><br\/><ul><li>do not dilute solution<\/li><li>inject intradermally, using a tuberculin syringe with a 26 or 27 gauge needle, into the epidermal (most superficial) layers of the skin on the flexor (volar) surface of the forearm<\/li><li>insert needle with bevel pointing upward; a 6 mm to 10 mm pale bleb will rise at the needle point and disappear within minutes; if a bleb does not form, immediately repeat the injection at least 2 inches from the original injection site<\/li><li>no dressing is required<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"633620-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>skin reaction; interpret 48 to 72 hours after injection: results based only on palpable induration measured in mm transversely to the long axis<\/li><li>skin reaction; a positive hypersensitivity reaction to the tuberculin skin test may not be seen until 2 to 10 weeks after the infection<\/li><li>induration of 5 mm or greater is positive in recently-exposed individuals, persons with HIV infection or risk factors for HIV, organ transplant patients, and persons with a fibrotic chest x-ray consistent with healed TB<\/li><li>induration of 10 mm or greater is positive in all persons who belong to a high-risk or high-prevalance group for TB<\/li><li>induration of 15 mm or greater is positive in persons without any risk factors<\/li><li>HIV-infected patients who test negative and belong to high-risk populations; perform annual repeated testing<\/li><li>health-care workers: two-step method is recommended at the time of initial testing; if the first test result is negative, the second step of the two-step baseline testing should be repeated in 1 to 3 wk; if the second test result is positive, consider patient has latent TB infection, if the second result is negative, the health care worker is classified as uninfected; recent conversion in health care workers is defined as a positive hypersensitivity reaction greater than or equal to 10 mm increase within a 2 yr period or an increase of a 15 mm within a 2 yr (if facility unlikely to have TB exposure).<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"633620-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Aplisol<\/b><br\/>Intradermal Solution: 5 TU\/0.1 ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Tubersol<\/b><br\/>Intradermal Solution: 5 TU\/0.1 ML<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"633620-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"Instruct patient to visit healthcare professional 48 to 72 h after injection for interpretation of skin reaction.<br\/>"}}}
