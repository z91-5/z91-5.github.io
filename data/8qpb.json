It is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess. Nitrofurantoin is also available as nitrofurantoin macrocrystals and nitrofurantoin monohydrate\/nitrofurantoin, macrocrystals. PHARMACOLOGY: Nitrofurantoin is bactericidal at therapeutic doses. Through its reactive intermediates, it inactivates bacterial ribosomal proteins and other large molecules resulting in inhibition of vital biochemical processes such as protein synthesis, aerobic energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell wall synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: There are very little data available on toxicity of nitrofurantoin after an overdose. Acute overdose has resulted in only vomiting. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache. OTHER EFFECTS: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia. PULMONARY HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION: Acute, subacute or chronic pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions have rarely occurred; fatalities have been reported. Pulmonary toxicity may include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or both. Patients receiving long-term treatment for 6 months or longer are at increased risk of developing chronic pulmonary reactions. Acute pulmonary reactions usually occur within the first week of treatment, and can be manifested by eosinophilia, fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, or pulmonary infiltration with consolidation or pleural effusion on x-ray. Eosinophilia and fever occur less frequently in subacute pulmonary reactions than in the acute form. Recovery may vary from dramatic resolution to several months. Patients with pulmonary reactions have also developed ECG changes (eg, non-specific ST\/T wave changes, bundle branch block). RARE: Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, maculopapular or macular rashes, fixed drug reactions, erythema nodosum, angioedema, bullous eruptions, immune hypersensitivity reactions, nystagmus, papilledema, elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic hepatitis, peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, hemolytic anemia (linked to G6PD deficiency), megaloblastic anemia, agranulocytosis, methemoglobinemia, Lyell's syndrome, and SLE syndromes. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred following nitrofurantoin therapy. Some cases may become severe, irreversible, or fatal. Renal impairment, anemia, diabetes mellitus, electrolyte imbalance, vitamin B deficiency, or debilitating disease may increase the risk for peripheral neuropathy. <br\/>"},{"id":"8qpbs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>NITROFURANTOIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Significant toxicity is not expected after an acute nitrofurantoin overdose. The most serious chronic effects involve the pulmonary and hematologic systems, as well as various peripheral neuropathies.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely required. HOSPITAL:  Significant toxicity is not expected after a acute nitrofurantoin overdose. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. Consider activated charcoal only if coingestants with significant toxicity are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine laboratory studies are not necessary after overdose unless otherwise clinically indicated. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, and pulmonary function tests, and obtain a chest x-ray in any patient with respiratory symptoms. Monitor CBC with differential with platelet count, renal function, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients with suspected toxicity from chronic use.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Severe toxicity has never been reported; enhanced elimination is not necessary.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe acute pulmonary reactions. Patients should also be admitted for severe vomiting, diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"8qpbs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b> NITROFURANTOIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established.
