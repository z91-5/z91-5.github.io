PHARMACOLOGY: Procarbazine hydrochloride, a hydrazine derivative antineoplastic agent, is thought to exert its cytotoxic action by inhibiting the transmethylation of methyl groups of methionine into t-RNA, which also results in cessation of protein, RNA and DNA synthesis. It may also cause direct damage to DNA. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Nausea, vomiting, enteritis, diarrhea, hypotension, tremors, seizures, and coma may occur following procarbazine overdose. Prolonged thrombocytopenia developed in one patient following procarbazine overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: CNS stimulation (eg, confusion, seizures, and hallucinations), myelosuppression (eg, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia), GI effects (nausea and vomiting) have been frequently reported following therapeutic use.  Myelosuppression is a dose-limiting effect of therapy. Symptoms of immunosuppression may be delayed up to 2 to 8 weeks postingestion. Other reported effects are diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, pruritus, hyperpigmentation, flushing, alopecia, jaundice, hepatoxicity, acute allergic reaction, paresthesias, neuropathies, interstitial pneumonitis, dizziness, nystagmus, diplopia, papilledema, photophobia and retinal hemorrhage, headache, insomnia, frequent nightmares, nervousness, depression, psychosis, coma, tremors, and hypertensive crisis. Since procarbazine is a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor, adverse effects of procarbazine are similar to those of MAO inhibition with the exception of hematologic, pulmonary and gastrointestinal effects that may occur with therapy. Disulfiram-like reactions may occur with hypertensive crisis ingestion of procarbazine and ethanol. A hypertensive reaction may occur with concurrent use of sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and foods with high tyramine content. <br\/>"},{"id":"484304-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PROCARBAZINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Myelosuppression has been reported. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg, filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression or persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression, respiratory failure, severe bleeding, or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors if patients develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension does not usually require treatment. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside or phentolamine are preferred, with nitroglycerin or labetalol as alternatives.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Administer oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. In patients with a procarbazine overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: Control agitation with benzodiazepines, control rigidity (may require neuromuscular blockade), and evaporative cooling.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs, mental status, and hepatic enzymes in patients with significant exposure. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with prolonged vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Delayed bone marrow toxicity may occur 4 to 8 weeks postingestion. Monitor serial CBC with differential, including platelets, for several weeks following an overdose. In patients with neutropenia, monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor pulse oximetry and\/or arterial blood gases in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestion of one extra dose can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than one extra dose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours) and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. Patients demonstrating severe electrolyte imbalance, severe bleeding, or severe respiratory distress should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"484304-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PROCARBAZINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Insufficient information exists to establish a minimum toxic or lethal dose.
