Ado-trastuzumab emtansine should NOT be substituted for trastuzumab. PHARMACOLOGY: This agent is composed of an antibody component derived from humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, trastuzumab, and a small molecule cytotoxin, DM1, a microtubule inhibitor. Upon binding to sub-domain IV of the HER2 receptor, ado-trastuzumab emtansine undergoes receptor mediated internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation, resulting in intracellular release of DM1-containing cytotoxic catabolites. The binding of DMl to tubulin disrupts microtubule networks in the cell causing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. TOXICOLOGY: Theoretically, in overdose the loss of selectivity as a microtubule inhibitor could cause toxicity, especially myelosuppression and GI toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Limited data. Overdose is uncommon. Signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are anticipated to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, muscle pain and headache may develop following overdose. Other adverse events may include thrombocytopenia and increased transaminases. SEVERE TOXICITY: Cardiotoxicity (ie, left ventricular cardiac dysfunction), hepatotoxicity, and thrombocytopenia (Grade 3 and 4) may develop following a significant exposure. Neurotoxicity may include Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy. Pulmonary toxicity (interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis) and serious or fatal infusion reactions may occur. ADVERSE EVENTS: SUMMARY:  Fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopenia, headache, increased transaminases, and constipation are the most common adverse reactions reported with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Fever and chills are common during an infusion. CARDIOVASCULAR: Patients can be at risk to develop left ventricular dysfunction. Hypertension may also occur. HEMATOLOGIC: Thrombocytopenia is likely to occur. Anemia and neutropenia have also occurred with some frequency in patients treated with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. RESPIRATORY: Epistaxis, cough, and dyspnea have occurred frequently (greater than 10%) with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Infrequent cases of interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis (some cases have lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome or fatal outcome) have been observed. RARE: Infusion reactions and extravasation injuries have developed infrequently with ado-trastuzumab emtansine administration. <br\/>"},{"id":"930478-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ADO-TRASTUZUMAB EMTANSINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes and IV fluids as needed. Treat significant diarrhea with antidiarrheal agents. Obtain a CBC and monitor for thrombocytopenia; during therapeutic use patients reached nadir by day 8. Monitor respiratory function (dyspnea, cough or epistaxis). Monitor liver enzymes (ie, transaminases). MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Cardiac dysfunction (left ventricular dysfunction), neurotoxicity (peripheral neurotoxicity) and myelosuppression (ie, thrombocytopenia) are likely the most significant toxicity that can occur with ado-trastuzumab emtansine therapy. A decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction can occur. Obtain an echocardiogram to assess left ventricular ejection fraction. Monitor for myelosuppression.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary as ado-trastuzumab emtansine is administered intravenously. For dermal exposures, clean skin with soap and water, and for eye exposures, flush with water.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect airway or if unstable due to cardiac toxicity, an infusion reaction, severe respiratory distress syndrome, or CNS depression.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Intrathecal injection has not been reported with ado-trastuzumab emtansine, but this agent has caused neurotoxicity following IV infusion. Severe neurotoxicity may develop with an inadvertent intrathecal infusion. Based on other agents the following therapy is suggested. After an overdose, keep the patient upright and immediately drain at least 20 mL of CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free saline). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 24 hours). Add fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP to 1 L NS or LR) or 5% albumin to the perfusate to enhance removal as ado-trastuzumab emtansine is highly protein bound. Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Anaphylaxis: MILD: Antihistamines; SEVERE: Airway management, epinephrine, cardiac monitoring and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Monitor serial CBCs for thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and\/or anemia which have been reported with ado-trastuzumab emtansine therapy; most cases were mild. Consider further therapy as indicated. Administer colony stimulating factors if severe neutropenia develops. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, olanzapine).<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Reactions have been mild with therapeutic use and usually occur within 24 hours of an infusion. If extravasation occurs, withdraw as much solution as possible from the catheter before it is removed. Monitor site.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and neuro status. Monitor serum electrolytes, serial CBC and liver enzymes following exposure. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. Obtain a chest radiograph and monitor pulse oximetry and\/or arterial blood gases in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms or evidence of dyspnea or pneumonitis. Obtain an echocardiogram following a significant exposure to assess left ventricular ejection fraction.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful given the increased protein binding (93%) of ado-trastuzumab emtansine.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), cardiac monitoring, and daily monitoring of CBC. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with an overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930478-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ADO-TRASTUZUMAB EMTANSINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A lethal human dose has not been established.
