It is also used concomitantly with adrenal corticosteroids; in kidney and heart transplant, and used in conjunction with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. It was previously known as FK506. PHARMACOLOGY: Tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation, however, the exact mechanism is unknown. It has been suggested that tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. This complex along with calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. This effect can prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells which results in the inhibition of T-lymphocyte activation (ie, immunosuppression). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Limited information. Overdose has been infrequently reported. OVERDOSE: TACROLIMUS: Acute overdoses of up to 30 times the therapeutic dose have occurred and almost all cases have been asymptomatic and recovered without sequelae. In patients who have received inadvertent overdoses of tacrolimus, the effects have been similar to those reported at therapeutic dose. SIROLIMUS: Limited data; events are anticipated to be similar to adverse events reported with tacrolimus. TEMSIROLIMUS: Doses greater than 25 mg may result in serious events including: thrombosis, bowel perforation, interstitial lung disease, seizures and psychosis. ADVERSE EVENTS: TACROLIMUS: COMMON: Adverse events occurring in up to 40% of patients following kidney, liver or heart transplant include: tremor, hypertension, abnormal renal function, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, insomnia, fever, asthenia, paraesthesia, anemia, leukopenia, peripheral edema, asthenia, pain, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, infection, CMV infection, urinary tract infection, bronchitis, and pericardial effusion. OTHER: CNS effects are the most common events reported. The most severe events include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), delirium and coma. Symptoms that may develop with PRES can include headache, altered mental status, seizures, visual disturbances, and hypertension. Usually these events will resolve with symptomatic care (ie, antihypertensives) and discontinuation of therapy. Coma and delirium, in the absence of PRES, appear to be dose dependent. NEPHROTOXICITY (acute or chronic) can develop in high doses. It is usually characterized by an increase in serum creatinine, changes to the kidney graft life and histologic changes on renal biopsy. Events are typically progressive. HEMATOLOGIC effects have included anemia, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. LYMPHOMA and other malignancies can develop as a result of immunosuppressive therapy. INFECTION: Patients are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections with therapy. INFREQUENT: Hemolytic uremic syndrome, pneumonitis. IMMUNOLOGIC: Anaphylaxis has been reported with the intravenous formulations; frequency not known. SIROLIMUS and TEMSIROLIMUS: These agents have similar adverse events to tacrolimus. <br\/>"},{"id":"929332-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>TACROLIMUS AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor vital signs and neurologic status. Monitor fluid status and electrolytes following significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Administer oral or IV fluids and replace electrolytes as needed. Antidiarrheals may be indicated following persistent symptoms. Seizure activity may develop; treat with IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates. Mild hypertension usually does not require treatment. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Nitroprusside or nitroglycerin may be considered for significant or persistent hypertension. Monitor CBC with differential and monitor for signs of serious infection (eg, bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal). Begin anti-infective treatment as soon as possible. Patients may also be at risk to develop anemia and thrombocytopenia. Transfuse packed red blood cells and platelets as indicated. Obtain a baseline ECG in patients (ie, preexisting congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, antiarrhythmic medications) at risk to develop QT prolongation or as indicated.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated because CNS effects can develop and may include seizures. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered following a recent ingestion, if the patient is not vomiting and the airway is supported.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary following a mild to moderate exposure. Ensure adequate ventilation and intubation as necessary in patients that develop seizure activity or significant CNS depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (including blood pressure) and neurologic status. Monitor fluid status in patients that develop significant gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, vomiting, diarrhea). Obtain serial CBC with differential and electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, glucose) following a significant exposure. Monitor renal function closely including serum creatinine, potassium, and urine output for signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity. Monitor liver enzymes after a significant overdose. Obtain a baseline ECG, continuous cardiac monitoring and serial ECGs following a significant exposure or as indicated. Patients receiving these agents are at increased risk for serious infections including bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal infections including opportunistic infections with therapeutic use. Obtain laboratory studies to determine the presence of infection and monitor for symptoms (ie, fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, etc) as indicated.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Based on high protein binding of the agents, hemodialysis is not anticipated to be effective following overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic adult with an inadvertent ingestion of 1 extra dose can be monitored at home. An asymptomatic child that ingests 1 dose can be monitored at home if reliable adult supervision is present. If the amount ingested is unknown the child should be observed in a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion or inadvertent ingestion of more than 2 extra doses should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with an unintentional ingestion of more than 1 dose or an unknown amount should be observed in a healthcare facility until any symptoms resolve and adequate follow-up can be provided as needed. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be admitted. Patients with persistent mental status changes and seizures should be admitted to an ICU setting.

Clinical events that did develop (ie, tremors, abnormal renal function, hypertension, and peripheral edema) were similar to effects reported with therapy. PEDIATRIC: Ingestions of 0.88 and 1 mg\/kg of tacrolimus have been well tolerated in children. ADULT: Acute overdoses of up to 375 mg and 120 mg of TACROLIMUS and SIROLIMUS, respectively, have been well tolerated in adults. An adult with a cadaveric renal transplant developed transiently elevated serum creatinine after ingesting 90 mg of tacrolimus but recovered with supportive care. A sirolimus overdose of 150 mg, in an adult, resulted in transient atrial fibrillation. TEMSIROLIMUS: In clinical trials with cancer patients, repeated intravenous doses as high as 220 mg\/m(2) have been given. Doses of greater than 25 mg may increase the risk of developing: thrombosis, bowel perforation, interstitial lung disease, seizures and psychosis. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: TACROLIMUS: ADULT: The recommended starting dose is 0.1 to 0.2 mg\/kg\/day orally for kidney transplant patients; 0.1 to 0.15 mg\/kg\/day orally for liver transplant patients and 0.075 mg\/kg\/day orally for heart transplant patients. SIROLIMUS: For de novo renal transplant recipients a loading dose of 6 mg, and a daily maintenance dose of 2 mg is recommended.
