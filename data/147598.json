It is also used as a prophylactic agent indicated in treatment of patients with bronchial asthma. Nedocromil sodium ophthalmic solution is indicated for the treatment of pruritus associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Nedocromil sodium inhaler has been used as maintenance therapy for the management of mild to moderate asthma. PHARMACOLOGY: Cromolyn sodium, an antiinflammatory agent and mast cell stabilizer, prevents bronchoconstriction that manifests early or late in response to an inhaled antigen. It blocks the release of histamine and SRS-A (slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis) from sensitized mast cells and does not exert any intrinsic vasoconstrictor and glucocorticoid effects. Nedocromil sodium is an antiinflammatory agent that blocks the release of mediators of hypersensitivity reactions from mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes and platelets. The drug inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells and beta-glucuronidase from macrophages in bronchoalveolar cells. It does not exert any bronchodilating, antihistaminic, or corticosteroid effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare and serious toxicity has not been reported. OVERDOSE: These agents are poorly absorbed and are low in toxicity. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses.  ADVERSE EFFECTS: CROMOLYN: The following adverse effects have been reported: ORAL SOLUTION:  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, glossitis, stomatitis, dysphagia, esophagospasm, pruritus, rash, erythema\/burning, photosensitivity, urticaria, angioedema, eosinophilia. OPHTHALMIC: Stinging and burning of eyes, allergic reactions (eg, swelling, intense redness, and itching of the eyes), rhinoconjunctivitis, and myositis. NASAL: Nasal congestion, sneezing, nasal itching, nosebleed, nose burning, rhinoconjunctivitis, and headache. INHALATION: Nasal congestion, throat irritation and hoarseness, esophagitis, laryngeal and pharyngeal edema and irritation, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, bronchial irritation, pulmonary infiltrates, cough, and wheezing. Acute, life-threatening reactions (eg, anaphylactoid reaction) have been allergic, rather than toxic, in nature. NEDOCROMIL: OPHTHALMIC: MOST COMMON: Headache. OTHER EFFECTS: Ocular burning and irritation, taste disturbances, and nasal congestion, conjunctivitis, redness, photophobia. INHALATION: Nedocromil appears to be well-tolerated. MOST COMMON: Taste disturbance. INFREQUENT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and coughing. <br\/>"},{"id":"147598-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CROMOLYN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after an overdose of cromolyn or nedocromil.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  These agents are poorly absorbed and are low in toxicity.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended. HOSPITAL: These agents are poorly absorbed orally and are low in toxicity.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is rarely necessary.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"147598-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b> CROMOLYN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
