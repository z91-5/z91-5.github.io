Used for the treatment and prevention of iron-deficiency anemia. PHARMACOLOGY: Iron is required in the function of multiple essential protein and enzyme complexes including hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochromes. TOXICOLOGY: Iron is a general cellular poison and is directly corrosive to the GI mucosa. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Historically, a common poisoning which was one of the leading causes of pediatric toxicologic deaths. Exposure has been reduced in recent years with improved packaging, but still has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Vomiting and diarrhea may occur within 6 hours of ingestion. SEVERE POISONING: Severe vomiting and diarrhea, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, shock, GI hemorrhage, coma, seizures, hepatotoxicity, and late onset GI strictures. PHASE I (0.5 to 2 hours) includes vomiting, hematemesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, lethargy, shock, acidosis, and coagulopathy. Necrosis to the GI tract occurs from the direct effect of iron on GI mucosa. Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhagic necrosis with large losses of fluid and blood contribute to shock. PHASE II includes apparent recovery; continue to observe patient closely. PHASE III (2 to 12 hours after phase I) includes profound shock, severe acidosis, cyanosis, and fever. Increased total peripheral resistance, decreased plasma volume, hemoconcentration, decrease in total blood volume, hypotension, CNS depression, and metabolic acidosis have been demonstrated. PHASE IV (2 to 4 days) includes possible hepatotoxicity. Thought to be a direct action of iron on mitochondria. Monitor liver function tests and bilirubin. Acute lung injury may also occur. Phase V (days to weeks) includes GI scarring and strictures. GI obstruction secondary to gastric or pyloric scarring may occur due to corrosive effects of iron. Sustained-release preparations have resulted in small intestinal necrosis with resultant scarring and obstruction. Carbonyl iron (also referred to as \"iron carbonyl\") appears to be less toxic than other iron formulations because of limited absorption. Please refer to the CARBONYL IRON management for further information. Case reports suggest that iron-dextran complex overdoses may be associated with high serum iron concentrations without evidence of a corresponding degree of clinical symptoms and signs of toxicity. Please refer to the IRON DEXTRAN management for further information. ADVERSE EFFECTS: GI upset, constipation. <br\/>"},{"id":"931341-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IRON <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Supportive care with intravenous fluid hydration is usually sufficient for mild poisonings. Activated charcoal is not effective for iron ingestions. Patients who are symptomatic should be observed for clinical deterioration and development of acidosis. Abdominal x-rays should be obtained as tablets are generally radiopaque. When large amounts of tablets are visible on radiograph, consider whole bowel irrigation. An iron concentration should be measured 4 to 6 hours after the initial ingestion and then repeated in 2 to 4 hours. Patients who develop metabolic acidosis or are clinically worsening with IV hydration should be treated with chelation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Chelation with deferoxamine is needed for patients with signs of severe poisoning including shock, acidosis, GI hemorrhage, and lethargy or coma. Consider chelation for serum iron concentrations greater than 500 mcg\/dL (a patient will usually have significant signs and symptoms of toxicity). Patients may need blood transfusions if they have significant GI hemorrhage.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not useful. Most patients have spontaneous vomiting. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal does not adequately bind iron and is not useful. Studies have suggested that magnesium hydroxide antacids (5 mg magnesium hydroxide per gram of elemental iron ingested) decrease serum iron concentrations following a simulated overdose. Gastric lavage may be useful soon after ingestion in adults, but the nasogastric tubes used in children are not sufficiently large to remove tablets. In patients with large amounts of radiopaque tablets in the GI tract, whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol should be considered. Endoscopic removal is another option for patients with a large number of tablets in the stomach.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who are comatose or with altered mental status may need mechanical respiratory support and orotracheal intubation.<\/li><li>Antidote: DEFEROXAMINE can be used to chelate iron and should be used when there are signs of severe poisoning including shock, acidosis, GI hemorrhage, and coma. Deferoxamine is administered intravenously at a rate of 15 mg\/kg\/hour; it can be titrated up to a rate of 40 mg\/kg\/hour for patients with severe poisoning. However, hypotension may occur with high dose deferoxamine infusion and the rate should be slowed if this occurs. Deferoxamine should be continued for 12 to 24 hours and then titrated off if the patient is clinically improving. If the patient worsens as the deferoxamine is titrated off, it should be restarted. Prolonged (greater than 24 hours) high dose infusion of deferoxamine has been associated with acute lung injury and should be avoided. Patients receiving deferoxamine chelation are at increased risk for Yersinia enterocolitica sepsis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Serial serum iron levels are indicated. Obtain a complete metabolic panel and complete blood count. Baseline arterial or venous blood gas in patients with severe toxicity. Obtain an abdominal radiograph to evaluate for retained tablets.<\/li><li>Seizure: IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not effective in removing iron, but may be necessary to remove deferoxamine-iron complexes in patients with renal insufficiency. Consider exchange transfusion in those patients with a serum iron exceeding 1000 mcg\/dL who clinically deteriorate despite supportive care and intravenous chelation therapy.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Inadvertent ingestions of less than 40 mg\/kg of elemental iron in patients who have only mild GI symptoms (self limited vomiting or diarrhea) can be watched at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with more than mild symptoms, those who have ingested 40 mg\/kg or more, or patients with intentional ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have hypotension, severe or worsening metabolic acidosis, GI hemorrhage, altered mental status, or a patient that requires chelation should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing severe poisonings and for recommendations on determining the need for chelation or whole bowel irrigation. Consult a gastroenterologist for endoscopic removal if many tablets persist in the stomach.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931341-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>IRON<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Ingestion of less than 40 mg\/kg generally does not cause significant toxicity, although mild GI irritation may develop. Mild symptoms are likely to occur with peak iron concentrations greater than 300 mcg\/dL, while peak concentrations of more than 500 mcg\/dL generally causes severe symptoms. If the patient presents after peak concentrations have occurred, severe toxicity may be associated with lower iron concentrations. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Daily doses for children with severe iron deficiency are generally 4 to 6 mg\/kg\/day. Normal serum iron levels generally range from 65 to 175 mcg\/dL.
