Intravenous lipid emulsions are used to reverse severe toxicity secondary to lipid-soluble drugs or chemicals, such as local anesthetics, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants. PHARMACOLOGY: Intravenous fat emulsion provides a source of energy and essential fatty acids when used in TPN. Its mechanism of action in reversing toxicity of lipid soluble drugs is not clearly understood, but it is thought to modulate intracellular metabolism by providing an energy source for the heart. It is also thought to act as a lipid sink, causing redistribution of lipid-soluble drugs away from target tissues, and to activate calcium ion channels, thereby increasing intracellular myocardial calcium. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Intralipid is a very rare cause of poisoning and rarely results in severe manifestations. OVERDOSE: Supratherapeutic doses of intralipid may result in a fat overload syndrome characterized by hyperlipidemia, fever, fatty infiltration, hepatomegaly, jaundice, splenomegaly, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disturbance (increased clotting time), seizure, and coma.  ADVERSE EFFECTS: ACUTE: COMMON: Dyspnea, cyanosis, allergic reactions, hyperlipemia, hypercoagulability, nausea, vomiting, headache, flushing, increase in temperature, sweating, and sleepiness. LESS COMMON: Pain in the chest and back, slight pressure over the eyes, dizziness, pancreatitis, and irritation at the site of infusion. CHRONIC: Long-term use of intravenous fat emulsion for parenteral nutrition can result in hepatic steatosis, cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. Intravenous fat emulsion solutions contain aluminum and may lead to toxic accumulation in the bone and CNS after prolonged use. <br\/>"},{"id":"4sqws12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>INTRAVENOUS LIPID EMULSION THERAPY FOR OVERDOSE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate toxicity can be treated with cessation of intralipid therapy.

Patients on long term parental therapy may need serial labs and a longer period of observation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: The vast majority of patients receiving intralipid are already admitted.

She had no obvious clinical toxicity from the intravenous lipid overdose except for lipemic serum, but died 3 days after presentation from the amlodipine overdose. Death has been reported in preterm infants due to IV fat accumulation in the lungs. When used as total parenteral nutrition, infusion rates should not exceed 1 g\/kg in 4 hours. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: TPN: ADULT: The recommended dose for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) dosing is 0.1 gram fat\/minute for the first 15 to 30 minutes, and may be increased to 0.2 g fat\/minute if no adverse reactions occur. MAXIMUM DOSE:  2.5 g of fat\/kg\/day. Infusion rates should not exceed 1 g\/kg in 4 hours.
