These drugs include tamoxifen, toremifene, and raloxifene. Clomiphene is covered under a separate management. PHARMACOLOGY: These compounds work on the estrogen receptors with effects ranging from full agonists, to mixed agonists\/antagonists (agonistic in some tissues while antagonistic in others) to pure antagonists to all estrogen receptors. For example, tamoxifen acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in the breast, but as an agonist in the uterus. In contrast, raloxifene behaves as an antagonist in both tissues. TOXICOLOGY: Toxic effects are secondary to their effects on estrogen receptors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdoses of these compounds are extremely rare; however, as they are widely used, adverse effects are common. OVERDOSE: There is very little information regarding overdose of these compounds in humans. TAMOXIFEN: At doses 6 times (400 mg\/m(2) the recommended doses (20 to 40 mg daily), neurotoxicity (seizures, tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness) and ECG changes (prolonged QT interval) were noted. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most commonly reported adverse effects at recommended doses include hot flashes, nausea, and vomiting. Though infrequent, thromboembolism can occur and may be life-threatening. Other reported effects include liver damage, usually following chronic use, hypercalcemia and local disease flare with associated bone and tumor pain. There have been reports of fetal harm and toxicity with drugs from this class. Other potential side effects include ocular lesions, QT prolongation, neurologic effects (tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, dizziness) depression and gynecologic malignancies (uterine and endometrial cancers). <br\/>"},{"id":"924404-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SELECTIVE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate overdoses can be treated symptomatically (eg, antiemetics for nausea and vomiting). MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity should be treated symptomatically. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol as needed. Torsades de pointes can be treated with boluses of magnesium and overdrive pacing and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. If patients develop a thromboembolic event such as pulmonary embolism treat with standard respiratory support and anticoagulation as indicated.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is not recommended because of the risk of seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal if recent, substantial ingestion, and patient able to protect airway and cooperative. There is no evidence for multiple doses of activated charcoal or whole bowel irrigation.<\/li><li>Antidote: No specific antidote exists for this overdose.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion.  Treat stable patients with magnesium and\/or atrial overdrive pacing.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE: DOSE: ADULT:  2 g IV over 1 to 2 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr, if dysrhythmias recur. CHILD: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, aprindine) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes and liver enzymes after significant overdose. Specific drug levels are not readily available or particularly useful. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no evidence for the use of dialysis, hemoperfusion, urinary alkalinization or multiple dose charcoal. Hemodialysis is unlikely to benefit patients as these class of drugs tend to be highly protein bound.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic with small inadvertent exposures can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions or inadvertent ingestions of more than an extra dose should be sent to be a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent symptoms should be admitted to the hospital.
