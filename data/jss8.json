MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Diarrhea and transient dizziness were reported in an adult patient following inadvertent administration of 3 ertapenem doses of 1 g each in a 24-hour period. Nausea and vomiting are also possible SEVERE TOXICITY: Based on limited data, severe toxicity has not been reported following overdose.
