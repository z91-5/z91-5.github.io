Also used to treat pruritus, peripheral vertigo, and as a sleep aid. Occasionally used as a drug of abuse for their hallucinogenic effects, primarily by adolescents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is common but rarely severe. May occur via oral, parenteral, or dermal (patches or cream) routes. PHARMACOLOGY: Competitive antagonist of histamine (H1 and H2) receptors. Second generation antihistamines tend to be less sedating as they do not cross the blood-brain barrier as readily as the first generation antihistamines. TOXICOLOGY: Anticholinergic (primarily antimuscarinic) effects develop in overdose due to antagonism of central H1 receptors. Large overdoses of H1 blockers, particularly diphenhydramine, may cause sodium channel antagonism. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Somnolence, anticholinergic effects (ie, mydriasis, flushing, fever, dry mouth, and decreased bowel sounds), tachycardia, mild hypertension, and nausea and vomiting are common after overdose. Agitation, confusion, and hallucinations may develop with moderate poisoning. SEVERE POISONING: Severe effects may include agitated delirium, psychosis, seizures, coma, hypotension, QRS widening, and ventricular dysrhythmias, including torsade de pointe but are generally only reported in adults after very large, deliberate ingestions. Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure may rarely develop in patients with prolonged agitation, coma, or seizures. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Mild sedation, dizziness, impaired coordination, and mild anticholinergic effects. Paradoxical excitation can develop in some patients.<br\/><\/li><li><b>IMIDAZOLINE DECONGESTANTS<\/b><br\/>USES: Used primarily as topical agents to cause vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa and the eye. Common medications include oxymetazoline, tetrahydrozoline, and naphazoline. Surreptitious oral administration of these agents has been reported to facilitate sexual abuse in both adults and children. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents bind to peripheral alpha adrenergic receptors at the site of action (the eye or nose) causing vasoconstriction. TOXICOLOGY: They stimulate the central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors resulting in a net sympatholytic effect. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Uncommon poisoning which can theoretically result in significant morbidity, especially in children although it is very rare to see more than minimal effects. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tachycardia, agitation, pallor, diaphoresis, somnolence, ataxia. SEVERE TOXICITY: Coma, hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, apnea, hypothermia, hyporeflexia. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Headache, nervousness, nausea, dizziness. Rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa) has been described with prolonged use (greater than 5 days).<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"8dsls12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANTIHISTAMINES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The majority of antihistamine overdoses require only supportive care; give activated charcoal if patient presents shortly after ingestion; sedate with benzodiazepines for agitation and delirium. Hypertension and tachycardia are generally mild and well tolerated, and do not require specific treatment. Physostigmine can be used to establish a diagnosis; it may also help avoid an invasive, costly work-up, but should only be given in a setting where intensive monitoring and resuscitation are available. It should NOT be given if there is a history or ECG (QRS widening) evidence that suggests a tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early. Gastric lavage may be of benefit, if the patient presents soon after a large ingestion; administer activated charcoal as well. GI decontamination should be performed only in patients who can protect their airway or who are intubated. Severe delirium may develop and require large doses of benzodiazepines for sedation. Seizures (may rarely progress to status epilepticus) may require aggressive use of benzodiazepines, propofol and\/or barbiturates. Monitor for QRS widening and ventricular dysrhythmias; treat with intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, titrate to blood pH 7.45 to 7.55), or lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate unsuccessful. Monitor core temperature and treat hyperthermia with aggressive benzodiazepine sedation to control agitation and external cooling. Clinical manifestations may be prolonged due to delayed absorption in the setting of an anticholinergic ileus.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures. For dermal exposure, remove patches and wash skin thoroughly. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal if recent, substantial ingestion, and patient able to protect airway. Consider gastric lavage in recent, large (greater than 1 g) ingestion, but first protect the airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (i.e., seizures, dysrhythmias, severe delirium or hyperthermia).<\/li><li>Antidote: Physostigmine is indicated to reverse the CNS effects caused by clinical or toxic dosages of agents capable of producing anticholinergic syndrome; however, long lasting reversal of anticholinergic signs and symptoms is generally not achieved because of the relatively short duration of action of physostigmine (45 to 60 minutes).  It is most often used diagnostically to distinguish anticholinergic delirium from other causes of altered mental status. CAUTION: If tricyclic antidepressants are coingested, physostigmine may precipitate seizures and dysrhythmias. DOSES: ADULT: 2 mg IV at a slow controlled rate, no more than 1 mg\/min. May repeat doses at intervals of 10 to 30 min if severe symptoms recur. For patients with prolonged anticholinergic delirium consider a continuous infusion, start at 2 mg\/hr and titrate to effect. CHILD: 0.02 mg\/kg by slow IV injection, at a rate no more than 0.5 mg\/minute. Repeat dosage at 5 to 10 minute intervals as long as the toxic effect persists and there is no sign of cholinergic effects. MAXIMUM DOSAGE: 2 mg total.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: DYSRHYTHMIAS: QRS widening or ventricular tachycardia may respond to sodium bicarbonate. A reasonable starting dose is 1 to 2 mEq\/kg bolus; repeat as needed. Endpoints include resolution of dysrhythmias, narrowing of QRS complex, and a blood pH of 7.45 to 7.55. Use lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate is not successful.<\/li><li>Seizure: Most seizures are self-limited or respond to intravenous benzodiazepines. Patients with recurrent or recalcitrant seizures should be treated with propofol or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: HYPERTHERMIA: Control agitation with benzodiazepines, initiate aggressive external cooling measures (i.e., remove patient clothing, cover with a wet sheet or keep skin damp and direct fans at the patient's skin to enhance evaporation).<\/li><li>Delirium:  Sedate patient with benzodiazepines until the patient is sleepy. Large doses (greater than 10 mg of lorazepam) may be required.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (including temperature) and mental status. No specific lab work is needed in most patients. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with significant toxicity (i.e., agitation, delirium, seizures, coma, and hypotension). Monitor creatinine phosphokinase in patients with prolonged agitation, seizures, or coma; monitor renal function and urine output in patients with rhabdomyolysis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are of no value in this setting.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children (other than mild drowsiness or stimulation) with acute inadvertent ingestions may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions and symptomatic patients should be sent to a health care facility for observation for 6 to 8 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous system toxicity (i.e., hallucinations somnolence, delirium, coma) or persistent tachycardia should be admitted. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmisas, or delirium should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (i.e., seizures, dysrhythmias, severe delirium, coma) or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>IMIDAZOLINE DECONGESTANTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Management is primarily supportive. Initially, toxicity may manifest more as peripheral alpha effects causing generalized peripheral vasoconstriction. Agitation has also been described. These effects generally do not require therapy. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Management is primarily supportive. Manifestations are primarily due to central alpha effects. The main concerns in a serious overdose are CNS depression with loss of airway reflexes and respiratory depression. Supplemental oxygen should be administered as necessary. Intubation may be required for children who are severely depressed. Hypotension generally responds to intravenous fluid support only, but uncommonly may require a vasopressor such as dopamine. Hypertension is generally transient and does not require treatment. However, if there are signs of end organ compromise from hypertension, a short-acting antihypertensive (ie, nitroprusside or phentolamine) can be used with close monitoring since hypotension often follows the hypertension. Although there are reports suggesting that naloxone can reverse toxicity from clonidine (a drug with a mechanism of action similar to imidazolines), the use of naloxone for imidazoline poisoning is even less well characterized and cannot be routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Decontamination is unlikely to be of benefit in these cases since these are primarily liquid ingestions which will be absorbed quickly. In addition, these agents may cause CNS depression, so the risk of decontamination generally exceeds any potential benefit. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is unlikely to be of benefit in these cases since these are primarily liquid ingestions which will be absorbed quickly. In addition, patients (children in particular) may become lethargic quickly.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who are comatose or with altered mental status may need mechanical respiratory support and orotracheal intubation.<\/li><li>Antidote: There are no specific antidotes. Although there are reports suggesting that naloxone can reverse toxicity from clonidine (a drug with a mechanism of action similar to imidazolines), the use of naloxone for imidazoline poisoning is even less well characterized and cannot be routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl 10 to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Generally hypertension is transient and does not warrant treatment. If severe, short acting agents (ie, nitroprusside or phentolamine) should be used.<\/li><li>Bradycardia: Treatment is only indicated in symptomatic patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. Atropine is the first line therapy. Atropine - Adult - 0.5 mg to 1 mg IV, repeat every 5 minutes if bradycardia persists. Pediatric - 0.02 mg\/kg IV or intraosseously.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific lab work (CBC, electrolytes, urinalysis) is required. Consider arterial or venous blood gas measurements in serious cases. Obtain an ECG in symptomatic patients. Obtain a CT scan in patients with profound CNS depression to evaluate for other causes.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Enhanced elimination has no role in these ingestions.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Any adult with an intentional ingestion or a symptomatic child should be referred to a healthcare facility. Young children have developed serious adverse effects after ingesting as little as 1 to 2 mL of formulations of eye drops or nasal spray (concentrations not specified) containing imidazoline decongestants (eg, tetrahydrozoline, oxymetazoline, or naphazoline). OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be observed for a minimum of 6 hours after a suspected ingestion and can be discharged if asymptomatic after that time.
