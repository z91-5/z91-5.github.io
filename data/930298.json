treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy, 12 years of age or older, with or without development of generalized seizures secondarily. PHARMACOLOGY: Although the exact mechanism of action of perampanel has not been fully determined, it exerts its antiepileptic effects by reducing neuronal excitation via the noncompetitive antagonism of the ionotropic-AMPA-glutamate receptor on postsynaptic neurons. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Overdose data are limited. In general, overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic administration. Ingestion of 264 mg resulted in altered mental status, agitation, and aggressive behavior. A woman developed dysarthria, mild tiredness, impairment of consciousness, including intermittent agitation, misperception, disorientation of the situation after ingesting 204 mg (25.5 times her daily dose) of perampanel. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse effects following therapeutic administration, with an incidence of at least 4% and occurring at least 1% higher than in the placebo group, include dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, irritability, dysarthria, falls, nausea, weight gain, vertigo, ataxia, gait disturbance, and balance disorder. LESS FREQUENT: Other adverse effects that have occurred less frequently include: diplopia, blurred vision, constipation, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, contusion, head injury, limb injury, skin laceration, hyponatremia, arthralgia, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, pain in extremity, peripheral edema, asthenia, abnormal coordination, headache, hypersomnia, hypesthesia, memory impairment, paresthesia, aggression, anger, anxiety, confusion, euphoria, altered mental status, cough, and oropharyngeal pain.<br\/>"},{"id":"930298-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PERAMPANEL<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Control agitation and confusion with benzodiazepines. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe vomiting.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is alert and able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting. Plasma concentrations of perampanel are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding (approximately 96%).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults who inadvertently ingest an extra dose, or asymptomatic children who ingest a few pills can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, should be referred to a healthcare facility to be monitored for several hours. Signs and symptoms may be prolonged due to the long half-life of perampanel. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted.
