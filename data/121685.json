It is anticipated that the primary effect following overdose would be constipation and possible obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effect following therapeutic use is constipation. Age greater than 60 years and high-dose therapy are predisposing factors for the development of constipation, and the constipation is typically mild and transient. INFREQUENT: Other adverse effects that may occur with cholestyramine therapy include abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, steatorrhea, deficiencies of vitamin A, D, and K, hyperchloremic acidosis in children, osteoporosis, and rashes of the skin, tongue, and perianal area.
