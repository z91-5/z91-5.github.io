Corticosteroids are available in oral, parenteral, inhalational, and topical formulations. PHARMACOLOGY: Multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions. Anti-inflammatory effects result from decreased formation, release and activity of the mediators of inflammation (eg, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) which reduced the initial manifestations of the inflammatory process. The immunosuppressive properties decrease the response to delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, type III and type IV).  The antiproliferative effects reduce hyperplastic tissue characteristic of psoriasis. TOXICOLOGY: Corticosteroids decrease calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion, and inhibit osteoblast formation, leading to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute toxicity following overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Acute ingestion is rarely a clinical problem. Acute adrenal insufficiency rarely reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial fibrillation)(methylPREDNISolone), seizures (methylPREDNISolone), anaphylaxis. CHRONIC EXPOSURE:  Cushingoid appearance, muscle wasting and weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia, subcapsulary cataracts and glaucoma, osteoporosis, psychosis. ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL:  Dysphoria, irritability, emotional liability, depression, fatigue,  anxiety, depersonalization, myalgia, and arthralgia.<br\/><\/li><li><b>HYDROXYQUINOLINES <\/b><br\/>USES: The halogenated hydroxyquinolines have antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal activity. Iodoquinol was approved for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis. Clioquinol was formerly given to treat intestinal amebiasis and traveller's diarrhea.  Because of the neurotoxicity seen between 1955 and 1970, clioquinol and similar halogenated hydroxyquinolines have been taken off the market in many countries. In several countries, clioquinol is now mainly used as creams and ointments (3%) to treat skin infections. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents have antibacterial, antifungal, and some antitrichomonal activity. The exact mechanism of action of iodoquinol is unknown. Iodoquinol produces its amebicidal effect at the site of infection against Entamoeba histolytica and can be used against trophozoite and cyst forms. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and can reach high concentrations in the intestinal lumen. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Clinical events following exposure are anticipated to be an extension of adverse events. Overdose may produce CNS toxicity.  ADVERSE EFFECTS: These compounds may cause gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, allergic reactions, and thyroid enlargement, but they are primarily known for their neurotoxicity, with both spinal cord and optic nerve damage.  Iodoquinol therapy can cause skin eruptions (eg, acneiform papular and pustular, bullae, vegetating or tuberous iododerma), urticaria, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, chills, headache, vertigo, and enlarged thyroid. Seizures and encephalopathy were observed in a 9-year-old boy who received iodoquinol therapy. Prolonged high-dose treatment with 8-hydroxyquinoline can cause optic neuritis, optic atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with tiliquinol and tilbroquinol use. Chronic administration of high doses of clioquinol has resulted in a condition called subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy (SMON).  Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, paresthesias leading to paraplegia, and loss of vision.  The drug affects the long fibres of the spinal cord, and the optic nerve. A woman developed muscle wasting, optic neuritis, sphincter disturbances, and flaccid paraplegia after taking clioquinol for a month.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930826-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is not expected after overdose; gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. Activated charcoal should be considered after extremely large ingestions or if more toxic coingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe allergic reactions, but this is rare.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Monitor airway.

An adolescent ingested 30 mg dexamethasone and subsequently developed acute adrenal insufficiency. Patient recovered following administration of methylPREDNISolone. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: Six infants (aged 3 to 8 months) who were treated with large amounts (up to 10 tubes for 1.5 to 5 months) of topical corticosteroids for diaper dermatitis developed Cushing's syndrome and adrenocortical insufficiency. Hepatomegaly and hepatosteatosis were observed in 5 and 3 patients, respectively. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Varies with drug and indication.<br\/><\/li><li><b>HYDROXYQUINOLINES <\/b><br\/>TOXICOLOGY: IODOQUINOL: Overdose data with iodoquinol are limited. Seizures and encephalopathy were observed in a 9-year-old boy who received 420 mg of iodoquinol 3 times daily for 12 days. CLIOQUINOL: Extended treatment with oral doses greater than 2 grams daily has caused toxicity with subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy being most significant. Due to this toxicity, oral preparations of clioquinol are unavailable in most countries, including the United States.  A woman who was taking about clioquinol 1 to 1.5 grams daily (total dose: 28 grams) for a month, developed muscle wasting, optic neuritis, sphincter disturbances, and flaccid paraplegia. The following provides the estimated clioquinol neurotoxic dose-response: Little or No Risk: 750 mg\/day for 4 weeks or less. 1% Incidence of Neurotoxicity: 750 to 1,500 mg\/day for less than 2 weeks. 35% Incidence of Neurotoxicity: 750 to 1,500 mg\/day for over 2 weeks. When doses higher than these are administered, toxicity may start within 24 hours of initiation of these doses. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: IODOQUINOL (DIIODOHYDROXYQUINOLINE): ADULTS: To treat intestinal amebiasis, 3 tablets (210 mg each) 3 times daily orally for 20 days OR 1 tablet (650 mg each) 3 times daily orally for 20 days. PEDIATRIC: To treat intestinal amebiasis, 10 to 13.3 mg\/kg 3 times daily for 20 days. MAX daily dose is 1.95 g. CLIOQUINOL:  To treat intestinal amebiasis, 250 mg 3 times daily orally for 10 days were recommended.  This regimen was repeated after an 8-day rest period.  Due to the risk of neurotoxicity, oral preparations of clioquinol are unavailable in most countries including the United States.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"}]}}}
