Toxic effects can include tachycardia, fever, hypertension, vasodilation, urinary retention, behavioral disturbances, slowed GI motility, decreased sweating and decreased salivation. ADVERSE EFFECTS: In adults signs and symptoms noted were tachycardia, nausea, weakness,  headache, delusions, dizziness, dry mouth, light-headedness, mood swings,  loss of balance, incoordination, and mental depression. Children may develop clouding of the sensorium, hallucinations,  disorientation, slurred speech, ataxia, and hyperactivity.

Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Physostigmine: Physostigmine is indicated to reverse the CNS effects caused by clinical or toxic dosages of agents capable of producing anticholinergic syndrome; however, long lasting reversal of anticholinergic signs and symptoms is generally not achieved because of the relatively short duration of action of physostigmine (45 to 60 minutes).  It is most often used diagnostically to distinguish anticholinergic delirium from other causes of altered mental status. CAUTION: If tricyclic antidepressants are coingested, physostigmine may precipitate seizures and dysrhythmias. DOSES: ADULT: 2 mg IV at a slow controlled rate, no more than 1 mg\/min. May repeat doses at intervals of 10 to 30 min if severe symptoms recur. For patients with prolonged anticholinergic delirium consider a continuous infusion, start at 2 mg\/hr and titrate to effect. CHILD: 0.02 mg\/kg by slow IV injection, at a rate no more than 0.5 mg\/minute. Repeat dosage at 5 to 10 minute intervals as long as the toxic effect persists and there is no sign of cholinergic effects.

The higher the concentration of the drops, and the more often they are used, the greater the chance of toxicity.  CHILDREN: Therapeutic use of a 2% solution in 40 children resulted in 5 cases of acute psychotic reactions. THERAPEUTIC: ADULT\/CHILDREN: Instill 1 or 2 drops of 1% or 2% solution in the eye and may be repeated 5 to 10 min later with a 1% solution if needed. INFANTS: Instill 1 drop of 0.5% solution and apply pressure to nasolacrimal sac for 2 to 3 min in order to minimize absorption.
