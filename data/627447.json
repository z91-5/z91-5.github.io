ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: Rash and pruritus. Other effects have included: Nausea and vomiting, glossitis, epigastric distress, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, megaloblastic anemia, and methemoglobinemia. RARE: Exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis, cholestatic jaundice and aseptic meningitis have occurred. CHRONIC: High dose therapy and\/or extended use may cause bone marrow depression manifested as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and megaloblastic anemia. OPHTHALMIC PREPARATIONS: Significant toxicity is NOT expected to occur following acute ingestion or topical application of ophthalmic preparations containing trimethoprim. Local irritation consisting of redness, burning, stinging, and\/or itching have been reported following the use of trimethoprim\/polymyxin B sulfate ophthalmic solution.<br\/><\/li><li><b>TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE<\/b><br\/>USES: Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is a synthetic antibacterial combination product. It is used in a wide variety of infections due to susceptible organisms, in particular those of the urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts. PHARMACOLOGY: The combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole block 2 steps in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to the growth of many bacteria. Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. Sulfamethoxazole is able to inhibit the bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para-aminnobezoic acid (PABA). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common, but severe toxicity is unlikely to occur. OVERDOSE: TOXICITY: TRIMETHOPRIM: Nausea and vomiting, dizziness, headache, mental depression, confusion, and bone marrow depression can occur with a trimethoprim overdose. SULFONAMIDES: Anorexia, colic, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, unconsciousness, pyrexia, hematuria, crystalluria, renal insufficiency, blood dyscrasias and jaundice can occur with a sulfonamide overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea and vomiting, anorexia and allergic skin reactions (e.g., rash and urticaria) are the most common adverse events.  INFREQUENT: Severe reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, other blood dyscrasias have occurred. RARE: Hypersensitivity of the respiratory tract has resulted in death in some cases. CHRONIC USE: Ongoing high dose use and\/or extended periods of use may result in bone marrow depression and include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and\/or megaloblastic anemia.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"627447-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>TRIMETHOPRIM<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Consider activated charcoal if airway is protected.

Gastrointestinal symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are likely to occur and mild symptoms can be managed with oral fluids; IV fluids and antiemetics may be needed if symptoms persist or become significant. Monitor urine output. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat gastrointestinal symptoms as needed. Obtain electrolytes, if symptoms persist. Monitor CNS function. Drowsiness, depression, and confusion can develop. Hypoglycemia may develop in patients receiving high doses; monitor glucose as indicated. Severe toxicity is not anticipated. RARE: In rare cases, severe bone marrow depression including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and\/or megaloblastic anemia may develop. Severe even fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with therapeutic use and may begin as a skin rash and can progress to severe reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis, and severe blood dyscrasias. Monitor CBC with differential and hepatic and renal function.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is unlikely after acute ingestion and gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Obtain a baseline CBC with differential, electrolytes and renal function following a significant exposure. Patients may be discharged to home once symptoms have resolved and laboratory studies are within normal limits. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients experiencing severe or persistent anaphylactic symptoms or who develop evidence of blood dyscrasias should be admitted for further monitoring and treatment as indicated. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or regional poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.
