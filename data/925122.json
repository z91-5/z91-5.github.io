Its radionuclide emissions permit external imaging of the cerebral distribution of the agent, thus allowing the detection of altered regional cerebral perfusion. The retention in the brain of technetium Tc 99m bicisate results from in vivo metabolism (de-esterification) of the primary complex to polar, less diffusable compounds (mono- and di-acids).<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"925122-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"925122-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Tmax, IV; 0.5 minutes <br\/>"},{"id":"925122-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Protein binding: 0% <br\/>"},{"id":"925122-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Brain: extensive<\/li><li>Technetium Tc-99m bicisate mono-acid: inactive<\/li><li>Technetium Tc-99m bicisate di-acid: inactive<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"925122-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Fecal, 12.5% changed<\/li><li>Renal, 74% changed<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"925122-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"49.5 minutes <br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"925122-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>patient should be well hydrated prior to administration and encouraged to drink fluids liberally and void frequently for 2 to 6 hours after injection<\/li><li> not to be administered directly to the patient; proper preparation is required<\/li><li>write the estimated activity, date, and time of preparation on the space provided on the label and attach to the neck of the vial<\/li><li>water proof gloves should be worn during preparation<\/li><li>in a suitable radiation shield add 3.7 gigabecquerels (100 millicuries) pertechnetate Tc 99m injection (in approximately 2 mL) to vial B; remove an equal amount of air without withdrawing the needle<\/li><li>rapidly inject 3 mL of normal saline into vial A and remove an equal amount of air without withdrawing the needle<\/li><li>shake the vial for a few seconds to dissolve the contents<\/li><li>within 30 seconds transfer 1 mL from vial A to vial B and discard vial A immediately<\/li><li>swirl vial B and allow mixture to stand for 30 seconds<\/li><li>assay the product with a suitable dose calibrator<\/li><li>use dose within 6 hours of preparation<\/li><li> brain images are visible from 10 minutes to 6 hours after injection with optimal images occurring 30 to 60 minutes after injection<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"925122-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>image quality or evaluative usefulness in stroke localization is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>predose renal function tests in the elderly<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"925122-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>This drug may cause headache, dizziness, seizure, agitation, malaise, hallucinations, rash, nausea, syncope, angina, or apnea\/cyanosis.<\/li><li>Tell patient to maintain adequate hydration and void frequently during the 2 to 6 hours following administration to minimize radiation to the bladder and other target organs.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
