PHARMACOLOGY: Amantadine is a weak dopamine agonist, with some antimuscarinic activity, and a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. Amantadine inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of catecholamines and increases dopamine release. It may also directly stimulate the dopamine receptor to make the postsynaptic dopamine system more sensitive to the presence of dopamine. Amantadine exerts antiviral activity by inhibiting the replication of the influenza A virus. TOXICOLOGY: Works at antimuscarinic receptors leading to anticholinergic effects. It also inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of catecholamines and can cause increased dopaminergic and sympathomimetic postsynaptic stimulation. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Amantadine exposures are uncommon; most patients will not have significant symptoms. There are isolated reports of seizures, dysrhythmias, and psychiatric symptoms following large exposures. MILD TO MODERATE OVERDOSE: Anticholinergic effects of dry mouth, mydriasis, tachycardia, and urinary retention have been reported with acute overdose ingestions of amantadine. Nausea, dizziness, insomnia, agitation, anxiety, headache, and dystonic reactions may also develop. SEVERE OVERDOSE: May cause ventricular dysrhythmias, torsades de pointes, hyperthermia, QRS widening, prolonged QTc, hallucinations, psychosis, hypotension, acute lung injury, hypokalemia, lethargy, ataxia, and seizures. Patients with renal insufficiency may have increased risk of toxicity. Serotonin syndrome may develop when amantadine is taken concomitantly with other serotonergic agents. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Anticholinergic symptoms of dry mouth, tachycardia, and difficulty in focusing are seen even with therapeutic administration. Other common adverse effects that may occur include nausea, dizziness, insomnia, agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, peripheral edema, headache, and orthostatic hypotension. Dose reduction or abrupt withdrawal of amantadine therapy may result in the development of manifestations of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, such as hyperthermia, rigidity, and autonomic instability.<br\/>"},{"id":"h7gs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AMANTADINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Care is symptomatic and supportive. Treat dystonic reactions with benzodiazepines or diphenhydramine. Treat anxiety and agitation with benzodiazepines. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Care is symptomatic and supportive. Treat hallucinations and psychosis with benzodiazepines. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines as needed; if refractory, consider phenobarbital or propofol. Treat hypotension with intravenous fluids; add vasopressors if necessary. Treat torsades de pointes with magnesium, overdrive pacing. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Treat QRS widening with sodium bicarbonate. Treat serotonin syndrome with benzodiazepines and cyproheptadine if symptoms persist. Severe cases may require neuromuscular paralysis and mechanical ventilation.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and seizures. HOSPITAL: Consider administration of activated charcoal in patients with a recent ingestion who are awake and able to protect their airway. It is most effective when administered within one hour of ingestion. Do not administer in patients who are at risk for abrupt onset of seizure or mental status depression unless airway is protected. Consider gastric lavage only in recent large overdose (2 g) as overdose is rarely life-threatening.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with persistent seizures, mental status depression, or an inability to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring, obtain an ECG, and administer oxygen.  Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders.  Because amantadine can cause torsades de pointes and QTc prolongation, amiodarone should only be used with extreme caution. Consider lidocaine for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Sodium bicarbonate may be effective for ventricular dysrhythmias, particularly in association  with QRS widening.  Administer sodium bicarbonate 1 to 2 milliequivalents\/kilogram intravenously.  Repeat as needed to achieve an arterial pH of 7.4 to 7.5.  Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Electrical cardioversion if hemodynamically unstable. Treat stable patients with magnesium (first-line agent) and\/or atrial overdrive pacing. Correct electrolyte abnormalities (ie, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia) and hypoxia, if present. Avoid class Ia (eg, quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (eg, flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics.<\/li><li>Rhabdomyolysis: IV 0.9% NS to maintain urine output of 2 to 3 mL\/kg\/h.<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: Control agitation and muscle activity with benzodiazepines. Enhance evaporative cooling by keeping skin damp with water\/ice packs and using cooling fans.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, neurologic exam, and mental status. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. Monitor electrolytes (including magnesium, potassium, and calcium), and renal function. Specific amantadine concentrations are not readily available or useful to assist acute management.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: These procedures have not been shown to be effective because the volume of distribution is large. Since the serum half-life is very long in patients with renal failure, dialysis may be necessary in patients with poor renal function.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of an extra dose and asymptomatic children with inadvertent ingestions of a single pill can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions, and children ingesting more than a pill should be referred to a healthcare facility. Monitor asymptomatic patients with significant exposures for at least 8 to 12 hours after ingestion. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All patients with more than mild symptoms should be admitted to the hospital.
