Thus, sodium phenylbutyrate decreases elevated plasma ammonia glutamine concentrations in patients with urea cycle disorders.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"923656-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"923656-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Phenylacetate (active metabolite), Tmax, Oral (tablets and powder): 3.55 to 3.74 hours<\/li><li>Phenylacetate (active metabolite), Tmax, IV: 30 to 60 minutes<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923656-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>phenylbutyrate (prodrug) and phenylacetylglutamine (metabolite), Vd: 0.2 L\/kg<\/li><li>phenylacetate (active metabolite), Vd: 0.3 L\/kg<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923656-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Hepatic and renal: rapid and extensive.<\/li><li>Phenylacetate: active metabolite.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923656-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 80 to 100% as phenylacetylglutamine.<\/li><li>Total body clearance: 18 mg\/hour\/kg<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923656-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Phenylacetate (active metabolite): 1.15 to 1.29 hours<\/li><li>Sodium phenylbutyrate (prodrug): 0.76 to 0.77 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}]},"9":{"id":"923656-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>powder may be mixed with solid food, liquid food, or water; give orally via mouth, gastrostomy, or nasogastric tube only; shake lightly before use.<\/li><li>powder: once mixed with food, give immediately; if mixed with water, may be stored at room temperature or refrigerated and given within 1 week<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"923656-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Oral Powder: 3 GM\/Dose<br\/><\/li><li><b>Buphenyl<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Powder: 3 GM\/Dose<\/li><li>Oral Tablet: 500 MG<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>SPB11<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet, Enteric Coated: 1000 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"923656-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Counsel patient with congestive heart failure or renal failure that product contains significant amounts of sodium and may cause edema.<\/li><li>Drug may cause amenorrhea, menstrual dysfunction, body odor, or changes in taste.<\/li><li>Instruct patient or caregiver to immediately report signs\/symptoms of hyperammonemia (eg, irritability, poor feeding, or vomiting in infant; unstable gait, irritability, sleep disturbances, or hyperactivity in older children\/adults).<\/li><li>Advise patient to adhere to dietary restrictions with respect to protein intake or additional supplements if needed.<\/li><li>Advise patient that drug should be taken in equally divided amounts with food.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to take a missed dose as soon as possible on the same day.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
