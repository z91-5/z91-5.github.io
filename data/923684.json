Bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution (Latisse(R)) is also indicated for the treatment of hypotrichosis of the eyelashes.  Refer to BETA-BLOCKING AGENTS management for more information about timolol. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents are prostaglandin analogs and selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist. Latanoprost, tafluprost, and travoprost reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing uveoscleral outflow. Bimatoprost lowers IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral drainage systems. The exact mechanism of action for bimatoprost in stimulating eyelash growth is unknown; it may work by increasing the duration and the percentage of hairs in the anagen or growth phase. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. The risk of toxicity from inadvertent ingestion is low because the amount contained in the bottles of ophthalmic solution is small. LATANOPROST: There are no reports of ingestion or ocular administration of large doses of latanoprost in humans.  No adverse effects were reported after intravenous infusion of up to 3 mcg\/kg (produced greater than 200 times therapeutic plasma level) in healthy volunteers. Intravenous doses of 5.5 to 10 mcg\/kg in healthy volunteers caused abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue, hot flashes, nausea, and sweating. However, latanoprost is only available as ophthalmic solutions. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following ocular effects have been reported in patients using the ophthalmic products: Conjunctival hyperemia, iris pigmentation, abnormal vision, blurred vision, allergic conjunctivitis, eye discharge, tearing, photophobia, ocular dryness, visual disturbance, burning, eye pain, blepharitis, cataracts, superficial punctate keratitis, eyelid erythema, pruritus, conjunctival edema, and macular edema. Punctate epithelial keratopathy, ocular hypotony, choroidal effusions, and dendritiform epitheliopathy were reported with latanoprost. OTHER EFFECTS: Bimatoprost: Elevated liver enzymes, headache, asthenia. Latanoprost: Chest pain and\/or angina, muscle, joint and back pain, dizziness, headache. Travoprost: Hypertension, chest pain and\/or angina, bradycardia, headache. Tafluprost: headache. <br\/>"},{"id":"923684-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b> LATANOPROST AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Significant toxicity is not expected after an overdose. Perform an ophthalmologic exam (including visual acuity and slit lamp) in any patient with persistent eye irritation.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Although these agents have not been associated with oral toxicity, inadvertent ingestion of the ophthalmic solution may occur. Due to limited expected toxicity, gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely recommended. Since the amounts of active ingredient available in ophthalmic solutions are very small, acute overdose in adults is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse events. OCULAR: Flush eyes with copious amounts of water; if symptoms persist an eye exam may be indicated. HOSPITAL: Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. OCULAR: Flush eyes with copious amounts of water; if symptoms persist an eye exam may be indicated.<\/li><li>Airway management: Should not be required in these cases.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension does not usually require treatment. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside or phentolamine are preferred, with nitroglycerin or labetalol as alternatives.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not recommended. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Monitor vital signs in symptomatic patients. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with symptoms or with deliberate overdose should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or for whom diagnosis is unclear. Consult an ophthalmologist for managing a patient with severe eye irritation.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923684-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>LATANOPROST AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: No toxic ingestions have been reported.
