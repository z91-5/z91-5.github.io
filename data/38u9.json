PHARMACOLOGY: Inhibition of alpha and gamma motor neurons via the brain stem. TOXICOLOGY: Displays anticholinergic, antihistaminergic, and CNS depressant effects in overdose. It is also a weak norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is common but rarely severe. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Sedation, anticholinergic effects (ie, mydriasis, flushing, fever, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, hallucinations), sinus tachycardia, mild hypertension or hypotension, and nausea and vomiting are common after overdose. SEVERE POISONING: Severe effects may include significant hypotension, respiratory depression, and coma. Cyclobenzaprine is a cyclic amine with structural similarity to the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline. Therefore, theoretically, conduction delays and ventricular dysrhythmias are of concern but are exceedingly rare even in large overdoses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Sedation, flushing, dry mouth, and hallucinations.<br\/>"},{"id":"38u9s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CYCLOBENZAPRINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The vast majority of cyclobenzaprine overdoses require only supportive care; activated charcoal is indicated if patients present shortly after ingestion. Treat agitation and delirium with benzodiazepines. Hypotension normally responds well to hydration. Hypertension and tachycardia are generally mild and well tolerated, and do not require specific treatment. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients who experience respiratory compromise or significant CNS depression require early endotracheal intubation for airway protection. While activated charcoal is indicated in these cases, it should be performed only in patients who can protect their airway or who are intubated due to the predictable CNS depression and risk of aspiration. Those experiencing severe anticholinergic features, such as delirium and agitation, may require large doses of benzodiazepines for sedation. Physostigmine is an alternative to reverse CNS anticholinergic effects. Seizures are very rare and typically respond to benzodiazepines. Monitor for QRS widening and ventricular dysrhythmias; treat with intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, titrate to blood pH 7.45 to 7.55). Monitor core temperature and treat hyperthermia with aggressive benzodiazepine sedation to control agitation, and external cooling. Clinical manifestations may be prolonged due to prolonged absorption in the setting of anticholinergic ileus.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of potential for profound somnolence. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be given to those who are able to reliably protect their airway. Fatalities are extremely rare, and gastric lavage is generally not indicated.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (seizures, dysrhythmias, severe delirium, CNS or respiratory depression).<\/li><li>Antidote: Physostigmine is indicated to reverse the CNS effects caused by clinical or toxic dosages of agents capable of producing anticholinergic syndrome; however, long lasting reversal of anticholinergic signs and symptoms is generally not achieved because of the relatively short duration of action of physostigmine (45 to 60 minutes).  It is most often used diagnostically to distinguish anticholinergic delirium from other causes of altered mental status. CAUTION: If tricyclic antidepressants are coingested, physostigmine may precipitate seizures and dysrhythmias. DOSES: ADULT: 2 mg IV at a slow controlled rate, no more than 1 mg\/min. May repeat doses at intervals of 10 to 30 min if severe symptoms recur. For patients with prolonged anticholinergic delirium consider a continuous infusion, start at 2 mg\/hr and titrate to effect. CHILD: 0.02 mg\/kg by slow IV injection, at a rate no more than 0.5 mg\/minute. Repeat dosage at 5 to 10 minute intervals as long as the toxic effect persists and there is no sign of cholinergic effects. MAXIMUM DOSAGE: 2 mg total.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: QRS widening or ventricular tachycardia may respond to sodium bicarbonate. A reasonable starting dose is 1 to 2 mEq\/kg bolus, repeat as needed, endpoints include resolution of dysrhythmias, narrowing of QRS complex, and blood pH 7.45 to 7.55. Use lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate is not successful.<\/li><li>Seizure: Intravenous benzodiazepines, propofol, or barbiturates<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: Control agitation with benzodiazepines; initiate aggressive external cooling measures.<\/li><li>Delirium: Sedate patient with benzodiazepines as necessary; large doses may be required.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. No specific lab work is needed in most patients. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with moderate to severe toxicity (agitation, delirium, seizures, coma, hypotension). Monitor creatinine phosphokinase in patients with prolonged agitation, seizures, or coma. Monitor renal function and urine output in patients with rhabdomyolysis. Cyclobenzaprine will cause a urine tricyclic antidepressant screen to be positive. Cyclobenzaprine plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children (other than mild drowsiness or stimulation) with small ingestions (1 to 2 pills) may be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or children with significant ingestions should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation for 6 to 8 hours. All symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation for 6 to 8 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous system toxicity (hallucinations, somnolence, delirium, coma), or those with persistent abnormal vital signs, such as tachycardia and hypotension, should be admitted. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, or delirium should be admitted to an intensive care setting.
