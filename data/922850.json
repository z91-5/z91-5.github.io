Trazodone is pharmacologically similar to nefazodone and may produce similar effects in overdose.  Commonly reported effects with trazodone overdose include CNS depression, nausea and vomiting. RARE: Coma, but may be prolonged. Seizures and mild cardiovascular abnormalities (bradycardia and transient first degree heart block). ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: Headache, dizziness, light-headedness, somnolence, dry mouth, nausea, confusion and visual disturbances including blurred vision. Postural hypotension may occur with therapy. Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported with therapy. Sinus bradycardia has been reported infrequently on ECG, but was not clinically significant. RARE: Based on postmarketing experience, seizures and priapism have developed.

IV benzodiazepines if seizures develop.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor pulse, blood pressure, ECG, liver function tests. Monitor neurologic and respiratory status.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Since nefazodone is pharmacologically related to trazodone, which is known to produce a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval, ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, are possible. IV magnesium, overdrive pacing, may be indicated. Correct electrolyte abnormalities.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of therapy. Cyproheptadine, a 5-HT antagonist, is frequently used; Adult - 12 mg initially followed by 2 mg every 2 hours if symptoms persist, up to a max of 32 mg in 24 hours. Child - 0.25 mg\/kg\/day divided every 6 hours, max dose 12 mg\/day. Severe cases of serotonin syndrome have been managed with benzodiazepine sedation and neuromuscular paralysis with nondepolarizing agents. Bromocriptine is NOT recommended.<\/li><li>Priapism: Priapism may occur following a nefazodone overdose. An immediate urological consult is necessary. Clinical history should include the use of other agents (ie, antihypertensives, antidepressants, illegal agents) that may also be contributing to priapism. In a patient with ischemic priapism the corpora cavernosa are often completely rigid and the patient complains of pain, while nonischemic priapism the corpora are typically tumescent, but not completely rigid and pain is not typical. Aspirate blood from the corpus cavernosum with a fine needle. Blood gas testing of the aspirated blood may be used to distinguish ischemic (typically PO2 less than 30 mmHg, PCO2 greater than 60 mmHg, and pH less than 7.25) and nonischemic priapism. Color duplex ultrasonography may also be useful. If priapism persists after aspiration, inject a sympathomimetic. PHENYLEPHRINE: Dose: Adult: For intracavernous injection, dilute phenylephrine with normal saline for a concentration of 100 to 500 mcg\/mL and give 1 mL injections every 3 to 5 minutes for approximately 1 hour (before deciding that treatment is not successful). For children and patients with cardiovascular disease: Use lower concentrations in smaller volumes. NOTE: Treatment is less likely to be effective if done more than 48 hours after the development of priapism.
