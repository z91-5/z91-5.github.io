PHARMACOLOGY:  Acts on the benzodiazepine binding site on the chloride channel of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in the CNS, and increases the frequency of chloride channel opening. This hyperpolarizes the cell and prevents nerve firing\/stimulation, resulting in generalized depression of spinal reflexes and the reticular activating system causing CNS depression. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicity is an extension of the pharmacology, increased GABA activity causing CNS depression. While coma and respiratory depression are rare, they may occur with large overdoses or coingestions. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is common and usually occurs in combination with other drug ingestions. Outcomes are generally good. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: CNS depression is the most common finding after overdose. Respiratory depression may also occur, but is more common with coingestion of other sedative-hypnotics. Ataxia, confusion, diminished reflexes, impaired coordination, lethargy, sleepiness, and slurred speech are common with overdose. Dilated pupils may be present in overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Respiratory depression\/arrest may occur with large overdoses. Severity of respiratory effects depends on the amount ingested and absorbed and coingestants. Atrioventricular block has been reported following overdose. In high doses, patients may manifest coma and respiratory depression. Otherwise, alprazolam is remarkably safe as a single agent. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects of alprazolam in therapeutic doses usually reflect the drug's pharmacology and include sedation, slurred speech, and ataxia. Tachycardia and hypotension may also occur during therapeutic use. Benzodiazepines may induce or worsen dyskinesia symptoms. Respiratory arrest has occurred following rapid IV administration of therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. Physical and\/or psychological dependence may develop, and a withdrawal syndrome similar to ethanol withdrawal (ie, hypertension, tachycardia, tremulousness, seizures, low grade fever, and, in severe cases, delirium) may develop after abrupt discontinuation in dependent individuals.<br\/>"},{"id":"20400-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ALPRAZOLAM<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: Supportive care with attention to the airway, breathing, and circulation is the mainstay of treatment. Benzodiazepine overdose as a single agent may cause coma but generally does not cause loss of airway reflexes. However, when combined with other sedating drugs (eg, ethanol, opioids, muscle relaxants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants), airway protection may be necessary. Even with large overdoses, patients generally remain hemodynamically stable. MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Coma and respiratory depression require intubation. Hypotension responds to fluids and rarely vasopressors.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is usually not necessary unless the patient has a dangerous co-ingestant. Avoid if the patient is too sedated. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be beneficial if dangerous co-ingestants were consumed and the patient is intubated or can protect their airway. Gastric lavage and whole bowel irrigation are usually not indicated as severe toxicity is very rare.<\/li><li>Airway management: Although respiratory depression is rare, some patients will require airway management.<\/li><li>Antidote: Flumazenil is a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that can rapidly reverse the benzodiazepine effect. However, it is rarely indicated except for iatrogenic oversedation or respiratory depression. In addition, flumazenil may cause withdrawal states and result in seizures, adrenergic stimulation, or autonomic instability in patients chronically taking benzodiazepines, and may cause ventricular dysrhythmias and seizures in patients with concomitant cocaine or tricyclic antidepressant toxicity. The starting dose is 0.1 to 0.2 mg IV over 15 to 30 seconds and repeated as needed to a maximum of 1 mg. Continuous IV infusion from 0.1 to 1 mg\/hr in 0.9% NaCl or D5W may also be used.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitoring vital signs, venous blood gases, ECG, and pulse oximetry may be useful.  Qualitative testing for presence of alprazolam is helpful to confirm presence, especially when overdose history is sketchy; however, quantitative levels are not usually clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for diuresis, dialysis, or hemoperfusion.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Healthy children with unintentional ingestions of 0.5 mg or less may be observed at home if the family is responsible. If significant ataxia or drowsiness develops, refer the patient to the hospital. Asymptomatic adults with unintentional ingestions and a good social situation may remain at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with intentional ingestion or significant ataxia, drowsiness, or respiratory depression should be referred to the hospital for observation. Patients with unreliable social situations may also need observation. Patients may be discharged when asymptomatic. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admit patients with severe symptoms (ie, coma, respiratory failure, or hypotension unresponsive to IV fluids) or if a danger to themselves. Discharge when asymptomatic and when psychiatric issues have been addressed.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"20400-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ALPRAZOLAM<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Deaths from benzodiazepine overdose are extremely rare.  A patient with multiple severe medical problems expired following an overdose of 7.5 mg of alprazolam.  In general, the toxic-to-therapeutic ratio is very high for benzodiazepines, making them remarkably safe medications. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULTS: As an anti-anxiety agent, the recommended dose is 0.25 to 0.5 mg given orally three times a day up to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg.
