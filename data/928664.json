Clindamycin is also used topically to treat acne vulgaris and bacterial vaginosis. PHARMACOLOGY: Clindamycin and lincomycin bind exclusively to the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit and suppress bacterial protein synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose from lincomycin and clindamycin is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. A 12 gram bolus intravenous lincomycin dose produced cardiac arrest immediately following intubation. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Diarrhea has been reported following the administration of lincomycin and clindamycin. Pseudomembranous colitis is a widely reported adverse effect of lincomycin and clindamycin therapy when administered orally and\/or parenterally. It may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. OTHER EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, stomatitis, esophagitis, glossitis, tinnitus, vertigo, and dermatitis. RARE: Steven's-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, acute allergic reactions, sideroblastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, and nephrotoxicity (eg, azotemia, oliguria, and proteinuria). Rapid administration of large doses has resulted in ventricular dysrhythmias, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.<br\/><\/li><li><b>TRETINOIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Tretinoin (All-trans-retinoic acid) and related compounds are forms of vitamin A. Tretinoin topical formulation is used for the treatment of acne vulgaris, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin. Tretinoin oral capsule is used to induce the remission of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Acitretin is used orally for the treatment of severe refractory psoriasis in adults. Refer to &quot;ISOTRETINOIN&quot; management for specific information about isotretinoin. PHARMACOLOGY: The mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated. Tretinoins can affect nuclear transcription in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and protein synthesis. Tretinoin induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells. For acne, it may decrease cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells and decreased microcomedo formation. TOXICOLOGY: In overdose, it can affect multiple organ systems and can be similar to symptoms of hypervitaminosis A. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon and most cases develop only minor symptoms. Severe toxicity is very rare and deaths have not been reported. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and general malaise may occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity includes hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure, renal insufficiency and acute renal failure, hypotension, and acute lung injury. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Common adverse effects with therapeutic dosing include chest discomfort, edema, rash, skin irritation, weight gain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, increased liver enzymes, bone pain, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, fever, and malaise. Pseudotumor cerebri, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia and pancreatitis have been reported. The retinoic acid syndrome can occur after oral administration of tretinoin. Manifestations can include fever, dyspnea, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusion, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension. Topical application causes drying of skin. Tretinoin is a human teratogen.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928664-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>LINCOMYCIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Acute toxicity, other than gastrointestinal discomfort, is not common. Rapid administration of large doses has resulted in hypotension. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The primary toxic effects involve the gastrointestinal tract and may include severe diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis.  Metronidazole for mild to moderate disease and vancomycin for severe disease are recommended in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required. <\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally NOT necessary. HOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is not expected after an overdose. Gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely warranted. Consider activated charcoal after extremely large ingestions or those involving toxic co-ingestants.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be needed following an overdose; however, ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor vital signs, CBC with differential with platelet count, renal function, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with significant overdose. Monitor for clinical evidence of colitis. Evaluate for C, difficile toxin if colitis develops.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: In several studies, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were not effective in reducing lincomycin or clindamycin levels significantly.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patient with inadvertent ingestions who have minimal symptoms can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a health care facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>TRETINOIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Decontamination with soap and water for topical exposures. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Administer antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. If respiratory failure develops, intubation and mechanical ventilation will be required. Hemodialysis may be needed if renal insufficiency and renal failure develop. Dexamethasone (10 mg IV every 12 hours for 3 or more days) may be helpful in patients with retinoic acid syndrome. Benzodiazepines can be used for hypertensive and agitated patients. For severe hypertension, sodium nitroprusside can be used, with nitroglycerin and phentolamine as possible alternatives. Sinus tachycardia does not generally require treatment unless hemodynamic compromise develops.  If therapy is required, a short acting, cardioselective agent such as esmolol is generally preferred.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if large or polypharmacy overdose has occurred. However, patient should be alert, not vomiting and able to maintain the airway. HOSPITAL: Typically there is no role for gastric lavage. Consider activated charcoal if large or polypharmacy overdose has occurred. However, patient should be alert, not vomiting and able to maintain the airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubation and ventilation may be needed if respiratory distress or CNS depression develops, or the patient is unable to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma drug concentrations are not clinically useful. Monitor vital signs after large overdose. Monitor CBC, serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes after large overdose. Monitor for evidence of pseudotumor cerebri (papilledema, headache, sixth nerve palsy). Cranial CT scan and lumbar puncture may also be necessary.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with low dose inadvertent supratherapeutic ingestions who are asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms can be watched at home. In large or self-harm ingestions, or patients with more moderate symptoms may need to be evaluated in the emergency department. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient who is symptomatic, or who took a large or deliberate overdose should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation. Patients should be observed until symptoms have resolved. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have severe toxicity or prolonged toxicity, liver, renal or CNS effects should be admitted for further evaluation.
