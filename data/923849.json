Opioids are commonly abused for euphoric effects by multiple routes (ie, injection, insufflation, smoking, ingestion and transdermal). The following agents and opioid withdrawal have their own specific managements, please refer to them as indicated: buprenorphine, butorphanol, codeine, dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, long-acting opioid antagonists (nalmefene, naltrexone, nalmexone), meperidine, methadone, methadone, oxycodone, pentazocine, propoxyphene, tramadol. PHARMACOLOGY: Opioids are a group of chemical substances, naturally occurring and synthetic, that bind at the opiate receptor. Opiates are a group of naturally occurring compounds derived from the poppy, Papaver somniferum. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is common, particularly in patients with chronic opioid abuse, and often life threatening (especially a heroin or methadone overdose). OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting and miosis. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE POISONING: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia.  Acute tubular necrosis secondary to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria may develop in patients with prolonged coma or seizures. Death may result from any of these complications.  Scleroderma following heroin abuse has been reported and may be linked to talc mixed with heroin.  Wound botulism resulting in flaccid paralysis may occur following black tar heroin abuse.  Hypoglycemia and leukocytosis have been reported in heroin abusers. DESOMORPHINE: Severe tissue damage, phlebitis, gangrene, and limb ischemia leading to amputation, and death have been reported following IV or IM injections of \"Crocodile\" (also known as Krokodil or Russian heroin), a Russian slang term for homemade desomorphine.  <br\/>"},{"id":"923849-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OPIOIDS\/OPIOID ANTAGONIST <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Opioid overdoses are life threatening. Activated charcoal should be considered early after a significant oral ingestion, if a patient can protect their airway and is without significant signs of toxicity. If a patient is displaying signs of moderate to severe toxicity, do NOT administer activated charcoal because of the risk of aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed, but may be necessary in overdoses of high potency opioids, like fentanyl. A CONTINUOUS infusion may be necessary in patients that have ingested a long-acting opioid. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1-2 hours. Many opioids have a much longer duration of effect, so it may be necessary to observe the patient at least 3-4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia or due to properties of certain agents (e.g., meperidine, tramadol, propoxyphene). Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Opioid plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy; urine toxicology immunoassays may also miss synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl and methadone). Obtain a baseline acetaminophen and salicylate levels in a patient with a suspected overdose. Routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of opioid toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value because of the large volume of distribution for opioids.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Limited experience. Treat seizures (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol) and support blood pressure with fluids and pressors as needed. Naloxone infusion may be useful. Intubate and ventilate as needed. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage may accelerate recovery.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions and all children with ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for observation for at least 4 hours, as peak plasma levels and symptoms will likely develop within this time period. Patients that have ingested a sustained release or long acting product have the potential to manifest symptoms in a delayed fashion and should be observed for 24 hours. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous depression should be admitted to the hospital. Patients needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as they may have taken a longer-acting opioid and may need additional doses. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, or delirium or those needing a naloxone infusion or intubated patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923849-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>OPIOIDS\/OPIOID ANTAGONIST<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxicity of an opioid varies with the agent, as well as with tolerance developed from habitual use.
