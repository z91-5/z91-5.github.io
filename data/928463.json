It is also used for the treatment of chronic iron overload in adults and children 10 years or older with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia syndromes who have liver iron concentrations of at least 5 mg iron\/g dry weight and serum ferritin levels greater than 300 mcg\/L. PHARMACOLOGY: Deferasirox, a tridentate ligand, is an orally active chelating agent that is selective for iron (Fe(3+)) with a high affinity binding ratio of 2:1. It has very low affinity for zinc and copper, although variable decreases in serum concentrations of zinc and copper have been observed after administration of deferasirox. At 10, 20, and 40 mg\/kg\/day, deferasirox induces a mean net iron excretion of 0.119, 0.329, and 0.445 mg Fe\/kg body weight\/day, respectively. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are anticipated to be similar to excessive pharmacologic adverse events. Hepatitis was reported in one patient who received 2 to 3 times the prescribed dose of deferasirox over a period of several weeks. In iron overloaded beta-thalassemic patients, single doses up to 80 mg\/kg have been tolerated with nausea and diarrhea noted. Single doses up to 40 mg\/kg were tolerated in healthy volunteers. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects reported with the use of deferasirox included the following: increased serum creatinine, proteinuria, acute renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, drug-induced hepatitis, agranulocytosis, neutropenia, worsening anemia, thrombocytopenia, rash, urticaria, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fever, back and joint pain, headache, and fatigue. <br\/>"},{"id":"928463-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DEFERASIROX<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
