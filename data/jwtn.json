Myelosuppression is common, tumor lysis syndrome may cause renal failure. Rashes are common. CARMUSTINE: Hypotension, tachycardia and myocardial ischemia have been reported with high dose carmustine infusion. Thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia are common. Pulmonary toxicity may develop after carmustine therapy and may be dose related. Effects are more commonly reported in women and may present years after therapy. LOMUSTINE: Delayed myelosuppression is the most common and severe toxic effect. Pulmonary fibrosis has developed. Acute renal insufficiency and failure can develop. Nausea and vomiting are common.

Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free NS or LR). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative-free NS or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours).
