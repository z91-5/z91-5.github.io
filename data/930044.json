JAK1 and JAK2 recruit signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) to cytokine receptors leading to modulation of gene expression. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Toxicity following overdose has not been reported.  Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses and may include anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse effects (greater than 10%) are bruising, dizziness, headache, elevated hepatic enzyme concentrations, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. LESS FREQUENT: Other adverse effects that have occurred less frequently include urinary tract infections, elevated serum cholesterol, weight gain, and flatulence. WITHDRAWAL: A severe withdrawal syndrome, including acute relapse of disease symptoms (splenomegaly, pruritus, fever, fatigue), respiratory distress associated with pleural and\/or pericardial effusion and pulmonary edema, coagulopathy, and a septic shock-like syndrome (severe hypoxia, hypotension, fever, and confusion), have been reported after discontinuation of ruxolitinib treatment.<br\/>"},{"id":"930044-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RUXOLITINIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Myelosuppression has been reported with therapeutic doses. Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelets. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients who are awake and able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain their airway or if the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Severe neutropenia: filgrastim 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or SubQ or sargramostim 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV infused over 4 hours. Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelets. Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor CBC with differential and platelets. Monitor liver enzymes after significant overdose. Serum ruxolitinib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice. Monitor for evidence of withdrawal (fever, shortness of breath, anemia, rapidly increasing splenomegaly). It is not known if this syndrome can develop after acute overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (97%).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of one or two extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe neutropenia should be admitted to the hospital. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with a medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930044-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>RUXOLITINIB<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
