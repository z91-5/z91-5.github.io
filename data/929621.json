PHARMACOLOGY: Naproxen is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), leading to decreased synthesis of prostanoids. Naproxen, like other NSAIDs, has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. TOXICOLOGY: Prostaglandin inhibition is responsible for the gastrointestinal irritant effects and nephrotoxicity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning with NSAIDs is not uncommon but rarely severe. Naproxen overdose is uncommon in the United States since other NSAIDs are used more often. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Gastrointestinal effects (eg, dyspepsia, ulceration, bleeding) are most commonly encountered. Renal dysfunction, most often in elderly patients, may occur. Mild CNS effects include altered cognition, drowsiness, headache, and mood changes, especially in the elderly population. SEVERE POISONING: Severe poisoning is rare but can include CNS depression, hallucinations, seizures, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and metabolic acidosis. ADVERSE EFFECTS: CNS effects include drowsiness, headache, fatigue, and cognition disturbances, especially in the elderly. Gastrointestinal effects (eg, dyspepsia, ulceration, bleeding) are as common as with other NSAIDs. Renal dysfunction, especially in the elderly population, may be seen. Instances of agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and pancreatitis have been reported. Hepatotoxicity is rare.<br\/><\/li><li><b>OMEPRAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole are substituted benzimidazoles and potent proton-pump inhibitors used as gastric antisecretories.  They are used to treat various gastrointestinal conditions (eg, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), duodenal and peptic ulcers, and esophageal stricture).  Esomeprazole with naproxen and omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate combinations are also available. Refer to &quot;NAPROXEN&quot; and &quot;SODIUM BICARBONATE&quot; management for specific information. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents inhibit the parietal cell membrane enzyme (H+\/K+)-ATPase, typically referred to as the proton pump, which blocks the final step of acid production. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare, and only mild toxicity has been reported. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. In limited overdose cases, clinical effects have consisted of mild tachycardia, flushing, somnolence, confusion, headache, blurred vision, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, and moderate leukocytosis. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Proton-pump inhibitors have similar adverse events reported after therapeutic use. COMMON (2% or greater): Headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and flatulence. OTHER EFFECTS: Constipation, dry mouth, hypertension, and dizziness. RARE: Lichen spinulosus, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticaria, anaphylaxis, hypomagnesemia, pancreatitis, elevated serum creatinine levels, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, optic atrophy, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, hypocalcemic-induced seizures. ACUTE INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS: Although rare, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been reported in association with all proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).  The mean duration of treatment prior to onset of symptoms is reported at 9 to 13 weeks.  A decline in renal function is usually noted over a period of days to weeks. Fatigue, malaise, weakness, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss are commonly reported symptoms.  Classic drug hypersensitivity signs and symptoms, such as the clinical triad of rash, fever and eosinophilia, are seen in less than 10% of patients.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929621-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>NAPROXEN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Primarily supportive care; activated charcoal may not be necessary given the fast gastrointestinal absorption of the drug and anticipated mild toxicity.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: If significant CNS depression occurs, consider orotracheal intubation for airway protection before giving charcoal. Give benzodiazepines for anxiety, agitation, delirium, and seizures. Be aware of the risk of renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of potential for somnolence and seizures.

HOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is not expected after an overdose. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. Consider activated charcoal only if coingestants with significant toxicity are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor vital signs, CBC with differential, renal function, CK, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution of these agents.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929621-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>NAPROXEN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Severe toxicity developed in an adolescent who ingested 13.75 g and in an adult who ingested 90 g of naproxen.
