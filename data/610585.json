Possible sequelae include acute reversible renal failure.  FLUPENTHIXOL or THIOTHIXENE - Acute intoxication may cause extrapyramidal movements, somnolence, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias, and tardive dyskinesia.  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and mania has been reported with chronic therapeutic use and may occur in overdose.
