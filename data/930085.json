The active moiety, azilsartan, is an angiotensin II antagonist that selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptors. By blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptors, azilsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and therefore promotes vasodilation and decreased aldosterone effects. Azilsartan displays greater than 10,000-fold affinity for AT1 receptor, compared with binding to AT2 receptor, and has not shown affinity to any other receptors or ion channels of cardiac significance. The breakdown of bradykinin appears unaffected by azilsartan.<\/li><li>Chlorthalidone is a diuretic that increases excretion of sodium and chloride at the ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the nephron, resulting in decreased extracellular fluid volume, plasma volume, cardiac output, total exchangeable sodium, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930085-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"930085-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Azilsartan, Tmax, Oral: 3 hours<\/li><li>Chlorthalidone, Tmax, Oral: 1 hour<\/li><li>Azilsartan, Bioavailability, Oral: 60%<\/li><li>Effect of food: no effect on bioavailability<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930085-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Azilsartan, Protein binding, Albumin: greater than 99%<\/li><li>Chlorthalidone, Protein binding: 75%; Albumin: 58%<\/li><li>Azilsartan, Vd: 16 L<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930085-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Azilsartan, Liver via CYP2C9 <br\/>"},{"id":"930085-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Azilsartan, Renal clearance: 2.3 mL\/min<\/li><li>Azilsartan, Renal excretion: 42%, 15% unchanged<\/li><li>Chlorthalidone, Renal excretion: major route, unchanged<\/li><li>Azilsartan, Fecal: 55%<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930085-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Azilsartan, 12 hours<\/li><li>Chlorthalidone, 45 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}]},{"id":"930085-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>take with or without food<\/li><li>correct volume depletion prior to administration<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930085-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>Reduced blood pressure may indicate efficacy.<\/li><li>Renal function; particularly in patients with renal impairment<\/li><li>Serum electrolytes; periodically<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930085-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Edarbyclor<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: (Azilsartan Medoxomil - Chlorthalidone) 40 MG-12.5 MG, 40 MG-25 MG<br\/>"},{"id":"930085-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"930085-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/>USES: Class of drugs that are primarily used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Potassium sparing diuretics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Work in a variety of mechanisms including inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (thiazides), inhibiting transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle (loop), and osmotic agents (mannitol). TOXICOLOGY: Produce hypovolemia and electrolyte deficiencies. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Rare overdose which uncommonly results in significant morbidity or death. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild dehydration, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, headache, muscle cramps, thirst, and brisk diuresis. Large doses of furosemide or ethacrynic acid can cause ototoxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, mental status changes, and electrolyte abnormalities (i.e. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia) are the most common manifestations of severe poisoning. Rarely muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, coma, or dysrhythmias may develop secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities.  CNS depression has been reported rarely in children with acute ingestion without significant electrolyte abnormalities. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Thiazides are associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Furosemide has been associated with ototoxicity, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  Diuretics have a large number of drug interactions as well. Extravasation of mannitol can cause tissue injury and compartment syndrome.<br\/>"},{"id":"930085-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients with minor symptoms can be managed with supportive care only.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Adults with intentional ingestions or symptomatic children should be referred to a health care facility.  Patients who are asymptomatic after 6 hours can be discharged home. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have severe electrolyte abnormalities or vital sign abnormalities should be admitted.
