It has also been used for other cancers, such as cervical, breast, colorectal, or head and neck cancers. Mitomycin ophthalmic topical solution is indicated as an adjunct to ab externa glaucoma surgery. PHARMACOLOGY: Mitomycin ophthalmic solution is isolated from Streptomyces verticillus Yingtangensis and mitomycin solution for injection is isolated from Streptomyces caespitosus. Mitomycin is an antibiotic with antimetabolite activity. It causes cross-linking of DNA and inhibits DNA synthesis. It may also inhibit cellular RNA and protein synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Limited data are available on mitomycin overdose.  The clinical effects reported are those noted during therapeutic use of mitomycin, including high-dose therapy. ADVERSE EFFECTS: INTRAVENOUS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, mucositis, fever, and myelosuppression (eg, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia). Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may occur anytime within 8 weeks after onset of therapy with an average time of 4 weeks. Recovery after cessation of therapy was within 10 weeks. Approximately 25% of leukopenia or thrombocytopenic episodes did not recover. OTHER EFFECTS: Alopecia, diarrhea, ileus, confusion, drowsiness, fatigue, lethargy, headache, syncope, weakness, skin findings (eg, extravasation, desquamation, induration, pruritus, pain on injection, paresthesias, contact dermatitis, necrosis, cellulitis, ulceration, and tissue sloughing at the injection site), renal dysfunction, thrombophlebitis, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity (eg, hemoptysis, dyspnea, cough, pneumonitis, alveolitis, and pulmonary fibrosis). Hemolytic uremic syndrome, consisting mainly of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (hematocrit equal to or less than 25%), thrombocytopenia (equal to or less than 100,000\/mm(3)), and irreversible renal failure (serum creatinine equal to or greater than 1.6 mg\/dL) has been reported in patients receiving systemic mitomycin. Approximately 98% of patients with this syndrome developed microangiopathic hemolysis with fragmented red blood cells on peripheral blood smears. Congestive heart failure has rarely been reported in patients receiving mitomycin. Almost all patients with CHF had previously received doxorubicin. OPHTHALMIC: Chronic bleb leak, hypotony, hypotony maculopathy, blebitis, endophthalmitis, lenticular changes, cataract formation, corneal reactions (eg, endothelial damage, epithelial defects, anterior synechiae, superficial punctuate keratitis), and vascular reactions (eg, hyphema, central retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemorrhage) have been reported.<br\/>"},{"id":"379200-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MITOMYCIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. <\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics.  Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free normal saline or lactated ringers).  For large overdoses, consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative-free normal saline or lactated ringers through the ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter.  Typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours).  Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe respiratory symptoms, cardiotoxicity, or acute allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. For example: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with a mitomycin overdose in whom neutropenia and mucositis would be anticipated, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Mitomycin, a vesicant, can produce cellulitis, ulceration, and tissue sloughing at the mitomycin extravasation. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Administer dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO - see dosing below). Elevate the affected area. Apply ice packs for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily. Do not apply excessive cold to avoid tissue injury. Cold can cause local vasoconstriction and reduces fluid absorption. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable).  Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy. DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE (DMSO): Treat site with topical DMSO (for a minimum of 7 days and maximum of 14 days); however, if blistering develops, discontinue DMSO and review site. Another source recommended DMSO 99% solution topically and allow to air dry. Cover with a nonocclusive dressing within 10 to 25 min. Repeat every 8 hours for 1 week.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes. Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Myelosuppression has been reported. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may occur anytime within 8 weeks after onset of therapy with an average time of 4 weeks. Recovery after cessation of therapy was within 10 weeks. About 25% of leukopenia or thrombocytopenic episodes did not recover. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Clinically evaluate patients for the development of mucositis. Monitor injection site for signs of extravasation. Monitor patients closely for the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. All overdoses should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Exposed patients should be evaluated and observed for 6 hours. If patients are asymptomatic for 6 hours, they may be sent home, but toxic effects may be delayed, so patients should return to a healthcare provider for any symptoms and should have blood work monitored as an outpatient (eg, CBC for myelosuppression). ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any symptomatic patient should be admitted to the hospital, and depending on the severity of their symptoms, either to the floor or ICU. Criteria for discharge should be resolution of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with an overdose. Consult a nephrologist if hemolytic uremic syndrome develops. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe myelosuppression may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"379200-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MITOMYCIN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: An adult received 70 mg and recovered with supportive care.
