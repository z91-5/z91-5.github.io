PHARMACOLOGY: Fibrates activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alfa (PPARa), leading to elimination of triglyceride-rich particles, transformation, and increased elimination of small, dense LDL particles and synthesis of apolipoproteins AI, AII, and HDL-C. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: The extent of symptoms in human overdose is unknown. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Headache, back pain, nasopharyngitis, nausea, myalgia, diarrhea, and upper respiratory tract infection. Increases of serum transaminase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal were reported following fenofibrate therapy. LESS COMMON: Fatigue, increased ALT, and muscle spasms.<br\/><\/li><li><b>LOVASTATIN AND RELATED DRUGS <\/b><br\/>USES: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The following agents are available in the United States: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. Atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin are also available in combination with other agents (atorvastatin\/amlodipine; lovastatin\/niacin; pravastatin\/aspirin; simvastatin\/ezetimibe; simvastatin\/niacin; simvastatin\/sitagliptin). PHARMACOLOGY: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, preventing conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate determining enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Ingestion of up to 6 grams of lovastatin has been reported without specific effects or sequelae. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not expected, unless a coingestant is present. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain, myopathy, myalgias, rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, dermatitis, diplopia, blepharoptosis (ptosis), ophthalmoplegia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have been reported in patients receiving statins. Other reported adverse effects (rare) include hyperkalemia (lovastatin), photosensitivity (simvastatin), dermatomyositis (simvastatin and pravastatin), limb compartment syndrome (simvastatin and atorvastatin), acute renal failure (lovastatin), pancreatitis (pravastatin and lovastatin\/gemfibrozil), chest pain (pravastatin), atrial fibrillation (simvastatin), vasculitis (atorvastatin), hemolytic anemia (lovastatin), thrombocytopenic purpura (atorvastatin), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (simvastatin), akathisia (lovastatin), extrapyramidal effects (lovastatin), nasopharyngitis (atorvastatin), upper respiratory infection (pravastatin), cough (pravastatin), lung fibrosis (simvastatin), peripheral neuropathy (lovastatin and simvastatin).<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jy7ps12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>FENOFIBRATE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
