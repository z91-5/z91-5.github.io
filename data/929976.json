These retinal abnormalities exhibited fundoscopic features similar to those of retinal pigment dystrophies. The reversibility and rate of progression of these retinal abnormalities is unknown. Accordingly, ezogabine is only indicated for patients who have experienced refractory results with other treatments and in whom the benefits of ezogabine exceed the risk of vision loss. Visual monitoring (including visual acuity, dilated fundus photography, and possibly fluorescein angiograms, ocular coherence tomography, perimetry, and electroretinograms) is indicated at baseline and at 6-month intervals thereafter with ezogabine therapy. Discontinue use if retinal pigmentary abnormalities or vision changes are detected and no other treatment options are available and in patients who do not gain substantial clinical benefit after adequate ezogabine titration. <br\/>"},{"id":"929976-s-3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"929976-s-3-9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"specific contraindications have not been determined <br\/>"},{"id":"929976-s-3-10","title":"Precautions","mono":"<ul><li>retinal abnormalities (ie, pigment changes, retinal dystrophy) have occurred with long-term use;

PHARMACOLOGY: Ezogabine is an anticonvulsant that enhances transmembrane potassium currents mediated by the KCNQ (Kv7.2 to 7.5) family of ion channels. By activating and opening these KCNQ channels, ezogabine helps stabilize the resting membrane potential and reduce brain excitability. In vitro studies also suggest that ezogabine augments GABA-mediated currents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Agitation, aggressiveness, and irritability were reported during clinical trials with total daily doses greater than 2500 mg. SEVERE TOXICITY: Cardiac dysrhythmias (asystole or ventricular tachycardia) occurred in 2 volunteers within 3 hours of ingesting a single 900-mg ezogabine dose. Both individuals recovered, without sequelae, following spontaneous resolution of the dysrhythmias. Ezogabine prolongs the QT interval, Torsades de Pointes is possible but has not been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, confusion, vertigo, tremor, abnormal coordination, diplopia, memory impairment, asthenia, blurred vision, gait disturbance, aphasia, dysarthria, and balance disorder. INFREQUENT: Other adverse effects that have occurred less frequently include: QT interval prolongation, dysuria, urinary retention, nausea, constipation, hallucinations, and anxiety.<br\/>"},{"id":"929976-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>EZOGABINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients require only supportive care. Control agitation and confusion with benzodiazepines. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat agitation with benzodiazepines. Therapeutic doses of ezogabine may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of ezogabine and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsade de pointes. Treat torsade de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities, overdrive pacing may be necessary. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias using ACLS protocols.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion of ezogabine, if the patient is awake and able to maintain their airway or if airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may rarely be required in patients with significant CNS depression or dysrhythmias.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Therapeutic doses of ezogabine may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of ezogabine and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsade de pointes. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, atrial overdrive pacing may be necessary.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULT: 1 to 2 g IV (mixed in 50 to 100 mL D5W) infused over 5 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILD: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Rates of 100 to 120 beats\/min may terminate torsades. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine laboratory studies are not likely to be necessary. Monitor neurologic status s. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor urine output for evidence of urinary retention. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children (other than mild drowsiness) with a minor (50 mg or less) inadvertent ingestion may be monitored at home with appropriate adult supervision. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic or have persistent ECG abnormalities despite adequate treatment should be admitted. Patients with dysrhythmias should be admitted to an ICU setting.
