the microtubule disrupting agent MMAE; and a protease-cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10. The anticancer activity of brentuximab vedotin is presumed to be due to the binding of the ADC to CD30-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-CD30 complex and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. The microtubule disrupting agent MMAE binds to tubulin, disrupting the microtubule network which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of the cells.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jxlds8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"jxlds8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"MMAE, Tmax: 1 to 3 days <br\/>"},{"id":"jxlds8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC), Vd: 6 to 10 L<\/li><li>MMAE (the microtubule disrupting agent cleaved from brentuximab vedotin), Protein binding, 68% to 82%<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxlds8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"MMAE (the microtubule disrupting agent cleaved from brentuximab vedotin), hepatic: limited via CYP3A4\/5 <br\/>"},{"id":"jxlds8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>MMAE (the microtubule disrupting agent cleaved from brentuximab vedotin), Renal excretion: up to 24%<\/li><li>MMAE (the microtubule disrupting agent cleaved from brentuximab vedotin), Feces: 72%, predominantly unchanged<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxlds8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC), 4 to 6 days <br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"jxlds9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>Use proper procedures for handling and disposal of chemotherapy<br\/><\/li><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Reconstitute each 50-mg vial with 10.5 mL of sterile water for injection for a concentration of 5 mg\/mL; gently swirl, do not shake or freeze<\/li><li>Dilute in at least 100 mL of NS, D5W, or LR immediately or within 24 hours of reconstitution for final concentration of 0.4 mg\/mL to 1.8 mg\/mL<\/li><li>Store reconstituted vials or diluted solution at 2 to 8 degrees C (36 to 46 degrees F) and use within 24 hours<\/li><li>Administer IV over 30 minutes<\/li><li>Do not mix or infuse with other medications<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jxlds10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>Clinical and radiologic evidence of tumor response indicates efficacy<\/li><li>CBC prior to each dose or more frequently for patients with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia; include differential<\/li><li>Liver enzymes and bilirubin<\/li><li>Peripheral neuropathy (motor or sensory); eg, hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness<\/li><li>Infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis<\/li><li>Fever<\/li><li>Emergence of bacterial, fungal, or viral infections during treatment<\/li><li>Signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome, especially in patients with highly proliferative tumors or high tumor burden prior to treatment<\/li><li>Signs and symptoms of CNS system abnormalities that indicate progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jxlds11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Adcetris<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 50 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"jxlds13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Tell patient to report symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (rare).<\/li><li>Advise patient to report symptoms of an infusion reaction or infection.<\/li><li>Side effects may include fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, pyrexia, or rash.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report symptoms of hepatotoxicity.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report symptoms of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
