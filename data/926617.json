encapsulated in lipid microspheres. When given intravenously, the acoustic properties of the octafluoropropane-filled lipid microspheres enable improved left-ventricular cavity enhancement and delineation of endocardial borders during echocardiography. The acoustic impedance of perflutren is lower than that of blood, which is associated with enhancement of the intrinsic backscatter of blood; this can be visualized as a brighter blood pool compared to darker myocardium.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"926617-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"926617-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Protein binding: minimal <br\/>"},"2":{"id":"926617-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Hepatic: speculated <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"926617-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Lungs <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"926617-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"1.3 minutes <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"926617-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>prior to administration, activate by shaking for a full 45 seconds in an apparatus (Vialmix(R)) provided by the manufacturer<\/li><li>activated perflutren in lipid microspheres is a milky white suspension and may be used immediately after activation<\/li><li>resuspend the product by 10 seconds of hand agitation (through inverting the vial prior to product withdrawal from the vial) if not used within 5 minutes of activation<\/li><li>activated perflutren in lipid microspheres can be used for up to 12 hours from time of Vialmix(R), but only after the microspheres are resuspended by hand agitation<\/li><li>do not inject air into the vial<\/li><li>withdraw product from the middle of the vial with the Intellipin(R) dispensing pin or with a 18- or 20- gauge syringe needle<\/li><li>use product immediately upon withdrawal from vial; do not let the product stand in the syringe<\/li><li>vials are for SINGLE-USE ONLY as they contain no bacterial preservative.<\/li><li>bolus injection, use a 18- to 20-gauge needle via forearm vein. <\/li><li>continuous infusion, 1.3 mL activated perflutren should be diluted in 50 mL preservative-free saline; initiate infuse at 4 mL\/min, titrate as needed not to exceed 10 mL\/min.<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"926617-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>high quality left-ventricular contrast opacification and delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>acute cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock, symptomatic arrhythmias, and convulsions; generally occur within 30 minutes of administration; may be more likely to occur in those with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"926617-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Drug may cause headache, back and renal pain, flushing, and nausea.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of arrhythmia, tachycardia, hypotension, or cardiac or respiratory arrest.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
