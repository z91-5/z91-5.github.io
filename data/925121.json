Thyroid retention of radioiodide permits quantification of organ uptake and imaging of anatomical distribution in thyroid tissue. Sodium iodide I 123 is also concentrated in functioning papillary, follicular, or mixed papillary\/follicular thyroid cancer and metastases, although to a lesser extent than in normal thyroid tissue. . In the absence of unusually high or low iodine intake or medications that influence the accumulation of iodine in the thyroid gland, thyroid function may be measured by the fraction of the administered sodium iodide I 123 that is accumulated in the thyroid gland.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"925121-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"925121-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Oral: readily absorbed <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"925121-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Protein binding: (oral) none <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"925121-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 50% to 75%<\/li><li>Fecal: &lt;2%<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"925121-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Euthyroid: 80 d<\/li><li>Hyperthyroid: 5 to 40 d<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"925121-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>dispense and preserve capsules in well-closed containers that are adequately shielded<\/li><li>capsules can be utilized up to 30 hours after calibration time and date; discard after this time with standard safety procedures<\/li><li>waterproof gloves should be worn at all times when handling capsules or container<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
