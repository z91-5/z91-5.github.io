GHB and other substances that are metabolized to GHB are used as drugs of abuse. Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) (marketed under varius brand names), a precursor in the synthesis of GHB, and an alleged herbal &quot;growth hormone stimulaor&quot;, produces an intoxication similar to GHB. PHARMACOLOGY: GHB is a structural analog of the neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) with agonist activity at both GABA (B) and GHB receptors.  It is rapidly absorbed and has a rapid onset of action. TOXICOLOGY: GHB is believed to be a neuromodulator in the CNS where high affinity to specific GHB receptor occurs. It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, resulting in general anesthesia and respiratory depression. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Illicit use of GHB and its related compounds is fairly common in some areas of the US and may occur in several settings: in the recreational setting of raves and night clubs; in the athletic setting of bodybuilding gyms and fitness centers (used because it is alleged to stimulate growth hormone release); in the home consumer setting of individuals seeking its &quot;natural health benefit,&quot; and in the criminal setting of drug-facilitated sexual assault. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Following doses of 30 mg\/kg, hallucination, abrupt onset of sleep, enuresis, myoclonic movements, and euphoria will occur, which start about 15 minutes after ingestion; delirium and agitation are also common. Vomiting is seen in 30% to 50% of patients. SEVERE TOXICITY: Commonly present with bradycardia, myoclonic movements, unconsciousness, delirium, and coma, which occur about 30 to 40 minutes after oral overdose and recover within 2 to 4 hours with complete resolution of symptoms within 8 hours. Hypothermia and mild acidosis may also develop. Seizures have been reported, but are rare. Cheyne-Stokes respiration and loss of proactive reflexes occur. Severe alkaline corrosive burn of the gastrointestinal tract may occur following ingestion of improperly prepared illicit GHB, but is rare. ONSET: Rapid after IV injection (within 2 to 15 minutes) and oral ingestion (within 15 to 30 minutes).  Concurrent alcohol ingestion may delay onset of symptoms from 1,4-BD, due to competition with alcohol dehydrogenase for metabolism to GHB. DURATION: Coma typically lasts 1 to 2 hours, with full recovery by 8 hours; dizziness may linger for up to 2 weeks. Acute symptoms have resolved within 8 hours after doses of 1\/4 teaspoon to 4 tablespoons. Concurrent alcohol ingestion may prolong the duration of effect from 1,4-BD. WITHDRAWAL: A withdrawal syndrome similar to ethanol\/sedative\/hypnotic withdrawal has been reported in patients after abrupt cessation of long-term, frequent  (multiple times daily) use. ADVERSE EFFECT: Nausea, headache, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, somnolence, vomiting, and urinary incontinence are the most commonly observed adverse events following therapeutic doses of sodium oxybate. Refer to the GHB-WITHDRAWAL management for further information.<br\/><\/li><li><b>GHB-WITHDRAWAL<\/b><br\/>BACKGROUND: Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its analogs including gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) and gamma-valerolactone (GVL) are common drugs of abuse. There is increasing evidence that chronic, frequent (multiple times daily) abuse can lead to physical tolerance. In these patients, abrupt abstinence can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome. Please refer to the GAMMA HYDROXYBUTYRATE AND RELATED AGENTS management for information regarding acute exposure to GHB and related substances. TOXICOLOGY: GHB is thought to function as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS at GABA-B receptors. GHB temporarily suppresses dopamine release, followed by a release of endogenous opioids and a surge in dopamine release, especially in neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Chronic, frequent GHB abuse is thought to be due to decreased endogenous GABAergic tone in the CNS leading to withdrawal when chronic use is abruptly stopped. Withdrawal symptoms are similar to those seen with ethanol withdrawal, as well as with other sedative-hypnotic withdrawal syndromes. EPIDEMIOLOGY: GHB withdrawal is not common and is generally only seen in patients with escalating daily use (up to every 2 hours) over a period of months to years. Rarely, withdrawal has occurred following brief exposure (ie, 1 to 2 weeks). MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Abrupt abstinence after frequent chronic use may produce a range of effects with symptoms similar to those seen with other sedative-hypnotic agent withdrawal syndromes and ethanol withdrawal syndrome. Mild to moderate effects include anxiety, tremor, insomnia, disorientation and nystagmus. GI effects including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe symptoms of GHB withdrawal include autonomic instability similar to that seen with ethanol withdrawal, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia. Severe neuropsychiatric effects include severe anxiety, agitation, paranoia, tremor and visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations. Rarely, rhabdomyolysis and seizures may be seen; seizures are less common with GHB withdrawal than with ethanol withdrawal.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924076-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>GAMMA HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Most patients will not require airway management, but require monitoring and positioning such that if they vomit they do not aspirate. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines and barbiturates. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Protect the airway and assist ventilation, if needed. Note that patients who required intubation are often awake and extubated within a few hours.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Do not give charcoal or induce vomiting because of the risk of rapid loss of consciousness and loss of airway protective reflexes, which may lead to pulmonary aspiration. HOSPITAL: The small amount of GHB usually ingested is rapidly absorbed, so gastric lavage, and activated charcoal are of doubtful benefit and not recommended.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation should be considered in any patient with an unprotected airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote. Flumazenil and naloxone are not clinically effective.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, mental status, and the ability to protect the airway. Serum glucose, electrolytes, pulse oximetry, and ECG should be obtained as a part of the general assessment of the patient. Serum levels are not routinely available or useful in patient management.  A serum concentration greater than 50 mg\/L is associated with loss of consciousness, and a concentration greater than 260 mg\/L produces unresponsive coma. The duration of the detection of GHB in the blood and the urine is short (6 and 12 hours, respectively, after therapeutic doses).<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for enhanced removal procedures such as dialysis and hemoperfusion.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Because symptoms typically resolve within few hours, stable patients can be discharged within 4 to 8 hours.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>GHB-WITHDRAWAL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: GHB withdrawal consists of predominantly symptomatic and supportive care. Anxiety and insomnia may be treated with benzodiazepines as needed. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment for severe toxicity begins with symptomatic and supportive care. Agitation, tachycardia, and hypertension typically respond to treatment with other GABA agonists as needed. Benzodiazepines are considered to be the first-line treatment, although very high doses may be required. Patients who are refractory to treatment with benzodiazepines may require treatment with barbiturates or propofol. Pharmaceutical preparations of GHB have been used to treat resistant withdrawal. Antipsychotics such as droperidol and haloperidol may be considered as adjuncts to treatment, especially in patients where neuropsychiatric symptoms and hallucinations predominate. These preparations should be used with caution as they lower the seizure threshold. Patients with hyperthermia and severe agitation may require intubation, sedation, and external cooling, as well as aggressive IV fluid hydration to treat rhabdomyolysis. Seizures are rare. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines as needed.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: There is no role for decontamination in GHB withdrawal. HOSPITAL: There is no role for decontamination in GHB withdrawal.<\/li><li>Airway management: Rarely, patients with severe agitation and autonomic instability may require intubation due to the high doses of sedation required.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for GHB withdrawal, although symptoms typically resolve if GHB is restarted. In the healthcare setting, symptoms are typically treated with other GABA agonists such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol. Pharmaceutical GHB has also been used to treat resistant withdrawal.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: GHB levels are not easily available in most labs, and are not clinically relevant to the management of GHB withdrawal. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Serum electrolytes, renal function, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase should be evaluated in patients with evidence of toxicity. Patients with toxicity should receive an ECG and cardiac monitoring.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for enhanced elimination in the treatment of GHB withdrawal.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management of GHB withdrawal. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with GHB withdrawal should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Because of the duration of withdrawal symptoms, patients whose symptoms are controlled with ED treatment will need to either be referred to a drug treatment program that can provide tapered benzodiazepine therapy, or provided with tapered benzodiazepine doses that can be carefully supervised in an outpatient setting. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop significant symptoms with tachycardia, hypertension, and severe agitation who require more than a small amount of benzodiazepines for treatment should be admitted to the hospital, especially given the typical duration of withdrawal symptoms lasting several days. Patients with significant autonomic instability including hyperthermia, patients requiring intubation, patients with seizure activity, and patients with severe and refractory symptoms should be admitted to an ICU setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact your regional poison center for a toxicology consult for any patient with suspected GHB withdrawal and more than mild symptoms.
