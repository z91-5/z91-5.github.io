treat all forms of tuberculosis. The initial phase of therapy consists of a 3-drug regimen that includes rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide that is administered for 2 months, followed by maintenance therapy with rifampin and isoniazid for at least 4 months. PHARMACOLOGY: Rifampin, a semisynthetic macrocyclic antibiotic derivative of rifamycin SV (derived from Streptomyces mediterranei), inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. It can interact with bacterial RNA polymerase. Disruption of RNA synthesis interrupts protein synthesis, leading to cell death. However, it does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. TOXICOLOGY: The mechanism of toxicity for rifamycin derivatives remains unknown. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Fatalities have occurred in both adults and children; the minimum lethal dose appears to be highly variable and may depend on underlying comorbidities (ie, hepatic insufficiency). MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients are likely to present with nausea and vomiting; the vomitus may appear orange to red in color. Other symptoms include: abdominal pain, pruritus, headache, and increasing lethargy. Brownish-red or orange discoloration of the skin and bodily fluids (ie, urine, sweat, saliva, tears, and feces) can develop quickly following overdose; the degree of discoloration appears to be dose-dependent. Transient alterations in liver enzymes and bilirubin levels may be observed. Facial and\/or periorbital edema have been observed in some adults and children following overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hepatotoxicity (ie, liver enlargement, tenderness, elevated  liver enzyme and bilirubin concentrations) can develop after a severe overdose. Symptoms may be more severe in patients with a history of impaired liver function. Jaundice may develop soon after severe exposure. A large ingestion can rarely result in seizures, hypotension, dysrhythmias, pulmonary edema, cardia arrest and death. ADVERSE EVENTS: Nausea, vomiting, jaundice, diarrhea, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, mental confusion and mild, self-limited cutaneous reactions (flushing and itching with or without a rash) have been observed with therapy. Other events may include: flushing and itching of the skin with or without a rash (typically not a hypersensitivity reaction), visual disturbances, fever, muscular weakness, pain in extremities, and generalized numbness. Laboratory findings may demonstrate transient abnormalities in liver function tests (eg, elevated serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases), leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and decreased hemoglobin, and elevations in BUN and serum uric acid. INFREQUENT: Thrombocytopenia has been observed in patients receiving intermittent high-dose therapy. RARE: Agranulocytosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, hematuria, acute renal failure, psychoses, anaphylaxis have been reported rarely with therapy. CHRONIC USE: Hepatitis and jaundice may be noted following chronic therapeutic administration of rifamycin antibiotics and is most notable in patients with chronic liver disease, alcoholism, and old age. <br\/>"},{"id":"516417-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RIFAMPIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea) should be anticipated. Administer IV fluids in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Antiemetics may be necessary to control severe nausea and vomiting. Monitor vital signs and assess liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Monitor neuro function; lethargy is an early finding. Reversible brownish-red or orange discoloration of the skin and bodily fluids is likely to occur and is dose-dependent. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Alterations in mental status may develop; symptoms may be significant in patients with underlying hepatic disease. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin levels until evidence of patient recovery. There have been rare reports of conduction abnormalities, hypotension, seizures and pulmonary edema following severe toxicity. Monitor vital signs, neuro status, obtain a baseline ECG and institute cardiac monitoring. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines, barbiturates as necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital GI decontamination is not recommended due to the potential for CNS depression. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal, if the ingestion is relatively recent and the patient is alert and able to protect their airway. Repeat administration of activated charcoal may be beneficial since rifamycin antibiotics undergo enterohepatic circulation. However, there are no clinical trials documenting the efficacy of this procedure. Gastric lavage may also be indicated following a significant recent (first 2 to 3 hours) ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary following mild to moderate toxicity. However, patients with severe toxicity may develop significant alterations in mental status, or other symptoms that may require intubation.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, hepatic enzymes, serum bilirubin concentration and INR in symptomatic patients; monitor until patient recovery. Obtain a baseline CBC following a significant overdose. Obtain a baseline ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with evidence of conduction abnormalities. Plasma rifampin levels may be useful to confirm overdoses, but are not readily available and are not useful in guiding therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Extracorporeal procedures are unlikely to be beneficial following overdose based on its protein binding and extensive volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic (other than mild nausea) child or adult with an inadvertent minor (1 or 2 pills) exposure may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children or adults who are symptomatic after inadvertent exposure should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Patients may be discharged to home after 6 hours, if symptoms improve after treatment and laboratory studies remain normal. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Call a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"516417-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>RIFAMPIN <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A minimum toxic dose has not been established.
