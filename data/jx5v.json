PHARMACOLOGY: Its main actions are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose information is limited. OVERDOSE: Limited data. Since treprostinil tablets are designed to release the active ingredient at near zero order kinetics, overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse clinical events following therapeutic doses. During clinical trials, the dose-limiting pharmacologic effects included hypotension, severe headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. ADVERSE EVENTS: ORAL: The most common adverse events reported (10% or greater) are headache, nausea and diarrhea. OTHER EFFECTS: Flushing, pain in the jaw and\/or extremities, hypokalemia and abdominal discomfort may develop. An increased risk of bleeding due to inhibition of platelet aggregation can occur. PARENTERAL: COMMON: Injection site pain and infusion site reaction occur in most patients. Other potentially serious adverse events included vasodilatation, hypotension, and edema. SUDDEN DRUG WITHDRAWAL: Abrupt discontinuation and\/or a sudden reduction in dosage can result in worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension. CYP2C8 INHIBITORS: Concomitant administration of treprostinil and strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (eg, gemfibrozil) can increase exposure to treprostinil. BLOOD PRESSURE LOWERING AGENTS: Coadministration of diuretics, antihypertensive agents and vasodilators can increase the risk of hypotension. ALCOHOL: Concomitant administration of alcohol and treprostinil can result in the drug being released at a faster rate. <br\/>"},{"id":"jx5vs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>TREPROSTINIL<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor blood pressure frequently. Assess for coingestants (eg, diuretics, antihypertensive agents, other vasodilators) that may potentiate hypotension. Assess for coingestion of alcohol, which can cause faster release and absorption. Replace fluids (oral or IV (0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg) fluids) as indicated. Gastrointestinal events (ie, vomiting and diarrhea) are likely to occur. Monitor fluid and serum electrolytes including potassium as indicated. Replace fluids (ie, oral fluids; administer intravenous fluids as needed) and electrolytes as necessary. Treat with antiemetics as needed. Obtain a baseline CBC and platelet count in patients at increased risk for bleeding (eg, patients taking anticoagulants). MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat moderate to severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine or norepinephrine as necessary. Correct any significant electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Treprostinil can inhibit platelet aggregation; therefore, patients with evidence of active bleeding or coagulation disorders require laboratory monitoring. Give blood or blood products, if bleeding develops.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital activated charcoal should be avoided, due to the likely development of vomiting following exposure. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting and is able to maintain their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary following a mild to moderate exposure. Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation in patients that develop evidence of profound hypotension, severe bleeding or shock.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs including frequent blood pressure monitoring. Monitor fluid status and electrolytes including potassium, if vomiting and diarrhea are significant. Monitor for clinical evidence of bleeding. Obtain a baseline CBC with differential in patients at risk for bleeding (eg, patients currently taking anticoagulants); repeat as indicated. Serum treprostinil concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Treprostinil is UNLIKELY to be removed by dialysis due to the high degree of protein binding (96%).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of 1 to 2 extra doses or an adult with mild gastrointestinal symptoms can be monitored at home. A child that has inadvertently chewed or broken a tablet(s) before ingesting or is suspected of chewing a tablet(s) should be evaluated in a healthcare setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with ongoing symptoms including hypotension or moderate to severe bleeding, requiring therapeutic intervention, should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or for whom the diagnosis is unclear. Consider a hematology consult in patients that develop significant bleeding.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jx5vs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>TREPROSTINIL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established.
