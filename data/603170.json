Theophylline also appears to increase the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles through enhancement of calcium uptake through adenosine-mediated channels.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"603170-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"603170-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Oral, elixir, immediate release tablets: rapid and complete, time to peak concentration, 1 h to 2 h<\/li><li>Oral, extended release tablets: time to peak concentration (400 mg tablet), 8.1 h +\/- 3.7 h (fasting) to 12.8 h +\/- 4.2 h (fed)<\/li><li>Effect of food: (Oral, elixir, immediate release tablets, extended release tablets), minimal effect on absorption<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"603170-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Vd: (Oral), 0.45 L\/kg (range 0.3 L\/kg to 0.7 L\/kg)<\/li><li>Protein binding: (Oral) 40%, primarily albumin<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"603170-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Hepatic; isoenzyme P450 CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP3A3; patients greater than 1 years old, 90% metabolized through the liver<\/li><li>Active metabolite: 3-methylxanthine; in adults with normal renal function, has one tenth the activity of theophylline<\/li><li>Active metabolite: caffeine; undetectable in adults, may accumulate in neonates and exert pharmacological effect<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"603170-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Theophylline, Renal: (greater than 3 months old), 10% unchanged<\/li><li>Theophylline, Renal: (neonates), 50% unchanged<\/li><li>Theophylline, Dialyzable: yes (hemodialysis); no (peritoneal dialysis)<\/li><li>3-methylxanthine, Renal: (greater than 3 months old), primary route<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"603170-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Premature neonates (postnatal age 3 to 15 days): mean 30 hours (17 to 43 hours) <\/li><li>Premature neonates (postnatal age 25 to 57 days): mean 20 hours (9.4 to 30.6 hours)<\/li><li>Term infants (postnatal age 1 to 2 days): mean 25.7 hours (25 to 26.5 hours)<\/li><li>Term infants (postnatal age 3 to 30 weeks): mean 11 hours (6 to 29 hours)<\/li><li>Children (1 to 4 years): mean 3.4 hours (1.2 to 26.5 hours)<\/li><li>Children (6 to 17 years): mean 3.7 hours (1.5 to 5.9 hours)<\/li><li>Adults (16 to 60 years, non-smoking asthmatics): mean 8.7 hours.(6.1 to 12.8 hours)<\/li><li>Elderly (greater than 60 years): mean 9.8 hours (1.6 to 18 hours)<\/li><li>Acute pulmonary edema: median 19 hours (3.1  to 8.2 hours)<\/li><li>COPD (elderly over 60 years age): mean 11 hours (9.4  to 12.6 hours)<\/li><li>Cystic fibrosis (age 14 to 28 years): mean 6 hours (1.8 to 10.2 hours)<\/li><li>Fever (acute viral respiratory illness children 9 to 15 years): 7 hours (1 to 13 hours)<\/li><li>Acute hepatitis: mean 19.2 hours (16.6  to 21.8 hours)<\/li><li>Cirrhosis: median 32 hours (10 to 56 hours)<\/li><li>Cholestasis: mean 14.4 hours (5.7 to 31.8 hours)<\/li><li>Pregnancy: First trimester, mean 8.5 hours (3.1 to 13.9 hours); Second trimester, mean 8.8 hours (3.8 to 13.8 hours); Third trimester, 13 hours (8.4 to 17.6 hours)<\/li><li>Sepsis: mean 18.8 hours (6.3 to 21.4 hours)<\/li><li>Hypothyroid: mean 11.6 hours (8.2 to 25 hours)<\/li><li>Hyperthyroid: mean 4.5 hours (3.7 to 5.6 hours)<\/li><\/ul>"}]},"9":{"id":"603170-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>for intravenous use only<\/li><li>no additives should be made to the theophylline and D5W injections<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(extended release capsules) may be opened, sprinkled over soft, non-hot food (ie. applesauce or pudding); swallow immediately without chewing.

PHARMACOLOGY: It inhibits phosphodiesterase, which increases in cyclic adenine monophosphate and catecholamine release, and is also an adenosine receptor antagonist. TOXICOLOGY: Increase catecholamine levels (epinephrine and norepinephrine) cause tachycardia, hypotension, anxiety and hyperglycemia. Adenosine receptor antagonism may cause seizures. EPIDEMIOLOGY: The incidence of poisoning has declined dramatically in recent years. Poisoning is uncommon, but serious toxicity and deaths are reported every year. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sinus tachycardia, sustained complex atrial or ventricle ectopy, tremor, agitation, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia can develop. SEVERE TOXICITY: Seizures, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, and ventricular dysrhythmias can occur. CHRONIC OVERDOSE: Gastrointestinal symptoms may be mild or absent and metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia and hyperglycemia generally do not develop. Severe effects, such as seizures and hemodynamically significant dysrhythmias, are more common with chronic overdoses than with acute overdoses. Onset of symptoms may occur abruptly. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Palpitations, tachycardia, chest pain, headache, tremor, insomnia, irritability, psychosis, visual hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and a decrease in esophageal sphincter tone can develop. <br\/>"},{"id":"603170-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>THEOPHYLLINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Establish IV access and place the patient on a cardiac monitor. Treat nausea with antiemetic and administer IV fluids. Monitor electrolytes. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: The primary effect of theophylline is increased sympathomimetic effects. The primary treatment is sedation with benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam 1 to 2 mg IV every 5 min titrated to effect); high doses may be required. Hemodynamically significant tachycardia should be treated with esmolol, which can paradoxically improve blood pressure in severely tachycardic patients. Hypotension should be treated with IV fluids. Adrenergic vasopressors can theoretically make tachycardia worse, but there are numerous reports of successful treatment of severe toxicity with these agents. Vasopressin is of theoretical value and has been used effectively in a case of caffeine poisoning. Lidocaine administration has been associated with successful treatment of ventricular fibrillation. Hemodialysis should be performed in patients with severe toxicity, and patients with high serum theophylline concentrations (80 to 100 mcg\/mL after acute overdose, 40 to 60 mcg\/mL with chronic toxicity).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Avoid GI decontamination as patients are at high risk to vomit and suffer abrupt deterioration. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be administered to patients who have a significant acute ingestion. As theophylline can cause seizures and vomiting, most patients should be intubated prior to charcoal administration. Whole bowel irrigation may be helpful in the case of a sustained-release overdose, if there is evidence of ongoing theophylline absorption; however, it can be difficult to perform in patients with severe toxicity or persistent emesis.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Severe neurotoxicity (ie, tetanic muscle spasm, leg cramps, and paraplegia) have been reported following inadvertent intrathecal injection of aminophylline. The following recommendations are based on experience with other drugs.  Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP per liter NS or LR) or albumin 5% have also been used for perfusion. Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Multiple dose activated charcoal administration (25 g every 4 hours) increases elimination of theophylline from the plasma, but administration may be difficult in patients with severe toxicity or persistent vomiting. Ondansetron and metoclopramide may facilitate charcoal administration. HEMODIALYSIS: (treatment of choice) increases the elimination rate of theophylline. Consider dialysis early, if the plasma theophylline concentration approaches 40 to 60 mcg\/mL in CHRONIC overdose, or 80 to 100 mcg\/mL in ACUTE intoxications and\/or significant signs of intoxication are present (hemodynamic compromise, seizures, mental status changes). Elderly patients and those with underlying disease, particularly cardiac, may require dialysis at lower concentrations. HEMOPERFUSION: In the past, hemoperfusion has been recommended. However, few facilities currently offer hemoperfusion and current dialysis membranes provide theophylline clearance rates similar to those provided by hemoperfusion.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Determine serial (every 1 to 2 hours) serum theophylline concentrations until the concentration begins to fall.   A peak theophylline level may not occur for many hours after overdose of a sustained-release preparation, and can be delayed for up to 24 hours. Monitor serum glucose and serum electrolytes. Monitor CPK levels and renal function in patients with seizures. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients who are not chronically taking theophylline and who unintentionally ingest 10 mg\/kg or less can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with an acute ingestion of immediate-release preparations who have only mild clinical effects (ie, mild tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, tremor) can be observed in the ED with activated charcoal therapy, cardiac monitoring and serial theophylline levels. Patients may be discharged when serum theophylline levels fall below 20 mcg\/mL and symptoms resolve. Patients with worsening signs and symptoms, ingestion of a sustained-release product or rising levels should be admitted to a monitored setting. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admit all patients with chronic intoxication, patients with an acute ingestion of a sustained-release product and those with acute ingestions in whom serum theophylline levels are not falling. Patients with symptoms beyond mild tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and tremor and those whose symptoms do not resolve should be admitted. Because of the potential for severe toxicity, most patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients who are at risk for developing life-threatening toxicity (chronic overdose with serum theophylline levels greater than 40 to 60 mcg\/mL, age greater than 60 years or less than 3 years, acute overdose with serum theophylline levels greater than 80 to 100 mcg\/mL) should be transferred to a facility where emergent hemodialysis is available. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for any patient with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Consult a nephrologist early in any patient with severe toxicity or rapidly rising theophylline concentrations.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"603170-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>THEOPHYLLINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose is not well defined.
