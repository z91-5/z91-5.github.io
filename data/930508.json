The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fatigue. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Ezetimibe is generally well tolerated by most patients.   Back pain, arthralgia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, sinusitis, coughing, pharyngitis, fatigue, pancreatitis, and hepatotoxicity have been reported following ezetimibe therapy. <br\/><\/li><li><b>LOVASTATIN AND RELATED DRUGS <\/b><br\/>USES: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The following agents are available in the United States: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. Atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin are also available in combination with other agents (atorvastatin\/amlodipine; lovastatin\/niacin; pravastatin\/aspirin; simvastatin\/ezetimibe; simvastatin\/niacin; simvastatin\/sitagliptin). PHARMACOLOGY: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, preventing conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate determining enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Ingestion of up to 6 grams of lovastatin has been reported without specific effects or sequelae. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not expected, unless a coingestant is present. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain, myopathy, myalgias, rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, dermatitis, diplopia, blepharoptosis (ptosis), ophthalmoplegia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have been reported in patients receiving statins. Other reported adverse effects (rare) include hyperkalemia (lovastatin), photosensitivity (simvastatin), dermatomyositis (simvastatin and pravastatin), limb compartment syndrome (simvastatin and atorvastatin), acute renal failure (lovastatin), pancreatitis (pravastatin and lovastatin\/gemfibrozil), chest pain (pravastatin), atrial fibrillation (simvastatin), vasculitis (atorvastatin), hemolytic anemia (lovastatin), thrombocytopenic purpura (atorvastatin), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (simvastatin), akathisia (lovastatin), extrapyramidal effects (lovastatin), nasopharyngitis (atorvastatin), upper respiratory infection (pravastatin), cough (pravastatin), lung fibrosis (simvastatin), peripheral neuropathy (lovastatin and simvastatin).<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930508-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>EZETIMIBE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Consider activated charcoal.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor fluid and electrolyte status in patients with significant diarrhea.

ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
