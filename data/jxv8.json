Bedaquiline is used in combination with other therapies to treat multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. It is not indicated for the treatment of latent, extra-pulmonary or drug-sensitive tuberculosis. PHARMACOLOGY: Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline antimycobacterial agent. It inhibits mycobacterial ATP synthase which is an enzyme required for the generation of energy in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is uncommon. ADVERSE EVENTS: Nausea, arthralgia and headache were the most common adverse events occurring in 10% or more of patients treated with bedaquiline. Bedaquiline can prolong the QT interval. Other events include elevated liver enzymes, hemoptysis and chest pain. OVERDOSE: There are no reports of overdose with bedaquiline. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Clinical events are likely an extension of therapeutic adverse events and may include nausea, arthralgia and headache. Elevated liver enzymes may develop. SEVERE TOXICITY: Prolongation of QT interval may occur following overdose. Although there are no reports of torsades de pointes, it may develop following a significant exposure or in combination with other QT prolonging drugs. <br\/>"},{"id":"jxv8s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BEDAQUILINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY:  Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. QT prolongation has been reported with therapeutic doses and may occur following overdose. Obtain serial ECGs and institute continuous cardiac monitoring following a significant exposure. In patients who develop QT prolongation, monitor serum electrolytes including potassium, calcium and magnesium in patients with significant overdose; correct any abnormalities. At the time of this review, torsades de pointes has not been reported with therapy.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not likely to be necessary following a minor exposure, but should be considered after a large ingestion if the patient is alert. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal for a large overdose if the ingestion is recent and the patient is not vomiting and the airway can be maintained.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary unless other toxic agents have been administered concurrently.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs to evaluate for evidence of QT prolongation. If QT prolongation is present, monitor serum electrolytes including potassium, calcium and magnesium. Correct any abnormalities. Monitor liver enzymes (ie, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) following a significant exposure. Serum bedaquiline concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unlikely that hemodialysis would be useful after overdose because of significant protein binding (99.9%).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A minor (a single dose) inadvertent dose in an asymptomatic patient currently being treated with bedaquiline can likely be managed at home. An asymptomatic child with an inadvertent exposure (a single dose) can likely be monitored at home, if a responsible adult is present. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions or who are symptomatic should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent dysrhythmias should be admitted with ongoing ECG and electrolyte monitoring; correct any electrolyte abnormalities. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or for whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxv8s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>BEDAQUILINE<\/b><br\/>TOXIC DOSE: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
