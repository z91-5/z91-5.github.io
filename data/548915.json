It is used as a filler in breast implants. It has been injected directly into tissue for cosmetic purposes, although this is not a medically approved use. Simethicone is used to treat colic and gaseous distension. PHARMACOLOGY: Simethicone is though to decrease gaseous distension by decreasing surface tension of gas bubbles in the GI tract. TOXICOLOGY: Silicones are generally not toxic, but injection may result in local granuloma formation. Systemic absorption of a large amount may produce silicone pulmonary embolism. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Environmental exposure is common. Injection for cosmetic purposes is uncommon. Life-threatening effects are very rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Ingestion is not expected to produce significant toxicity. Injection may produce local tissue granuloma formation. SEVERE TOXICITY: Direct injection into tissue can cause a severe systemic reaction with fever, pneumonitis, widespread microemboli and associated tissue infarction (primarily lungs but also intestines, liver, brain and heart), acute lung injury, and alveolar hemorrhage. Fatalities have been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"548915-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SILICONES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Minimal symptoms are expected and no specific care is required.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who are symptomatic, patients who have injected silicone, and those with deliberate ingestions, should be referred to a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain persistently symptomatic should be admitted and monitored for worsening respiratory symptoms.
