PHARMACOLOGY: Mefloquine is an antimalarial drug that directly acts as a Plasmodium schizonticide. It exhibits its effect on the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium species; however, its exact mechanism is still unknown. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Mefloquine overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. An anticholinergic syndrome, including mydriasis, agitation, delirium, rigors, and fever, has been reported after an overdose. Overdose can also cause dizziness, vertigo, headache, panic attacks, and a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as psychosis and seizures. These effects may persist for several weeks. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Gastrointestinal effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) and mild CNS effects (eg, headache, dizziness, loss of balance, somnolence, and sleep disorders).  OTHER EFFECTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (eg, insomnia, visual and auditory hallucinations, panic attacks, depression, anxiety, psychosis, and seizures), skin rashes, urticaria, pruritus, muscle weakness, myalgia, elevated liver enzymes, bradycardia, prolongation of the QTc interval, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and rarely thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.  Pneumonitis, possibly of allergic etiology, has been infrequently reported during postmarketing surveillance of mefloquine. Since mefloquine has a long elimination half-life (13 to 24 days), adverse effects may persist for several weeks after drug cessation. <br\/>"},{"id":"365975-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MEFLOQUINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: All patients with symptoms of mefloquine toxicity should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In the case of neuropsychiatric symptoms, supportive pharmacotherapy such as antipsychotic medications or benzodiazepines may be given. Antiemetics may be administered for gastrointestinal symptoms as needed. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  In the case of neuropsychiatric symptoms, supportive pharmacotherapy such as antipsychotic medications or benzodiazepines may be given. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of severe psychomotor agitation, repeated seizure activity, or evidence of severe cardiotoxicity. Bradycardia does not usually require treatment, administer atropine if hypotension develops; if unresponsive, use beta adrenergic agonists (eg, isoproterenol). Consider temporary pacemaker insertion. Therapeutic doses of mefloquine may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of mefloquine and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsade de pointes. Treat torsade de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities, overdrive pacing.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be avoided in the prehospital setting because of the risk of seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a recent, significant overdose who is alert or in whom airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (ie, seizures, severe agitation, signs of cardiotoxicity).<\/li><li>Antidote: Physostigmine reversed anticholinergic signs and symptoms in one patient with mefloquine overdose. Usual dose is 1 to 2 mg slowly intravenously.<\/li><li>Delirium: Liberal use of benzodiazepines until patient is sedated. Consider physostigmine if patients had anticholinergic findings on exam.<\/li><li>Psychotic disorder: Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics may be used until symptoms resolve, which may take several weeks.<\/li><li>Bradycardia: Usually does not require treatment. If hypotension ensures, treat bradycardia with atropine; if unresponsive, use beta adrenergic agonists (eg, isoproterenol). Consider temporary pacemaker insertion.<\/li><li>Tachycardia: Tachycardia may occur from the development of agitation or anticholinergic effects and usually resolves with sedation..<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; add propofol, or barbiturates if seizures recur or persist.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Has not been reported but might develop secondary to QTc prolongation. Treat torsade de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities, overdrive pacing may be necessary.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Mefloquine concentrations are not readily available or useful to guide therapy. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring after a significant overdose.  Monitor blood glucose and liver enzymes after a significant overdose. Consider head CT and lumbar puncture to rule out intracranial mass, bleeding, or infection if diagnosis is not certain. CPK should be obtained if the patient has had psychomotor agitation or seizure activity.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of benefit because of the large volume of distribution and extensive protein binding of mefloquine.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Only asymptomatic adults with small, inadvertent ingestions can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions, symptomatic patients, or children with inadvertent ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation for at least 4 hours as symptoms of severe toxicity will likely develop within this time period. Symptomatic patients should be observed for 24 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous stimulation and\/or abnormal vital signs should be admitted. Patients with seizures, dysrhythmias, or any other life-threatening result of toxicity or intubated patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"365975-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MEFLOQUINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose of mefloquine in humans has not been established.
