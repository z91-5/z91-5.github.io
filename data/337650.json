Intrathecal administration of leucovorin calcium has been associated with seizures, severe neurotoxicity and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: Allergic sensitization, anaphylactoid reactions, and urticaria have been reported. Anaphylactic reactions including shock have also been reported. OTHER: Most adverse effects reported with leucovorin calcium appear to occur when it is combined with 5-flourouracil (leucovorin calcium appears to enhance the toxicity of 5FU). The most commonly reported effects are leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis and alopecia. Dermatitis, constipation, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, lethargy, malaise, and fatigue have also been reported in patients receiving leucovorin calcium in combination with 5FU.
