Benzoyl peroxide is used in industry as an oxidizing agent, a polymerization initiator, a catalyst, and a curing agent. Benzoyl peroxide is utilized as a source of free radicals in organic synthesis, and is used in dental resin cement, for automobile body putty, in roof bolting, and in the mining industry. PHARMACOLOGY: Benzoyl peroxide has antimicrobial activity. TOXICOLOGY: Benzoyl peroxide is irritating to skin and mucous membranes. Allergic dermatitis may occur. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare and clinically significant toxicity has not been reported. OVERDOSE: No overdoses resulting in significant toxicity have been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Contact dermatitis, xeroderma, erythema, and skin peeling.<br\/><\/li><li><b>MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTICS <\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Significant toxicity following acute overdose is uncommon.

Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta-2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area extremely thoroughly with soap and water. A physician may need to examine the area if irritation or pain persists after washing. EYE EXPOSURE: Irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia persist, the patient should be seen in a health care facility.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated.
