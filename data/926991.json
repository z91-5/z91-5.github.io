PHARMACOLOGY: Ziprasidone is an atypical second generation antipsychotic that is chemically unrelated to phenothiazine or butyrophenone antipsychotics.  It is a substituted benzisothiazoyl piperazine that exhibits potent and highly selective dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonistic activities.  Its neuropharmacological profile is distinct from those of both standard and newer antipsychotics. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence, agitation, dizziness, slurred speech, extrapyramidal symptoms (eg, dystonia, akathisia, dyskinesia). SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, prolonged QRS and QTc intervals, torsades de pointes. Respiratory depression may occur following massive overdoses due to CNS depression. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (5% or greater): Somnolence, dizziness, lightheadedness, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms (eg, hypertonia, dystonia, dyskinesia, hypokinesia, tremor), nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, dry mouth, headache, abnormal vision. OTHER EFFECTS: Insomnia, agitation, anxiety, rash, urticaria, prolonged QT, torsades de pointes, hypotension, tachycardia, hypertension, oculogyric crisis, seizures, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and serotonin syndrome. <br\/>"},{"id":"926991-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ZIPRASIDONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. Control agitation and confusion with benzodiazepines. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat agitation with benzodiazepines. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. If hypotension is unresponsive to IV fluids, agents with alpha adrenergic effects, such an norepinephrine or phenylephrine, may be preferred. Agents with beta adrenergic activity, such as epinephrine or dopamine, may worsen hypotension in the setting of ziprasidone-induced alpha blockade. Manage severe extrapyramidal symptoms with anticholinergics and\/or benzodiazepines. Therapeutic doses of ziprasidone may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of ziprasidone and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary. Treat QRS widening with sodium bicarbonate. Cardiovert unstable ventricular dysrhythmias; treat stable ventricular dysrhythmias unresponsive to bicarbonate with lidocaine. Although rare, treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome with benzodiazepines, bromocriptine, consider dantrolene, as well as cooling and supportive measures.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended due to the potential for somnolence, seizures and dystonic reaction. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with serious cardiac toxicity, coma or significant CNS or respiratory depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Administer IV fluids.  In theory, agents with beta adrenergic activity, such as epinephrine or dopamine, may worsen hypotension in the setting of ziprasidone-induced alpha blockade. If hypotension is unresponsive to IV fluids, agents with alpha adrenergic effects, such an norepinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mcg\/kg\/min, titrate as needed to desired response) or phenylephrine (100 to 180 mcg\/min, titrate as needed to desired response), may be preferred.<\/li><li>Drug-induced dystonia: ADULTS: Benztropine 1 to 2 mg IV or diphenhydramine 1 mg\/kg\/dose IV over 2 minutes. CHILDREN: Diphenhydramine 1 mg\/kg\/dose IV over 2 minutes (maximum 5 mg\/kg\/day or 50 mg\/m(2)\/day).<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders (particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia). Sodium bicarbonate is generally first line therapy for QRS widening and ventricular dysrhythmias, administer 1 to 2 mEq\/kg, repeat as needed to maintain blood pH between 7.45 and 7.55. In patients unresponsive to bicarbonate, consider lidocaine. Because ziprasidone has caused Torsades de pointes and QTc prolongation, amiodarone should only be used with extreme caution.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Torsades de pointes may develop secondary to QTc prolongation. Treat torsade de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities, overdrive pacing may be necessary.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Oral bromocriptine, benzodiazepines or oral or IV dantrolene in conjunction with cooling and other supportive measures.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not likely to be beneficial due to extensive protein binding and a volume of distribution of approximately 1.5 L\/kg.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum ziprasidone levels are not readily available at most facilities, and are not  useful for guiding therapy after overdose.  Monitor vital signs and mental status after significant overdose. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS depression, seizures, and extrapyramidal reactions after significant overdose. Monitor arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, and pulmonary function tests in patients with respiratory depression.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Children less than 12 years of age who are naive to ziprasidone can be observed at home following an unintentional ingestion of less than 80 mg and are only experiencing mild sedation. All patients, 12 years of age or older, who are naive to ziprasidone, can be observed at home following an unintentional ingestion of 100 mg or less and are experiencing only mild sedation. All patients who are taking ziprasidone on a chronic basis can be observed at home if they have acutely ingested no more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) of ziprasidone. Patients who have not developed signs or symptoms more than 6 hours after ingestion are unlikely to develop toxicity. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with a deliberate ingestion or more than minor symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility. Children less than 12 years of age who are naive to ziprasidone should be referred to a healthcare facility following an unintentional ingestion of 80 mg or more. All patients, 12 years of age or older, who are naive to ziprasidone should be referred to a healthcare facility following an unintentional ingestion of more than 100 mg. All patients who are taking ziprasidone on a chronic basis should be referred to a healthcare facility following an acute ingestion of more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) of ziprasidone. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions demonstrating cardiotoxicity or persistent neurotoxicity should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926991-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ZIPRASIDONE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY:  SUMMARY: A dose of more than 80 mg is potentially toxic in a drug naive child less than 12 years old. A dose of more than 100 mg is potentially toxic in a drug naive child aged 12 years or greater. In children on chronic ziprasidone therapy an acute ingestion of more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) is potentially toxic. ADULT: One patient developed extrapyramidal symptoms and only a modest increase in the QTc interval after ingesting 12.8 g of ziprasidone. An adult developed QTc prolongation and an episode or Torsades de pointes after ingesting 6 g ziprasidone, ethanol and fluoxetine. PEDIATRIC: A 22-month-old girl developed somnolence, drooling, hypertension, and poor muscle tone after ingesting 800 mg of ziprasidone. She recovered following supportive care. A 30-month-old developed coma and respiratory depression after ingesting 40 mg of ziprasidone. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: ADULTS: ORAL: 20 to 80 mg orally twice daily. INTRAMUSCULAR: 10 mg every 2 hours or 20 mg every 4 hours intramuscularly up to a maximum dose of 40 mg daily. CHILDREN: The safety and effectiveness of ziprasidone in pediatric patients have not been established. <br\/>"}]},{"id":"926991-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Tell patient to immediately report symptoms of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), including rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to immediately report symptoms of QT-interval prolongation (ie, dizziness, syncope, palpitations).<\/li><li>Patient should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination, as this medicine may cause somnolence.<\/li><li>Tell patient to immediately report symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), including very high fever, rigid muscles, shaking, confusion, sweating, or increased heart rate.<\/li><li>Drug may impair heat regulation.
