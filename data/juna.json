PHARMACOLOGY: Galantamine, a tertiary alkaloid, is a reversible, competitive and long-acting inhibitor of cholinesterase activity. TOXICOLOGY: Galantamine can produce cholinomimetic effects. Overdose effects of cholinergic agonists generally involve the central nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, and the neuromuscular junction. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon. OVERDOSE: Limited data. Due to the cholinomimetic activity of galantamine, an overdose may be expected to result in muscarinic actions consisting of miosis, vomiting, salivation, lacrimation, increased bronchial secretions, involuntary urination and\/or defecation, sweating, flushing, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression and\/or seizures.  MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Bradycardia, sweating, and vomiting have been reported after acute overdose.  SEVERE TOXICITY: Near-syncope, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia have been reported after acute overdose. Cholinergic crisis may be characterized by severe cardiovascular events (bradycardia, hypotension, various dysrhythmias including torsades de pointes). A fatal overdose may result from respiratory muscle weakness with respiratory failure. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  COMMON: Nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss and sleep disturbances were the most frequent adverse events. SEVERE: Bradyarrhythmia, cardiac dysrhythmia, heart failure, esophageal perforation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and death may develop.<br\/>"},{"id":"junas12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>GALANTAMINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Signs and symptoms of overdose are anticipated to be due to cholinomimetic effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, lacrimation, defecation). ATROPINE: ADULT: 1 to 2 mg IV, repeat every 3 to 60 min as needed to control symptoms, then as needed for 24 to 48 hr. CHILD: 0.05 mg\/kg IM or IV (up to 4 mg) repeat every 10 to 30 min as necessary. CARDIOVASCULAR: Monitor vital signs and institute continuous cardiac monitoring; bradycardia, hypotension and QT prolongation have been observed. HYPOTENSION: IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 mL to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine. SEVERE TOXICITY: Due to its cholinomimetic action, severe toxicity may produce cardiac dysrhythmias, seizures, bronchospasm, respiratory depression, and acute lung injury. Immediate assessment and evaluation. Airway management may be necessary. ANTIDOTE: Administer atropine for muscarinic manifestations (e.g. salivation, diarrhea, bronchorrhea). Initially treat seizures with benzodiazepines. TORSADES DE POINTES: Immediate electrical cardioversion, if hemodynamically unstable. Treatment with magnesium; atrial overdrive pacing is also indicated. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION. Muscle weakness may lead to respiratory failure.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered after a potentially toxic ingestion, if the patient is alert and able to protect their airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain airway or if airway is protected. Consider gastric lavage after a large, recent ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: Assess airway and respiratory function. Administer oxygen. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary because of respiratory muscle weakness or bronchorrhea.<\/li><li>Antidote: Atropine may be used as an antidote for overdosage. ADULT: 1 to 2 mg IV, repeated every 3 to 60 minutes as needed to control symptoms, then as needed for 24 to 48 hours. CHILD: 0.05 mg\/kg IM or IV (up to 4 mg) repeated every 10 to 30 minutes as necessary, Atropine is used to treat muscarinic effects (e.g. salivation, lacrimation, defecation, urination, bronchorrhea). <\/li><li>Seizure: IV benzodiazepines are indicated for seizures or agitation, diazepam 5 to 10 mg IV, lorazepam 2 to 4 mg IV, repeat as needed.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV fluids, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Bronchospasm: Administer beta2 adrenergic agonists. Consider use of inhaled corticosteroids and ipratropium.  Monitor peak expiratory flow rate, monitor for hypoxia and respiratory failure, and administer oxygen as necessary.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation; frequently monitor ABGs and pulse oximetry. Mechanical ventilation and positive-end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be required.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor and support respiratory and cardiovascular function. Obtain a baseline ECG and continuous cardiac monitoring following a significant exposure. Monitor clinical exam for evidence of muscarinic (e.g. bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, salivation, lacrimation, defecation, urination, miosis) nicotinic (e.g. muscle weakness or fasciculations, respiratory insufficiency) or CNS (e.g. seizures, coma) manifestations of cholinergic toxicity.  Monitor and replace fluids and electrolytes as needed.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown whether galantamine or its metabolites can be removed by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration. Galantamine has a relatively low plasma protein binding of 18% with a mean volume of distribution of 175 L.  <\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child with a minor ingestion (ie a single immediate release tablet) can likely be monitored at home with adult supervision. An adult that has taken an inadvertent extra dose is not likely to develop symptoms. OBSERVATION CRITERIA:  Patients with deliberate ingestions, adults with symptoms or ingestions of more than the therapeutic dose, or a pediatric ingestion should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Monitor for at least 3to 6 hours. EXTENDED RELEASE: Patients ingesting extended release preparations should be observed for at least 7 to 12 hours (Tmax is 4.5 to 5 hours at a therapeutic dose) and admitted if symptoms develop; effects may be delayed and prolonged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All intentional ingestions should be initially managed as a severe exposure. Patients who develop signs or symptoms of cholinergic toxicity (muscarinic, nicotinic or central) should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for assistance with any patient with moderate to severe cholinergic manifestations.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"junas12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>GALANTAMINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established.
