Due to the pharmacologic actions of calcitonin, hypocalcemic tetany may be expected to occur following an overdose, although this has not yet been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Severe allergic reactions, including one death, have been reported following therapeutic administration of injectable calcitonin. Other adverse effects that may occur with injectable calcitonin therapy include transient nausea and vomiting, flushing of face and hands, skin rashes, nocturia, poor appetite, abdominal pain, and edema of the feet. Therapy with calcitonin nasal spray may result in rhinitis, epistaxis, sinusitis, nasal ulcerations, and back pain.<br\/>"},{"id":"99515-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CALCITONIN (SALMON)<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Activated charcoal is not indicated.

Monitor urinalysis; casts containing renal tubular epithelial cells and coarse granular casts were reported in volunteers who were on bedrest and were given injectable calcitonin-salmon during a clinical trial.

PAGET'S DISEASE: Initial dose is 100 international units SUBQ or IM daily; maintenance dose is 50 international units SUBQ or IM daily or every other day. HYPERCALCEMIA: Initial dose is 4 international units\/kg SUBQ or IM every 12 hours. After 1 to 2 days, may be increased to 8 international units\/kg SUBQ or IM every 12 hours. After another 2 days, may be increased to a maximum of 8 international units\/kg SUBQ or IM every 6 hours if necessary. POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS: 100 international units SUBQ or IM every other day, or intranasal administration of 200 international units (1 spray) daily, alternating nostrils daily.
