PHARMACOLOGY: It is a type IA antidysrhythmic with electrophysiological properties similar to quinidine. Its primary effect on the heart is to decrease electrical impulse conduction velocity through atrial and ventricular tissue; clinically this translates to prolongation of the PR and QRS intervals on the ECG. TOXICOLOGY: Procainamide binds to fast sodium channels and decreases cardiac excitability and conduction velocity while increasing the effective refractory period of the atria, His-Purkinje system, and ventricles. Toxic concentrations may prolong AV conduction or induce AV block. It has weak vagal blocking action, no alpha-adrenergic blockade, and less myocardial depression than quinidine. It also has anticholinergic properties. It has local anesthetic effects similar to procaine. The major metabolite (N-acetylprocainamide or NAPA) has type III antidysrhythmic activity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Procainamide poisoning is rare, but severe cardiovascular toxicity and deaths can occur after inadvertent or deliberate exposures. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, mydriasis, tachycardia, and decreased bowel sounds. SEVERE TOXICITY: Confusion, agitation, seizures, hypotension, conduction delays (eg, QRS and QTc prolongation, AV block), ventricular dysrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, and torsades de pointes), and respiratory depression. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Cardiovascular effects include atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias, junctional tachycardia, hypotension, and ventricular conduction delays, torsades de pointes, and ventricular fibrillation. Gastrointestinal effects may also occur. CNS effects include depression, cerebellar ataxia, and toxic psychosis. Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by fever, arthralgias, myalgias, pleural effusion and pain, and serositis. <br\/>"},{"id":"adkws12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PROCAINAMIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients with mild symptoms such as gastrointestinal effects following exposure should be treated with supportive care and be placed on a cardiac monitor. Avoid other type 1A antidysrhythmic medications. Replete magnesium and potassium. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: All patients with severe toxicity should have IV access and continuous cardiac monitoring. Avoid using other type IA antidysrhythmics. Cardiovert unstable rhythms. Treat wide complex dysrhythmias with hypertonic sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV). Lidocaine and phenytoin are the antidysrhythmic agents of choice for persistent dysrhythmias. Hypotension should initially be treated with isotonic fluid resuscitation and inotropic medications. Seizures are treated with benzodiazepine. Treat torsade de pointes with standard interventions including magnesium and overdrive pacing. Pacemaker insertion should be considered for increasing AV block. Lipid emulsion therapy has not been evaluated but is of theoretical value for procainamide poisoning. Cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered for patients with severe toxicity not responding to other interventions.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of potential for somnolence and seizures. HOSPITAL: In the serious toxicity, decontamination is an appropriate intervention. Gastric lavage (with airway management if needed) should be considered and activated charcoal should be administered to all potentially toxic ingestions.<\/li><li>Airway management: Maintain open airway and perform orotracheal intubation in patients with seizures, CNS depression or ventricular dysrhythmias.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: SODIUM BICARBONATE: Because procainamide binds to fast sodium channels, ventricular dysrhythmias may respond to IV sodium bicarbonate. Starting dose is 1 to 2 mEq\/kg as an IV bolus. Monitor arterial blood gases and ECG. INTRAVENOUS LIPID EMULSION: Consider intravenous lipid emulsion in patients with dysrhythmias. DOSE: Initial intravenous bolus of 1.5 mL\/kg 20% intralipid over 1 minute. Repeat the bolus injection twice at 5 minute intervals if adequate circulation has not been restored. Follow with an intravenous infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min of 20% intralipid over 30 to 60 minutes. After another 5 minutes, increase the infusion rate to 0.5 mL\/kg\/min if adequate circulation has not been restored. Continue CPR throughout. MECHANICAL CARDIORESPIRATORY SUPPORT: Cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered for patients with severe toxicity not responding to other interventions.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and perform serial ECGs. Monitor serum electrolytes (including magnesium) and renal function. Monitoring drug concentrations of procainamide and its active metabolite, N-acetylprocainamide, may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of procainamide toxicity, but they are not useful to guide therapy. Toxicity increases as plasma procainamide concentrations exceed 10 mcg\/mL and are common in patients with plasma concentrations above 15 mcg\/mL.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion should be performed early in patients with severe toxicity. Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration may be of benefit in those patients that are hemodynamically unstable and when hemodialysis would not be feasible.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: All the overdose patients should be sent to the hospital. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Overdose patients should be monitored for at least 8 hours for mental status changes, conduction delays, dysrhythmias or hypotension. Patients who ingested sustained release preparations should be monitored for at least 24 hours.
