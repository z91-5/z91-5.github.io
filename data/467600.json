Through contraction of the iris sphincter muscle, increased tension on the scleral spur and opening of the trabecular meshwork spaces occurs to facilitate the outflow of aqueous humor. Intraocular pressure is reduced as outflow resistance is reduced.<\/li><li>Systemic: Pilocarpine is a cholinergic parasympathomimetic agent that exerts a broad spectrum of pharmacologic effects with predominantly muscarinic action, including stimulation of exocrine function. This stimulation results in increased secretion by the exocrine glands, including the salivary glands. Other exocrine glands, such as the sweat, lacrimal, gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal glands, as well as the mucous cells of the respiratory tract, may be stimulated.<\/li><li>Pilocarpine may have paradoxical effects on the cardiovascular system. Instead of the expected muscarinic effect of vasodepression occurring, pilocarpine may produce short-lived hypotension followed by hypertension. In addition, both bradycardia and tachycardia have been reported..<\/li><li>Gastrointestinal effects include smooth muscle stimulation of the intestinal tract that may result in increased tone and motility, spasm, and tenesmus. The tone and motility of the urinary tract, gallbladder, and biliary duct smooth muscle may be enhanced. .<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"467600-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"467600-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Tmax, Oral: 0.85 to 1.25 hours<\/li><li>Effect of food: rate of absorption decreased<\/li><\/ul>"},"1":{"id":"467600-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Protein binding: none <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"467600-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: unchanged and degradation products; extent not described<\/li><li>Total body clearance, mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency: 30% lower<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"467600-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>healthy volunteers: 0.76 to 1.35 hours<\/li><li>hepatic impairment, mild to moderate: 2.1 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"467600-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Ophthalmic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(solution) separate administration of other topical ophthalmic agents by at least 5 minutes<\/li><li>(solution) punctal occlusion for 2 minutes following instillation limits systemic exposure<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"467600-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>(ophthalmic) reduction in intraocular pressure indicates efficacy<\/li><li>(oral) improvement in dry mouth symptoms indicates efficacy<\/li><li>(solution) fundus examination before therapy initiation<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"467600-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Ophthalmic Solution: 1 %, 2 %, 4 %<\/li><li>Oral Tablet: 5 MG, 7.5 MG<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Isopto Carpine<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 0.25 %, 1 %, 2 %, 4 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Pilopine-HS<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Gel\/Jelly: 4 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Salagen<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 5 MG, 7.5 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"467600-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patients using ophthalmic form may experience decreased visual acuity in dim light.
