Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body, including the eye. Carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active of which is carbonic anhydrase II. Carbonic anhydrase II is found primarily in red blood cells, but it also appears in other tissues. <\/li><li>Antiglaucoma agent-Brinzolamide inhibits human carbonic anhydrase II. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions, with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure, and thereby a reduction in the risk of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. In clinical studies of up to 3 months in duration in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, brinzolamide had an intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect of approximately 4 or 5 mm of mercury (mm Hg). <\/li><li>When brinzolamide was administered orally in doses of 1 mg twice a day for up to 32 weeks to healthy volunteers, inhibition of carbonic anhydrase II activity at steady state was approximately 70 to 75%, which was less than the degree of inhibition considered to be necessary for a pharmacological effect on renal function and respiration in healthy persons. (The oral dose of 1 mg twice daily approximates the amount of medication delivered systemically by ophthalmic administration of 1% brinzolamide to both eyes three times per day, and simulates systemic drug and metabolite concentrations similar to those achieved with long-term ophthalmic dosing.) <\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"924710-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"924710-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Ophthalmic: Active metabolite: N-desethyl metabolite <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"924710-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Ophthalmic: Renal <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"924710-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Ophthalmic:  111 d <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"924710-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Ophthalmic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>shake well before use<\/li><li>remove contact lenses before administration and wait 15 min before reinserting<\/li><li>allow at least 10 min between administration of multiple ophthalmic products<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"924710-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"intraocular pressure<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"924710-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Azopt<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Suspension: 1 %<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"924710-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"924710-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>CARBONIC ANHYDRASE INHIBITORS<\/b><br\/>USES: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) are used in the treatment of glaucoma, congestive heart failure, hydrocephalus, acute mountain sickness, and seizure disorder. Agents include acetaZOLAMIDE, brinzolamide, dorzolamide, and methazolamide. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents inhibit carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme found in red blood cells and other tissues, that catalyzes the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. These agents work in various ways on different organ systems. In the eye, CAI decreases the formation of bicarbonate ions, resulting in reduced sodium and fluid transport. This decrease in aqueous humor secretion reduces intraocular pressure. In the brain, CAI may decrease excessive discharge, thus raising the seizure threshold. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the kidney results in bicarbonate loss, which also carries sodium, water and potassium along with it. This causes urinary alkalinization and diuresis. TOXICOLOGY: CAI causes diuresis and bicarbonate loss and can result in electrolyte, metabolic, and renal disturbances. EPIDEMIOLOGY: CAI are an uncommon poisoning that rarely result in serious toxicity. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Confusion, metabolic acidosis, tachycardia, tachypnea electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia and hyperchloremia) can develop. SEVERE TOXICITY: Lethargy and severe metabolic acidosis can occur. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common adverse effects include: paresthesias, renal calculi, metabolic acidosis, bone marrow depression, and rashes. Other more rare adverse effects include: taste disturbances, ataxia, gastritis, cholestatic hepatitis, and renal failure. Some CAI agents like acetaZOLAMIDE are basic and may be implicated in extravasation injury. <br\/>"},{"id":"924710-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CARBONIC ANHYDRASE INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive care are usually sufficient for the treatment of mild to moderate toxicity. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive with careful attention to the airway if the patient becomes obtunded. Follow electrolytes closely and replace as these may become altered. Treat severe metabolic acidosis (pH greater than 7.1) with sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq\/kg in adults and children). This may be repeated as needed at one-half the original dose every 10 minutes. Monitor ABGs closely and titrate sodium bicarbonate meticulously. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Treat extravasation injury with warm compresses and elevation. Treat Stevens-Johns Syndrome with aggressive hydration and supportive care in an ICU setting.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Generally, decontamination is not indicated in the prehospital setting. HOSPITAL: Overdose is unlikely to cause severe intoxication, so activated charcoal is unnecessary. It can be used for massive ingestions or following a coingestant of concern as long as the patient can tolerate charcoal.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer 100% oxygen as needed for respiratory support. Intubate and provide assisted ventilation as necessary, rarely indicated.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis may be effective for the treatment of severe acetaZOLAMIDE overdose especially in the setting of renal failure, and can be used to correct severe acid base and electrolyte abnormalities, however there is no experience with the use of hemodialysis for CAI overdose and it would rarely be indicated.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes and renal function. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin, venous or arterial blood gas and urinalysis in symptomatic patients. Drug concentrations are usually not helpful in the acute setting or widely available. Consider checking acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations. If there is any uncertainty of drug ingested.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients may be observed at home for small unintentional ingestions and mild symptoms, but should be evaluated for any concerning symptoms. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient who manifests signs of mild toxicity (ie, confusion, tachycardia, or tachypnea) or a large or deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation. If symptoms resolve in the emergency department and the home social situation permits, the patient may be discharged after psychiatric clearance. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who present with severe symptoms (ie, lethargy, severe metabolic acidosis, bone marrow depression, cholestatic hepatitis, renal failure or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) should be admitted. In addition, if the above mild findings persist despite treatment in the emergency department, admit the patient to the appropriate level of care. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist as needed, especially for patients admitted to the ICU.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924710-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CARBONIC ANHYDRASE INHIBITORS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The acute toxic dose is not known.
