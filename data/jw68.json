Occasionally used as a drug of abuse for their hallucinogenic effects, primarily by adolescents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is common, but rarely severe. May occur via oral, parenteral or dermal (patches or cream) routes. PHARMACOLOGY: Antihistamines are competitive antagonists of histamine (H1 and H2) receptors. Second generation antihistamines tend to be less sedating as they do not cross the blood-brain barrier as readily as the first generation antihistamines. Decongestants are sympathomimetic agents that act as alpha agonists leading to decreased nasal congestion. TOXICOLOGY: Anticholinergic (primarily antimuscarinic) effects develop in overdose due to antagonism of central H1 receptors. Large overdoses of H1 blockers, particularly diphenhydramine, may cause sodium channel antagonism. Decongestants can lead to sympathomimetic (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia, hyperventilation, intercranial hemorrhage) symptoms. GENERAL: Severe overdose may cause hypertension, tachycardia, toxic psychosis, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, and\/or coma, and may occur as a result of either antihistamine or decongestant (sympathomimetic) toxicity. The antihistamine effects usually predominate over sympathomimetic effects in adult exposures; while either the antihistamine or sympathomimetic effects may predominate in pediatric exposures. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Somnolence, anticholinergic effects (i.e., mydriasis, flushing, fever, dry mouth, and decreased bowel sounds), tachycardia, mild hypertension, and nausea and vomiting are common after overdose. Agitation, confusion and hallucinations may develop with moderate poisoning. SEVERE POISONING: Severe effects may include agitated delirium, psychosis, seizures, coma, hypotension, QRS widening, and ventricular dysrhythmias, including torsades de pointe, but are generally only reported in adults after very large, deliberate ingestions. Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure may rarely develop in patients with prolonged agitation, coma or seizures. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: ANTIHISTAMINES: Mild sedation, dizziness, impaired coordination, and mild anticholinergic effects. Paradoxical excitation can develop in some patients. SYMPATHOMIMETICS: Hypertension, tachycardia, insomnia, anxiety, nervousness, and restlessness may occur.<br\/><\/li><li><b>ANTIHISTAMINES <\/b><br\/>USES: Antihistamines are used primarily to treat allergic reactions. Also used to treat pruritus, peripheral vertigo, and as a sleep aid. Occasionally used as a drug of abuse for their hallucinogenic effects, primarily by adolescents.

EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is common, particularly in patients with chronic opioid abuse, and can be life-threatening. PHARMACOLOGY: Codeine is an opioid, which is a group of chemical substances, naturally occurring and synthetic, that bind at the opiate receptor. Codeine is a naturally occurring compound derived from the poppy, Papaver somniferum. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting and pinpoint pupils. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE POISONING: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia. Death may result from any of these complications. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects with therapeutic administration of codeine include lightheadedness, dizziness, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, and sweating.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jw68s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANTIHISTAMINE\/DECONGESTANT <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The majority of antihistamine overdoses require only supportive care; give activated charcoal if patient presents shortly after ingestion; sedate with benzodiazepines for agitation and delirium. Hypertension and tachycardia are generally mild and well tolerated, and do not require specific treatment. Physostigmine can be used to establish a diagnosis, it may also help avoid an invasive, costly work-up, but should only be given in a setting where intensive monitoring and resuscitation are available. It should NOT be given if there is a history or ECG (QRS widening) evidence that suggests a tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early. Gastric lavage may be of benefit, if the patient presents soon after a large ingestion; administer activated charcoal as well. GI decontamination should be performed only in patients who can protect their airway or who are intubated. Severe delirium may develop and require large doses of benzodiazepines for sedation. Seizures (may rarely progress to status epilepticus) may require aggressive use of benzodiazepines, propofol and\/or barbiturates. Monitor for QRS widening and ventricular dysrhythmias; treat with intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, titrate to blood pH 7.45 to 7.55), or lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate unsuccessful. Monitor core temperature and treat hyperthermia with aggressive benzodiazepine sedation to control agitation and external cooling.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Codeine overdoses can be life-threatening. Activated charcoal should be considered early after a significant oral ingestion, if a patient can protect their airway and is without significant signs of toxicity. If a patient is displaying signs of moderate to severe toxicity, do NOT administer activated charcoal because of the risk of aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Codeine plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Obtain a baseline acetaminophen and salicylate levels in a patient with a suspected overdose. Routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of codeine toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children who have inadvertently taken more than a therapeutic dose for age and weight should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions and all children with ingestions of more than a therapeutic dose should be sent to a health care facility for observation for at least 4 hours, as peak plasma levels and symptoms will likely develop within this time period. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous depression should be admitted to the hospital. Patients needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as they may have taken a longer-acting opioid and may need additional doses. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, or delirium or those needing a naloxone infusion or intubated patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jw68s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANTIHISTAMINE\/DECONGESTANT<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Antihistamine toxicity is variable and unpredictable.
