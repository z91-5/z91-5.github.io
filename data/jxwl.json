Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an antineoplastic used in the management of carcinoma of the esophagus, head and neck, colon, rectum, breast, stomach, and pancreas. Topical fluorouracil is used to treat actinic and solar keratoses.  Capecitabine is a prodrug of fluorouracil, used in the treatment of colorectal cancer and metastatic breast cancer refractory to paclitaxel and anthracycline-containing chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy in patients with Dukes' C colon cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. PHARMACOLOGY: 5-Fluorouracil is a fluorinated pyrimidine antimetabolite which undergoes anabolic and catabolic reactions the same as uracil except it is converted to thymidine.  5-Fluorouracil, or fluorouracil, blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid and interferes with DNA synthesis and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of RNA. This creates a thymine deficiency resulting in cell death, especially in cells which grow more rapidly and take up fluorouracil rapidly. Capecitabine is a prodrug and is extensively metabolized to 5-FU. TOXICOLOGY: Fluorouracil effects rapidly dividing cells. In order to produce toxicity, fluorouracil must be metabolized into the compounds 5-fluorodeoxyurideine monophosphate and 5-fluorouracil triphosphate. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase is an enzyme used in the initial and rate-limiting step of pyrimidine (and 5-FU) catabolism. In rare cases, an inherited deficiency of dipyrimidine dehydrogenase activity has led to severe toxicity (eg, stomatitis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity) following therapeutic doses of 5-FU. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose of 5-FU is typically due to a medication error (ie, malfunction or incorrect programming of the intravenous pump) and is rare, but can be fatal, if it occurs. OVERDOSE: Effects are expected to be an extension of adverse effects reported with therapeutic use and may include: severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, and bone marrow depression (ie, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, sepsis). ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Early symptoms include anorexia, stomatitis, esophagopharyngitis, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. SEVERE: Major toxic effects result from myelosuppression. Clinical effects include palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. LESS COMMON: Other potentially severe events: neurologic toxicity (ie, mental status changes, ataxia and neuropathy), cardiogenic shock, and gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation can develop. There have been infrequent reports of hepatotoxicity, ileitis, rhabdomyolysis, pulmonary edema, hypokalemia, and seizures. CAPECITABINE: Dose-limiting toxicities with therapy can include gastrointestinal effects (ie, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), fatigue, dizziness, thrombocytopenia, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.<br\/>"},{"id":"jxwls12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FLUOROURACIL AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Early symptoms are likely nausea and vomiting. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with saline or bicarbonate. For moderate symptoms, consider adding oral anesthetics (lidocaine, benzocaine or diphenhydramine). Treat patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate diarrhea (Grade 1 or 2) without signs of infection with loperamide. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. SEVERE TOXICITY: ANTIDOTE: Uridine triacetate, a prodrug of uridine, has been granted orphan-drug status by the FDA as an antidote to treat fluorouracil poisoning. To obtain uridine triacetate, healthcare professionals can contact the Wellstat Therapeutics 24 hours\/day, 7 days\/week by calling the severe adverse event hotline: (443)-831-5626.  In adults, it is administered at a dose of 10 g every 6 hours for 20 doses. Treat severe mucositis with oral anesthetics and systemic analgesics (eg, morphine) and consider topical or systemic antibiotics if infection is suspected. Use sialagogues (eg, bethanechol) for severe salivary gland dysfunction.  Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Treat patients presenting with progressive and uncontrolled diarrhea with octreotide, IV fluids, electrolyte replacement, and antibiotics. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Ingestion: Activated charcoal should be used if exposure is via oral tablets of capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a parenteral product and prehospital decontamination would not be beneficial. Wash exposed skin with soap and water. HOSPITAL: Ingestion: Activated charcoal should be used if exposure is via oral tablets of capecitabine (prodrug of fluorouracil). GI decontamination is not indicated after parenteral fluorouracil exposure. Wash exposed skin with soap and water.<\/li><li>Antidote: As of May 2009, uridine triacetate (formerly known as vistonuridine), a prodrug of uridine, has been granted orphan-drug status by the FDA as an antidote in the treatment of fluorouracil poisoning. In adults, it is administered at a dose of 10 g every 6 hours for 20 doses as soon as possible after 5-FU overdose. To obtain uridine triacetate, healthcare professionals can contact the Wellstat Therapeutics 24 hours\/day, 7 days\/week by calling the severe adverse event hotline: (443)-831-5626. There are no report of uridine triacetate use after capecitabine overdose, but it would be expected to be effective.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Leukopenia accompanies every course of therapy with fluorouracil with peak effects at 7 to 14 days postexposure. Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours OR 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day SubQ once daily. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Diarrhea: Patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate diarrhea (Grade 1 or 2) without signs of infection, treat with loperamide 2 mg every 4 hours for 24 hours. Patients presenting with progressive and uncontrolled diarrhea treat with octreotide, IV fluids, electrolyte replacement, and antibiotics.<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with a fluorouracil overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Fluorouracil has been classified as an irritant by one source and another classifies it as a neutral agent. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Elevate the affected area. Apply ice packs for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily.  Another source recommended warm\/heat compresses for local reaction. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable).  Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports of intrathecal injection with fluorouracil are available. This information was derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative-free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor daily CBC with differential to detect bone marrow depression. Leukopenia accompanies every course of therapy with fluorouracil. Nadirs in circulating white blood cells are typically reached between the 9th and 14th day after therapy, maximal depression may be seen as late as 20 days after therapy. By day 30, WBC should return to normal range. Patients with overdose of fluorouracil should be hematologically monitored for a minimum of 4 weeks after exposure. Monitor patient for signs of bleeding. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Closely monitor electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic enzymes. Initiate continuous ECG monitoring in cases of severe overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis may be of benefit in overdoses with capecitabine (prodrug of fluorouracil) in reducing the amount of 5'-DFUR, a low molecular weight metabolite of the parent compound. Dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit in the overdose of intravenous fluorouracil due to large volume of distribution. Circulating levels of fluorouracil are undetectable within 3 hours of injection.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients who have had a known overdose of fluorouracil MUST seek medical attention so the antidote can be administered as soon as possible. Home management of exposure to any fluorouracil formulation (IV, oral or topical) is not appropriate. Only patients who have been exposed to therapeutic doses and have mild symptoms of toxicity (ie, Grade 1 uncomplicated diarrhea or Grade 1 nausea\/vomiting) may be managed at home under the supervision of their oncologist. Patients with new or worsening symptoms must seek medical attention. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admit patients with known overdose for treatment and monitoring. Patients who have received therapeutic doses and are hemodynamically unstable, require IV fluids and electrolyte replacement secondary to progressive, complicated chemotherapy induced diarrhea or treatment resistent nausea or vomiting, and\/or patients who are at a severe risk of infection must be admitted to the hospital for supportive care. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or a poison center for assistance in managing patients with fluorouracil overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or profound neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxwls12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>FLUOROURACIL AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Severe toxicity and some deaths have been reported with 5-FU doses of 20 to 25 mg\/kg.  In a review of 33 patients with inadvertent fluorouracil overdoses not treated with uridine triacetate, 29 patients who died received doses ranging from 1000 mg to 27200 mg of fluorouracil. Patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency may develop severe toxicity at therapeutic doses. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: CAPECITABINE: The recommended dose for chemotherapy is 2500 mg\/m(2) orally daily in 2 divided doses for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week off, and repeated in 3-week cycles.

FLOXURIDINE: Recommended dose by continuous arterial infusion is 0.1 to 0.6 mg\/kg\/day. Higher dose ranges of 0.4 mg to 0.6 mg are usually used for hepatic artery infusion because the drug is metabolized by the liver, reducing the potential for systemic toxicity. <br\/>"}]}}}
