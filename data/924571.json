COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl- L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contains a catechol structure . Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites . The function of COMT is to eliminate biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites . In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme (for levodopa) that catalyzes the metabolism to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy- L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and peripheral tissues . Although the precise mechanism of action of tolcapone is not known, it is believed to be related to its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa . Administration of tolcapone in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, produces more sustained plasma levels of levodopa than administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone . These sustained plasma levels of levodopa may result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to increased therapeutic effects on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, as well as increased adverse effects; a decrease in the levodopa dosage may be required . <br\/>"},{"id":"924571-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"924571-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Rapidly absorbed;<\/li><li>Bioavailability: 65%; food decreases bioavailability 10 to 20%<\/li><\/ul>"},"1":{"id":"924571-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 9 L <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"924571-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Renal: 60%; 0.5% unchanged; Fecal 40% <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"924571-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 2 to 3 h<br\/>"}}},{"id":"924571-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>may be taken with or without food <br\/>"},{"id":"924571-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>symptomatic improvement of Parkinson disease should be seen within 3 weeks of therapy initiation<\/li><li>liver enzymes (eg, ALT and AST) and signs of emergent liver injury; before initiation of therapy and before dose increases, every 2 to 4 weeks for 6 months following initiation or dose increases, then periodically at clinically relevant intervals thereafter; more frequent monitoring may increase the possibility of early detection of hepatocellular injury but may not prevent the occurrence of fulminant liver failure<\/li><li>somnolence; at baseline and new or increasing symptoms with specific activities (eg, driving, talking, eating)<\/li><li>compulsive behaviors; new or increasing (eg, gambling, eating, sex, shopping)<\/li><li>dermatological examinations; periodically for development of melanoma<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924571-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 100 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Tasmar<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 100 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924571-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"924571-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>COMT INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/>USES: Tolcapone and entacapone are used with levodopa\/carbidopa to treat signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson disease. PHARMACOLOGY: Entacapone and tolcapone are selective and reversible inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). They block the COMT in peripheral tissues, thus preventing elimination of catecholamines and other hydroxylated metabolites, including levodopa. This activity results in greater and more sustained plasma levels of levodopa, leading to a more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. In a study, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness occurred in elderly volunteers after ingesting 800 mg 3 times daily of tolcapone. In studies, abdominal pain and loose stools were the most commonly reported adverse effects in patients receiving entacapone 800 mg 3 times daily for 7 days. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported following treatment with COMT inhibitors: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, anorexia, xerostomia, urine discoloration, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, dyskinesia, dystonia, akathisia, insomnia, drowsiness, headache, confusion, dizziness, hallucinations, increased sweating, rhabdomyolysis, paresthesia, dyspnea, sleep disorder, excessive dreaming, and elevated liver enzymes. Fatal liver damage has been reported following therapeutic use of tolcapone. A neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like complex has been reported in association with the abrupt dose reduction or withdrawal of these agents. <br\/>"},{"id":"924571-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>COMT INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. NOTE: Vasopressors should only be used with caution in patients with symptomatic hypotension unresponsive to fluids and supine position, as COMT inhibitors may interfere with the metabolism of agents such as dopamine and norepinephrine and cause exaggerated or prolonged response. Manage dystonic reactions with anticholinergic agents (diphenhydramine, benztropine) or benzodiazepines.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the risk of aspiration secondary to CNS depression and dyskinesias.
