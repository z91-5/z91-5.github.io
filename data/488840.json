It may be used to lessen symptoms of hyperthyroidism in preparation for surgery or radioactive iodine therapy in patients intolerant of methimazole. PHARMACOLOGY: Propylthiouracil is a thiocarbamide compound that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones as an effective therapy for hyperthyroidism. However, it neither affects the stored thyroxine and triiodothyronine in the thyroid or bloodstream, nor interferes with the thyroid hormone activity when administered orally or parenterally. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Very little data are available on the effects of acute overdose.  Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, headache, fever, arthralgia, pruritus, edema, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis may occur with overdose. Other rare effects include exfoliative dermatitis, hepatitis, neuropathies, or CNS simulation or depression. Chronic overdose may result in clinical hypothyroidism. Decreased T3 and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were the only effects seen after a massive overdose in a 12-year-old girl. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects following the therapeutic use of propylthiouracil include rash, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, arthralgia, paresthesias, loss of taste, taste perversion, abnormal loss of hair, myalgia, headache, pruritus, drowsiness, neuritis, edema, vertigo, skin pigmentation, jaundice, sialadenopathy, and lymphadenopathy. Serious adverse effects include liver injury, hepatitis, liver failure, agranulocytosis, granulopenia, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, drug fever, a lupus-like syndrome (including splenomegaly and vasculitis), hepatitis, periarteritis, hypoprothrombinemia, nephritis, glomerulonephritis, interstitial pneumonitis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and vasculitis syndrome. Vasculitis syndrome associated with the presence of anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) is manifested as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (crescentic and pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis), and may cause acute renal failure, pulmonary infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage, skin ulcers, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. <br\/>"},{"id":"488840-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PROPYLTHIOURACIL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Myelosuppression has been reported. Monitor serial CBC with differential.

Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count, renal function, liver enzymes, and serum electrolytes in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe symptoms despite treatment should be admitted.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a regional poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"488840-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PROPYLTHIOURACIL <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Limited data are available.
