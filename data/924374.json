Minoxidil is also used to treat hair loss. PHARMACOLOGY: Hydralazine, diazoxide and minoxidil cause vasodilation by directly relaxing vascular smooth muscle. Iloprost is a prostacyclin PGI(2) analog that dilates pulmonary and systemic arteries. Fenoldopam is a D1 dopamine receptor agonist. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicity is generally an extension of the pharmacological effect, primarily hypotension. Hydralazine has an active metabolite that binds to cellular proteins and may trigger an autoimmune response. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are uncommon and deaths are extremely rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: All of these medications cause dose-related hypotension following overdose, often accompanied by tachycardia. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hydralazine: One case of electrocardiographic changes suggesting myocardial ischemia and acidosis without profound hypotension has been reported following hydralazine overdose. Diazoxide: A case of 2:1 heartblock has been reported following rapid IV injection. Minoxidil: Profound hypotension and myocardial ischemia have been reported following large overdoses. Fenoldopam: No reports of significant toxicity.    ADVERSE EFFECTS: All of these agents will cause a dose-related decrease in blood pressure. ADVERSE EFFECTS BY AGENT: Hydralazine: lupus-like syndrome, auto-immune dermal, liver and renal disease. Diazoxide: Hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar coma. Minoxidil: Hair growth. Fenoldopam: Tachycardia. <br\/>"},{"id":"924374-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VASODILATORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Administer IV fluids for hypotension. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is rare following overdoses of these medications. Patients who remain hypotensive after fluid boluses should be treated with adrenergic vasopressors. Some authors suggest that phenylephrine may reverse hypotension without causing tachycardia. In cases of severe toxicity, consider coingestion or other medical conditions as a cause of the symptoms.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Decontamination is not recommended. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after large, recent ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be required following overdose.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote for poisoning from these medications.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV NS 10-20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine<\/li><li>Wide QRS complex: DYSRHYTHMIAS may respond to serum alkalinization, or lidocaine, bretylium, phenytoin.<\/li><li>Seizure: IV benzodiazepines or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. No specific lab work is needed in most patients. Drug concentration monitoring is not clinically useful or readily available. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. Monitor for seizure activity and CNS depression, especially in buflomedil overdoses.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Studies suggest that diazoxide and minoxidil clearance may be increased by dialysis, but there is no evidence suggesting that increased clearance improves outcomes and the vast majority of patients do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Children and adults can be managed at  home if overdose was inadvertent, was less than 2 times the therapeutic dose for their weight, and no signs or symptoms are present. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions or ingestions of more than twice the therapeutic dose for weight should be sent to a health care facility for 6 hours of observation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop persistent hypotension should be admitted until symptoms resolve. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in decision making whether or not admission is advisable, managing patients with severe toxicity, or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924374-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>VASODILATORS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is very rare following isolated overdose from these medications.
