EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are common, but toxicity is generally mild. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents inhibit angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE), thus preventing conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone secretion (aldosterone suppression reduces sodium and water retention). ACE inhibitors also prevent the breakdown of bradykinin (a potent vasodilator). The net result is vasodilatation, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, decreased blood pressure, increased cardiac output, and a relative increase in renal, cerebral, and coronary blood flow. TOXICOLOGY: The toxic effect of an ACE inhibitor is an extension of its pharmacologic effect. The elevation in bradykinin concentration appears to be the primary cause of both ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and cough. ACE inhibitors may also inhibit the metabolism of enkephalins and potentiate their opioid effect, which includes lowering blood pressure. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild hypotension. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, bradycardia, and renal failure. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Dry cough, hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency in patients with renal artery stenosis, maculopapular rash, angioneurotic edema, neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity. <br\/>"},{"id":"2a2bs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ACE INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients will have no symptoms, but patients with mild orthostatic hypotension can be treated by remaining prone. Those who remain hypotensive can be treated with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if the patient presents with circulatory collapse. Correct severe hyperkalemia using standard treatments such as glucose, insulin, calcium, sodium bicarbonate, sodium polystyrene sulfate and hemodialysis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: As severe toxicity is very rare, prehospital decontamination is generally not recommended. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient presents early after large ingestion, with appropriate level of consciousness, patent airway, and can drink the charcoal. Gastric lavage is generally not necessary as life threatening toxicity is rare.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who have severe angioedema may require fiber optic or surgical airway procedures.<\/li><li>Antidote: Angiotensin infusion at doses ranging from 8.5 to 18 mcg\/minute has been successful in reversing hypotension in patients who did not respond to volume and pressor infusions, but is not available in the United States.<\/li><li>Naloxone: Although the role of naloxone in the setting of ACE inhibitor overdose remains unclear, it may be considered especially in cases of severe hypotension where fluid overload is a concern. The dose of naloxone should be administered in titrated doses starting with 0.2 to 2 mg IV repeated every 2 to 3 minutes to improve blood pressure; maximum dose 8 mg. Pediatrics: 0.01 to 0.1 mg\/kg, repeated every 2 to 3 minutes as needed.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor blood pressure, continuous cardiac monitoring, electrolytes, renal function, ECG and urinalysis in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: ACE inhibitors are dialyzable, but hemodialysis is not used because supportive care is usually effective.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  Pediatric patients can be observed at home if they have ingested less than 2 times the defined daily dose (DDD) of an ACE inhibitor and they remain asymptomatic. The DDD of specific ACE inhibitors are as follows: Captopril: 50 mg; Enalapril: 10 mg; Fosinopril: 15 mg; Lisinopril: 10 mg; Perindopril: 4 mg; Ramipril: 2.5 mg; Trandolapril: 2 mg. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions, and children who are symptomatic, or who have ingested at least 2 times the defined daily dose (DDD) of an ACE inhibitor should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation and evaluation. The DDD of specific ACE inhibitors are as follows: Captopril: 50 mg; Enalapril: 10 mg; Fosinopril: 15 mg; Lisinopril: 10 mg; Perindopril: 4 mg; Ramipril: 2.5 mg; Trandolapril: 2 mg. Patients who are asymptomatic 6 hours after ingestion can be discharged (after psychiatric evaluation as appropriate). ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic or hypotensive patients should be admitted to a monitored bed.
