PHARMACOLOGY: Rifapentine is a cyclopentyl rifamycin derivative antibiotic with bactericidal activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon. OVERDOSE: Information is limited.  Administration of 1200 mg as a single oral dose resulted in minor adverse effects including heartburn, headache and increased urinary frequency. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgias, rash and elevated liver enzymes can develop. Red-orange discoloration of the skin, body tissues and fluids may occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hepatotoxicity, hyperbilirubinemia, and hematologic toxicity may develop following a significant exposure. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Red-orange discoloration of body tissues and fluids, including skin, teeth, tongue, urine, feces, saliva, sweat and tears, may commonly occur with therapy.  Other reported adverse effects or alterations in laboratory studies include: elevated liver enzyme levels, neutropenia, anemia, lymphopenia, hematuria, proteinuria, hypoglycemia, arthralgias and rash.<br\/>"},{"id":"924809-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RIFAPENTINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited overdose information. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Trean persistent vomiting with IV fluids and antiemetics. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Hepatotoxicity has been associated with antituberculous therapy; monitor liver enzymes and assess for hepatic injury following a significant exposure until there is evidence of patient recovery. Monitor CBC with differential; repeat as indicated. Hematologic toxicity (ie, neutropenia, anemia) may develop following a significant exposure. Treat vomiting with IV fluids and antiemetics.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Decontamination is unlikely to be necessary following a minor exposure. Consider activated charcoal if a significant recent ingestion or if coingestants are suspected. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal, if the ingestion is relatively recent and the patient is alert and able to protect their airway. Repeat administration of activated charcoal may be beneficial since rifamycin antibiotics undergo enterohepatic circulation. However, there are no clinical trials documenting the efficacy of this procedure.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary following mild to moderate toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor CBC with differential and liver enzyme concentrations following a significant exposure. Obtain a baseline urinalysis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Rifapentine and its metabolite, 25-desacetyl rifapentine, are highly protein-bound, hemodialysis is not expected to be of any benefit following an overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child that has a minor ingestion (1 tablet) can likely be managed at home with adult supervision. An asymptomatic adult or complaint of minor symptoms that has taken an extra dose or has taken rifapentine for several consecutive days inadvertently can likely be managed at home with telephone support. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients and those with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients may be discharged to home once symptoms have resolved and laboratory studies are within normal limits. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent symptoms may need to be admitted for further treatment.
