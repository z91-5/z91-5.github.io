PHARMACOLOGY: Capreomycin is a cyclic polypeptide antimicrobial agent, isolated from Streptomyces capreolus, administered as a mixture of capreomycin IA and capreomycin IB, and active against strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is extremely rare. TOXICITY: There have been no reports of capreomycin overdose; however, overdose effects are anticipated to be an exaggeration of the adverse effects associated with therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances (ie, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), ototoxicity, leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic alkalosis, injection site reaction, and hypersensitivity reactions are the most common adverse effects. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis may occur with therapeutic use following rapid intravenous infusion and\/or with large intravenous doses.<br\/>"},{"id":"106006-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CAPREOMYCIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Maintain good urine output (3 to 5 mL\/kg\/hr) with IV fluids.

Monitor CBC and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Perform auditory testing and vestibular function testing in patients with auditory symptoms. Perform an ophthalmologic examination in patients with visual symptoms (eye pain, changes in visual acuity, etc.). Serum capreomycin concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis clearance up to 2.6 L\/hr has been reported, and may be useful following a massive overdose or in patients with significant renal impairment<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management as capreomycin is generally only used in the hospital setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with significant overdose should have serum electrolyte and renal function monitoring and auditory testing performed.
