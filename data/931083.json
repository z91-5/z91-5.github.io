PHARMACOLOGY: The precise mechanism of action of pirfenidone, a pyridone, has not been established. However, pirfenidone's ability to interfere with TNF-alpha in human astrocytes may prove useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. No adverse effects were reported after patients received up to 4005 mg\/day of pirfenidone. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (10% OR GREATER): Nausea, rash, abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dyspepsia, dizziness, vomiting, anorexia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sinusitis, insomnia, decreased weight, and arthralgia. OTHER EFFECTS: Angioedema, photosensitivity reactions, agranulocytosis, elevated ALT and AST concentrations, and elevated bilirubin concentration. DRUG INTERACTION: Coadministration of pirfenidone (a CYP1A2 substrate) with moderate (eg, ciprofloxacin) and strong inhibitors (eg, fluvoxamine, enoxacin) of CYP1A2 may increase pirfenidone plasma concentration, resulting in toxicity. <br\/>"},{"id":"931083-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PIRFENIDONE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable.
