Follitropin beta is a recombinant FSH. In females, follitropin beta stimulates follicular growth, maturation, and gonadal steroid production. Follitropin beta stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure. When follicular development has been achieved after treatment with follitropin beta, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) must be administered to these women in order to effect the final phase of follicle maturation. In males, FSH (the active component of follistim beta) is the pituitary hormone responsible for spermatogenesis. Follitropin beta, therefore, stimulates spermatogenesis in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism when given with hCG.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jt90s8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"jt90s8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Bioavailability, SubQ\/IM: 77.8%\/76.4%<\/li><li>Tmax, IM, 27 +\/- 5.4 hr<\/li><\/ul>"},"1":{"id":"jt90s8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: approximately 8 L <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"jt90s8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Total body clearance: 0.013 to 0.014 L\/hr\/kg (Japanese and European women, respectively)<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"jt90s8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"27 to 44 hr <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"jt90s9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>General Information<\/b><br\/><ul><li>allow drug to reach room temperature before injecting to avoid discomfort<\/li><li>Follistim(R) AQ can be given as an IM or subQ injection<\/li><li>Follistim(R) AQ Cartridge with pen injector can only be given subQ<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jt90s10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>ovulation induction: serum estradiol levels and ultrasound; at weekly intervals to determine follicle maturation, an adequate ovarian response, and the need for continued treatment<\/li><li>assisted reproductive technology: serum estradiol levels and ultrasound; following the first 4 days of treatment, at an individualized frequency to determine follicle maturation, an adequate ovarian response, and the need for continued treatment<\/li><li>ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technology: increases in urinary or serum luteinizing hormone and serum progesterone, sonographic evidence of collapsed follicle, fluid in the cul-de-sac, and corpus luteum formation indicates ovulation<\/li><li>ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technology: HCG level to confirm intrauterine pregnancy and rule out ectopic pregnancy<\/li><li>induction of spermatogenesis: serum testosterone levels following human chorionic gonadotropin administration and analysis of semen for evidence of spermatogenesis; an increase in sperm density may indicate efficacy<\/li><li>serum estradiol levels; excessive ovarian stimulation<\/li><li>symptoms of excessive ovarian syndrome every other day during treatment and for 2 weeks following treatment with follitropin beta<\/li><li>ultrasound; to detect ectopic pregnancy, to detect multifetal gestations, to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and abnormal ovarian enlargement<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jt90s11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Follistim AQ<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Injection Solution: 75 IU\/0.5 ML, 150 IU\/0.5 ML<\/li><li>Subcutaneous Solution: 300 IU\/0.36 ML, 600 IU\/0.72 ML, 900 IU\/1.08 ML<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"jt90s13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Inform female patients that this drug may cause multiple births.<\/li><li>Inform female patients this drug may cause headache, injection site reaction, ovarian cysts, and abdominal pain and discomfort.<\/li><li>Inform male patients this drug may cause headache, injection site pain or reactions, breast enlargement, acne, and rash.<\/li><li>Advise female patient to report signs\/symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (abdominal bloating\/distension, lower abdominal pain, severe pelvic pain, dyspnea, decreased urination) during and 2 weeks posttreatment.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of pulmonary or vascular problems such as thromboembolic disorder, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or atelectasis.<\/li><li>If self-administered, teach patient proper technique and placement of injections.<\/li><li>Advise patient to rotate injection sites.<\/li><li>Advise patient if a dose is missed, it should not be doubled at the next administration and inform their healthcare provider regarding further dosing instructions.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
