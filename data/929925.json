PHARMACOLOGY: Vilazodone is thought to act within the CNS to enhance serotonergic activity via selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake. Vilazodone is also a partial agonist of serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Limited data. Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Serotonin syndrome, lethargy, restlessness, hallucinations and disorientation have been reported in several cases of overdose (at doses of 200 to 280 mg) with vilazodone. Other manifestations of serotonin syndrome can include akathisia, tremor, altered mental status, inducible clonus, sustained clonus, muscular hypertonicity, and hyperthermia. The classic clinical triad is altered mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities (rigidity), and autonomic instability (eg, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia). Seizure activity and altered mental status were reported in a toddler following an inadvertent exposure to vilazodone. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea and nausea. LESS COMMON: Dry mouth, vomiting, dizziness and insomnia. <br\/>"},{"id":"929925-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VILAZODONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients require only supportive care. Control agitation and confusion with benzodiazepines (first-line therapy). Hypertension and tachycardia are generally mild and well tolerated, and do not require specific treatment. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: SEROTONIN SYNDROME: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Provide therapy as above, but patients with severe toxicity (eg severe hyperthermia and agitation) may need immediate aggressive sedation, intubation, and neuromuscular paralysis. Control agitation with aggressive benzodiazepine use, consider cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine. Administer fluids and direct-acting vasopressors (eg, norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine) for hypotension. Use nitroprusside or esmolol for hypertension that is refractory to benzodiazepines. Manage hyperthermia by controlling muscle hyperactivity with benzodiazepines and nondepolarizing paralytics as well as external cooling. DYSRHYTHMIAS: Monitor cardiac rhythm. Patients with wide-complex dysrhythmias should be treated with hypertonic sodium bicarbonate boluses. Although QTc interval prolongation has been reported with other SSRIs, it has NOT been observed with vilazodone.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is not recommended because of the potential risk for somnolence and\/or seizures. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patients presents soon after a large ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. In the case of significant CNS depression, perform orotracheal intubation for airway protection prior to giving charcoal.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early, if the patient presents with neuromuscular paralysis or if the patient has evidence of respiratory or CNS depression and unable to protect their airway, severe muscle rigidity, or severe hyperthermia.<\/li><li>Psychomotor agitation: Give IV benzodiazepines (liberally), barbiturates as needed.<\/li><li>Seizure: IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or propofol for recurrent seizures.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Primary treatment is sedation with IV benzodiazepines, and cooling measures. CYPROHEPTADINE: A serotonin antagonist with high affinity for the 5-HT2 receptors; effective for milder cases of serotonin syndrome. Dose: ADULT: 12 mg orally or nasogastric tube, followed by 4 to 8 mg every 4 to 6 hours. CHILD: 0.25 mg\/kg\/day orally or nasogastric tube divided every 6 hours, maximum dose 12 mg\/day. CHLORPROMAZINE: A phenothiazine antipsychotic with 5-HT2 antagonist activity; indicated in severe serotonin syndrome cases. Dose: 12.5 to 50 mg IV, followed by 25 to 50 mg every 6 hours. It is NOT generally recommended because it may cause severe hypotension. Severe cases have been managed with benzodiazepine sedation and neuromuscular paralysis with nondepolarizing agents.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine laboratory studies may not be necessary following a minor exposure. If the patient develops significant fluid loss (eg, vomiting and\/or diarrhea), monitor electrolytes and volume status. Monitor vital signs (including temperature) and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes sodium in patients with significant overdose. Obtain baseline ECG, continuous cardiac monitoring, and serial ECGs following a significant exposure. Monitor serial neurologic exams for evidence of serotonergic excess (altered mental status, hyperreflexia, clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, seizures). Plasma concentration is not readily available and does not correlate well with therapeutic or adverse effects. It is not indicated for the acute management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are NOT of value due to the large volume of distribution and highly protein bound.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child with a minor (40 mg or less) inadvertent ingestion may be monitored at home. Based on limited data, children with a larger ingestion (greater than 40 mg) should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. An asymptomatic adult or those with mild toxicity following an isolated unintentional acute ingestion of less than 200 mg may be observed at home with instructions to go to a healthcare facility, if symptoms develop. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients and those with ingestions of more than 200 mg should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and observed for 6 to 12 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent toxicity after 6 to 12 hours should be admitted. Patients with severe toxicity may need to be admitted to an intensive care unit.
