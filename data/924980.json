PHARMACOLOGY: Decreases hepatic glucose production. Increases insulin sensitivity in the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and increases glucose uptake into adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after an acute overdose, although it has been reported after therapeutic use in patients also taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Mechanism of fluid retention and hepatotoxicity not elucidated. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common, rarely resulting in toxicity. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited human data, although hypoglycemia has been reported in clinical trials and animal studies. SEVERE TOXICITY: Minimal human data. Peripheral edema, congestive heart failure and hepatotoxicity have been reported after chronic therapy, but not after acute overdose. Its anticipated that effects may be similar to adverse effects reported during therapeutic use. ADVERSE EFFECTS: THIAZOLIDINEDIONES: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight gain, hypotension, hypertension, macular edema, edema, transaminitis, anemia, loss of bone density and hypersensitivity reactions can occur. SEVERE EFFECTS: Liver failure, bladder tumors, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, bladder tumors and Stevens-Johnson syndrome can develop. PIOGLITAZONE: The following have occurred with therapy: edema, hypoglycemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, paresthesia, and elevations of creatine phosphokinase. ROSIGLITAZONE: Headache, respiratory tract infection, fluid retention, weight gain, anemia, hepatic failure and hepatocellular injury have been reported. Based on previous postmarketing experience, myocardial ischemic events were associated with angina or myocardial infarction. In 2013, the FDA determined that rosiglitazone does not produce an increase risk of myocardial infarction compared to other antidiabetic (ie, metformin and sulfonylurea) agents. Limitations on prescribing and dispensing recommendations have been removed. However, ongoing monitoring of rosiglitazone will continue to assess and evaluate for any increase in myocardial ischemic events. TROGLITAZONE: As of 2000, troglitazone has been removed from the US market due to reports of severe hepatotoxicity. <br\/>"},{"id":"924980-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>THIAZOLIDINEDIONE ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive care is the mainstay of treatment in patients who present with mild to moderate thiazolidinedione toxicity. If hypoglycemia develops, coingestion of other hypoglycemic agents should be considered. Hypoglycemia with thiazolidinediones is uncommon, but they are often prescribed with other antidiabetic agents that can produce hypoglycemia. A 4 to 6 hour observation period is reasonable. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Early positive pressure ventilation\/intubation should be performed if the patient presents with pulmonary edema. Consider diuresis in massive fluid overload. Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if a patient presents with circulatory collapse.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered after a large ingestion, if the patient is alert and cooperative and able to protect their airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient presents early after a large ingestion and the airway is protected. Lavage is of limited benefit.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe symptoms who present with respiratory insufficiency, consider positive pressure ventilation if tolerated.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote. If hypoglycemia occurs, treat with IV dextrose.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain a baseline blood glucose level and monitor frequently; especially when coadministered with other antidiabetic agents. Monitor hepatic enzymes following a significant overdose. Monitor vital signs, blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte status as indicated. Plasma volume expansion has been reported which may exacerbate heart failure.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is ineffective because of extensive protein binding and large volume of distribution of these agents.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic individuals with acute inadvertent ingestions may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: A 4 to 6 hour observation period is recommended after a large or deliberate thiazolidinedione overdose. Patients who remain asymptomatic during this period with no hypoglycemia may be discharged home after appropriate psychiatric clearance as indicated. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe liver injury or evidence of fluid overload should be admitted.
