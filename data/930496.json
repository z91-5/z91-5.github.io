Vitamin K antagonist therapy depletes vitamin K-dependent factor synthesis and function by blocking carboxylation of glutamic acid residues during synthesis of these factors in the liver. The coagulation cascade contains a series of pro-coagulant and antithrombotic reactions. The components in prothrombin complex concentrate, human, affect the coagulation cascade at various steps. Coagulation factor II (prothrombin) is converted to thrombin by activated factor X in the presence of calcium ions, factor V, and phospholipids. thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin in clot formation. Factor VII is converted to its active form and activates factor IX, initiating the primary coagulation pathway. Factor IX (Christmas factor) is activated by activated factor VII and activated factor XI. Activated factor IX and activated factor VIII activates factor X. Factor X (Stuart-Prower factor) is activated by either activated factor VII or activated factor VIII and factor IX complex; activated factor X forms a complex with activated factor V that converts prothrombin to thrombin. Protein C is activated by thrombin thereby exerting an antithrombotic effect via inhibition of activated factors V and VIII decreasing thrombin formation; protein C also has indirect profibrinolytic activity by inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Protein S in free form exhibits antithrombotic effects by acting as a cofactor for activated protein C by inactivation of activated factors V and VIII.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"930496-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"930496-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Factor II, Vd: 71 mL\/kg<\/li><li>Factor VII, Vd: 41.8 mL\/kg<\/li><li>Factor IX, Vd: 92.4 mL\/kg<\/li><li>Factor X, Vd: 56.1 mL\/kg<\/li><li>Protein C, Vd: 62.9 mL\/kg<\/li><li>Protein S, Vd: 76.6 mL\/kg<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"930496-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Factor II, Total body clearance: 0.97 mL\/kg x hr<\/li><li>Factor VII, Total body clearance: 7.06 mL\/kg x hr<\/li><li>Factor IX, Total body clearance: 3.63 mL\/kg x hr<\/li><li>Factor X, Total body clearance: 1.25 mL\/kg x hr<\/li><li>Protein C, Total body clearance: 1.1 mL\/kg x hr<\/li><li>Protein S, Total body clearance: 1.1 mL\/kg x hr<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"930496-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Factor II, 59.7 hours<\/li><li>Factor VII, 4.2 hours<\/li><li>Factor IX, 16.7 hours<\/li><li>Factor X, 30.7 hours<\/li><li>Protein C, 47.2 hours<\/li><li>Protein S, 49.1 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"930496-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute with 20 mL (500 units kit) or 40 mL (1000 units kit) of provided diluent; administer within 4 hours of reconstitution<\/li><li>may pool multiple reconstituted vials together for larger doses<\/li><li>discard partially used vials; for single use only<\/li><li>infuse at room temperature at a rate of 0.12 mL\/kg\/min, up to maximum rate of 8.4 mL\/\/min; use a separate infusion line and do not mix with other medicinal products<\/li><li>record lot number in patient's medical record<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"930496-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>INR; baseline, during and after treatment<\/li><li>clinical response; during and after treatment<\/li><li>thromboembolic complications; during and after treatment<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"930496-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Kcentra<\/b><br\/>  Kit: 1 IU<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"930496-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Advise patient to report symptoms of stroke, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis.<\/li><li>Drug may cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and hypotension.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
