It is also indicated in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is anthracycline- and taxane-resistant. PHARMACOLOGY: Ixabepilone, an epothilone B analog, is an antimicrotubule agent. Ixabepilone inhibits microtubules, halting cell division in the mitotic phase and resulting in subsequent cell death. Ixabepilone stabilizes the microtubules by directly binding to the beta-tubulin subunits (alpha-beta-II and alpha-beta-III). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. In general, overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain\/myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and stomatitis) have been reported after the inadvertent administration of up to 100 mg\/m(2) of ixabepilone. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (20% or greater): Peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue\/asthenia, myalgia\/arthralgia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis\/mucositis, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain. OTHER EFFECTS (20% or greater, occurring in combination with capecitabine): Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, anorexia, abdominal pain, nail disorder, and constipation. HEMATOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES (40% or greater): Neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Other potentially serious events with therapeutic use: left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia and hypersensitivity reaction.<br\/>"},{"id":"928899-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IXABEPILONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting.  MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) in patients who develop severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia or anemia.  In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required. <\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports of intrathecal injection of ixabepilone are available. This information was derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP\/liter normal saline or lactated ringers) or 5% albumin have also been used for perfusion, and may be useful because of the high degree of protein binding of ixabepilone. Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; ixabepilone is only available parenterally.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors if patients develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. In patients with an ixabepilone overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status in symptomatic patients. Monitor for symptoms of burning sensation, paresthesia, discomfort or neuropathic pain. Nerve conduction studies may be useful. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelet count. In patients with neutropenia, monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with prolonged vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA:  Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with an overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928899-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>IXABEPILONE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Limited overdose data exists.
