Azelastine and bepotastine ophthalmic solutions are used to treat itching of the eyes associated with allergic conjunctivitis. PHARMACOLOGY: Azelastine and bepotastine are histamine H1-receptor antagonist. They are inhibitors of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (eg, mast cells) involved in the allergic response. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are also expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects. AZELASTINE: Since each bottle of a nasal spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride (Astelin(R)), acute overdose in adults is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse events, other than increased somnolence. In studies, adults did not experience increased incidence of serious adverse events following single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg). ADVERSE EFFECTS: AZELASTINE: NASAL: MOST COMMON: Bitter taste, nasal discomfort\/burning, headache, epistaxis, sneezing, sinusitis, and somnolence. OTHER EFFECTS: Rash, nasopharyngitis, weight gain, dry mouth, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, dryness of the nose, fatigue, cough, rhinitis, and dyspnea. AZELASTINE: OPHTHALMIC: MOST COMMON: Eye burning\/stinging, headaches, and bitter taste. OTHER EFFECTS: Asthma, conjunctivitis, dyspnea, eye pain, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, pruritus, rhinitis, and temporary blurring. BEPOTASTINE: OPHTHALMIC: Alterations in taste, eye irritation, nasopharyngitis, and headache.<br\/><\/li><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/>USES: Antiinflammatory agents used to treat a variety of clinical conditions, including adrenal insufficiency, asthma, various allergy disorders, and autoimmune disorders (eg, hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus). Corticosteroids are available in oral, parenteral, inhalational, and topical formulations. PHARMACOLOGY: Multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions. Anti-inflammatory effects result from decreased formation, release and activity of the mediators of inflammation (eg, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) which reduced the initial manifestations of the inflammatory process. The immunosuppressive properties decrease the response to delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, type III and type IV).  The antiproliferative effects reduce hyperplastic tissue characteristic of psoriasis. TOXICOLOGY: Corticosteroids decrease calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion, and inhibit osteoblast formation, leading to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute toxicity following overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Acute ingestion is rarely a clinical problem. Acute adrenal insufficiency rarely reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial fibrillation)(methylPREDNISolone), seizures (methylPREDNISolone), anaphylaxis. CHRONIC EXPOSURE:  Cushingoid appearance, muscle wasting and weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia, subcapsulary cataracts and glaucoma, osteoporosis, psychosis. ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL:  Dysphoria, irritability, emotional liability, depression, fatigue,  anxiety, depersonalization, myalgia, and arthralgia.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930204-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>AZELASTINE AND RELATED AGENTS  <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
