PHARMACOLOGY: During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from the nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum, which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase producing an increase synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDEs). The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE is the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Inadvertent ingestion in children occurs but rarely causes serious effects. PDE5s have the potential for abuse and misuse, and may be deliberately ingested with other drugs (eg amphetamines, hallucinogenic amphetamines, GHB, ketamine, amyl nirate) to enhance sexual experiences. TOXICOLOGY: Vardenafil has systemic vasodilatory effects that can produce transient decreases in blood pressure, flushing, or headache.  Based on the effects of PDE5 inhibition on the nitric oxide\/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, PDE5 inhibition may potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited data. Adverse events are anticipated to be similar to events observed with therapeutic use. During clinical trials in healthy volunteers, ingestion of a single 120-mg dose of vardenafil was associated with the development of reversible back pain, myalgias, and vision abnormalities. SEVERE TOXICITY: Information is limited. Hemodynamic compromise (eg, tachycardia, hypotension) may develop when combined with nitrates. In postmarketing experience, seizures and global amnesia have a temporal association with vardenafil. ABUSE\/MISUSE: There have been reports of misuse\/abuse with other PDE5 inhibitors and may occur with vardenafil. These agents have been used by younger individuals and combined with club drugs. ADVERSE EVENTS: Headache, flushing, and rhinitis may frequently occur with vardenafil therapy and appears to be dose-related. Other adverse effects that may occur include dizziness, dyspepsia, nausea, vision abnormalities, chest pain, and priapism. In postmarketing experience, seizures, seizure recurrence and transient global amnesia have developed in temporal association with vardenafil. <br\/>"},{"id":"927850-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VARDENAFIL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor vital signs. HYPOTENSION: Monitor blood pressure, administer isotonic fluids at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. CHEST PAIN: Nitrates are CONTRAINDICATED in patients with a recent vardenafil ingestion due to the possibility of a severe hypotensive reaction. Nitrates should be avoided for 24 hours (longer if on P450 inhibitors or if hepatic or renal dysfunction are present), given the risk of hypotension and exacerbation of ischemia. SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPOTENSION: Patients with persistent hypotension despite intravenous fluids require vasopressors, theoretically alpha agonists norepinephrine and phenylephrine may be more effective. PRIAPISM is an emergency requiring immediate consult with a urologist.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered in a recent, large ingestion and the patient is alert and able to protect the airway. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered in a recent, large ingestion or coingestants are suspected and the patient is alert and able to protect the airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support is unlikely to be necessary following a minor exposure; airway management may be necessary in patients that develop hemodynamic or cardiovascular instability<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Priapism: An immediate urological consult is necessary. Clinical history should include the use of other agents (ie, antihypertensives, antidepressants, illegal agents) that may also be contributing to priapism. In a patient with ischemic priapism the corpora cavernosa are often completely rigid and the patient complains of pain, while nonischemic priapism the corpora are typically tumescent, but not completely rigid and pain is not typical. Aspirate blood from the corpus cavernosum with a fine needle. Blood gas testing of the aspirated blood may be used to distinguish ischemic (typically PO2 less than 30 mmHg, PCO2 greater than 60 mmHg, and pH less than 7.25) and nonischemic priapism. Color duplex ultrasonography may also be useful. If priapism persists after aspiration, inject a sympathomimetic. PHENYLEPHRINE: Dose: Adult: For intracavernous injection, dilute phenylephrine with normal saline for a concentration of 100 to 500 mcg\/mL and give 1 mL injections every 3 to 5 minutes for approximately 1 hour (before deciding that treatment is not successful). For children and patients with cardiovascular disease: Use lower concentrations in smaller volumes. NOTE: Treatment is less likely to be effective if done more than 48 hours after the development of priapism. Distal shunting (NOT first-line therapy) should only be considered after a trial of intracavernous injection of sympathomimetics.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor patients for signs of hypotension, especially when organic nitrates have been concomitantly taken. Obtain a baseline ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Routine laboratory studies are not routinely necessary, unless otherwise indicated. Vardenafil plasma concentrations are not clinically useful. Males should be observed for signs of priapism.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of benefit due to the high protein binding and large volume of distribution of vardenafil.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A minor inadvertent dose (a single dose) in an asymptomatic child can likely be monitored at home with adult supervision. An inadvertent extra dose(s) (up to 20 mg) in an asymptomatic adult can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: A patient with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients with suspected or known coingestants (eg, nitrates, club drugs) should be monitored and evaluated. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent hemodynamic or cardiovascular instability should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for cases severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Consult a urologist in cases of priapism.
