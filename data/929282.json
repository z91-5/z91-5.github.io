The DNA coding for human antithrombin was introduced along with a mammary gland specific DNA sequence into the goats resulting in the expression of the antithrombin into the milk. Antithrombin reduces the risk of venous thromboembolism by complexing with thrombin and Factor Xa, thereby neutralizing their activity in the process of coagulation. When antithrombin is bound to heparin, the thrombin and Factor Xa inhibition is enhanced greater than 300 to 1000-fold.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"929282-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"929282-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: (IV, adults), 126.2 to 156.1 mL\/kg <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"929282-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"adults: (IV) 11.6 to 17.7 hr <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"929282-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>bring vial to room temperature no more than 3 hr prior to reconstitution<\/li><li>reconstitute with SWI immediately prior to use; do not shake<\/li><li>add solution to a syringe or dilute in NS to a final concentration of 100 international units\/mL<\/li><li>administer through an in-line 0.22 micron filter<\/li><li>use solution in syringe or diluted product within 8 to 12 hr of preparation when stored at room temperature<\/li><li>administer loading dose as a 15-min IV infusion followed immediately by continuous maintenance infusion<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"929282-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>target antithrombin activity level range of 80% to 120% of normal (0.8 to 1.2 international units\/mL)<\/li><li>antithrombin activity levels; initial, check level 2 hr after therapy initiation and once or twice daily<\/li><li>antithrombin activity levels; if level is less than 80% or greater than 120% of normal, adjust dose and recheck level in 2 hr; if level is 80% to 120% of normal, recheck in 6 hr<\/li><li>surgical patients: plasma antithrombin level 24 hr prior to and just after surgery<\/li><li>pregnant patients: plasma antithrombin level prior to and just after delivery<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"929282-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"Advise patient to report signs\/symptoms of bleeding or injection site reactions. <br\/>"}}}
