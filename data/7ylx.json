Other names for methamphetamine include speed or crank. \"Ice\" is smokable high purity methamphetamine hydrochloride. Although rare, methamphetamine can also be prescribed for the treatment of ADHD and obesity. PHARMACOLOGY: Methamphetamine increases catecholamine release resulting in stimulation of adrenergic receptors in the CNS and periphery. TOXICOLOGY:  Well absorbed by many routes (ingestion, smoking, nasal insufflation, parenterally); high lipophilicity allows it to readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Overstimulation of adrenergic receptors causes tachycardia, hypertension, agitation.  Increased norepinephrine causes alerting and anorectic effects and locomotor stimulation.  Increases in serotonin and dopamine alter perception, induce euphoria, and often cause psychotic behavior. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Methamphetamine is a common drug of abuse that displays unique features of acute and chronic toxicity. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In recreational doses or mild overdoses, patients may demonstrate sympathetic findings of diaphoresis, tachypnea, mydriasis, tremor, and nausea.  Potential cardiovascular effects include hypertension and tachycardia.  Neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms include euphoria, mild agitation, hyperreflexia, bruxism, and headache. SEVERE TOXICITY:  Life-threatening hyperthermia occurs as a direct result of increased muscular activity and neuromuscular excitation. In addition, acute intoxication can cause severe agitation, seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage, choreoathetoid movements, and paranoid psychosis.  Muscle rigidity and psychomotor agitation can also lead to rhabdomyolysis and renal failure.   Ventricular dysrhythmias, vasospasm, myocardial infarction, and aortic dissection are rare complications of severe overdose.  Acute ischemic events occur from severe vasospasm (ie, acute lung injury, ischemic colitis).  Death may result from hyperthermia in addition to other complications. CHRONIC TOXICITY: Poor dentition, skin lesions and excoriations from formication, cachexia, and generally poor self-care are common findings with chronic abuse (months to years).  Cardiovascular complications from long-term abuse include vasculitis, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and aortic and mitral valve regurgitation.  Infectious complications (HIV, viral hepatitis, endocarditis, abscess, osteomyelitis) may develop with parenteral abuse. BODY PACKERS\/BODY STUFFERS: Please refer to the appropriate management if body packing or body stuffing is known or suspected. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Abdominal pain, loss of appetite, xerostomia, headache, insomnia, tremor, euphoria, dysphoria, and agitation may occur with methamphetamine therapy.<br\/>"},{"id":"7ylxs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>METHAMPHETAMINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation.  Some may need benzodiazepines and intravenous fluids for symptomatic treatment. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and liberal use of benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment.  The goals of treatment are to control agitation and prevent or limit end organ toxicity. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of severe psychomotor agitation, repeated seizure activity, or coma.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is not recommended as the risk of aspiration (seizures) probably outweighs any potential benefit. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents promptly after an oral overdose and is not manifesting toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients that are manifesting signs of toxicity, as the risk of aspiration probably outweighs any potential benefit. If the airway is protected with orotracheal intubation, charcoal may be considered if the ingestion is recent.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe poisoning (coma, seizures, severe agitation).<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for methamphetamine.<\/li><li>Delirium: Liberal use of benzodiazepines is recommended for agitation\/delirium until patient is under control.<\/li><li>Tachycardia: Tachycardia may occur from a combination of agitation and catecholamine release.  Treat with benzodiazepines and intravenous fluids.  Beta blockers should generally be avoided in these patients, because of the risks of unopposed alpha stimulation.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare and often self-limited but may be a result of CNS stimulation.  Treatment includes intravenous benzodiazepines, propofol or barbiturates and paralysis with continuous EEG and neurology consult if necessary for status epilepticus.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Hypertension should be treated with benzodiazepines initially to control agitation.  Alpha adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as phentolamine, and vasodilators, such as nitroprusside and nitroglycerin, are second-line agents to be considered for severe hypertension with end organ compromise. Beta-blockers should generally be avoided in these patients, because of the risks of unopposed alpha stimulation.<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: Hyperthermia can result from psychomotor agitation and must be treated aggressively.  Monitor rectal temperature, and sedate the patient aggressively with benzodiazepines. Placing the patient in an ice water bath is the most effective technique of rapid cooling. More practical methods include keeping the skin moist and encouraging evaporation with fans (may be less effective in a humid environment) or packing the patient in ice from head to toe, anteriorly and posteriorly. Other cooling measures such as cool packs in the axilla and groin are often ineffective in lowering core temperature rapidly. Consider intubation and neuromuscular paralysis for severe hyperthermia.<\/li><li>Rhabdomyolysis: Administer sufficient 0.9% saline to maintain urine output of 2 to 3 mL\/kg\/hr.  Monitor input and output, serum electrolytes, CK, and renal function. Diuretics may be necessary to maintain urine output. Urinary alkalinization is NOT routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Methamphetamine plasma concentrations are not clinically useful or readily available.  Screening urine toxicology immunoassays may indicate exposure, however, there are many substances that cause a false positive result. No specific lab work is needed in most patients but may be helpful in ruling out other causes of altered mental status if the diagnosis of methamphetamine toxicity is uncertain. Laboratory or radiological studies should be performed if warranted by the patient's clinical presentation. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with moderate to severe toxicity. Obtain cardiac enzymes if patient has chest pain. Consider a head CT and lumbar puncture to rule out intracranial mass, bleeding, or infection. Consider CT angiogram if aortic pathology is suspected. CPK should be obtained if rhabdomyolysis is suspected in the patient who has severe psychomotor agitation, seizure activity, or hyperthermia.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value for methamphetamine.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  Children with any exposure, symptomatic adults or those with intentional overdose, should be evaluated in a health care facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients  should be observed for at least 4 hours, as peak plasma concentrations and thus symptoms will likely develop within this time period.  Symptomatic patients should be treated and observed until symptoms improve or resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous stimulation and\/or abnormal vital signs should be admitted.  Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, any other life threatening result of toxicity or intubated patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.
