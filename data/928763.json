PHARMACOLOGY: Lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor against epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) HER1 and HER2. HER1 and HER2 are overexpressed in over 20% of breast tumors, and is a key component in regulating tumor cell growth, proliferation, metastasis, and transformation. Lapatinib reversibly binds to the intracellular cytoplasmic site of tyrosine kinase at the ATP-binding site, inhibits receptor phosphorylation and activation of HER1 and HER2 homodimers and heterodimers, thereby blocking the downstream signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation, survival and invasion. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Lapatinib overdose information is limited. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects. Grade 3 diarrhea and vomiting occurred in one patient who received 3000 mg of lapatinib for 10 days. Cases of lapatinib overdose (doses 2500 to 9000; duration: 1 to 17 days) have been reported. Patients were either asymptomatic or developed symptoms that were similar to adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Some patients also developed sore scalp, sinus tachycardia, and\/or mucosal inflammation. Dose related QTc prolongation has been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse reactions following administration of lapatinib, in combination with capecitabine or letrozole, are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, and plantar erythrodysesthesia. OTHER EFFECTS: Stomatitis, dyspepsia, dry skin, pain in extremity, back pain, dyspnea, insomnia, nail disorder, epistaxis, hepatotoxicity,  hyperbilirubinemia, and hypersensitivity reaction, interstitial lung disease, and pneumonitis have also been reported. QT prolongation has been noted in patients receiving lapatinib. Predisposing factors include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, congenital long QT syndrome, concomitant anti-arrhythmic agents or other agents known to prolong the QT interval, and cumulative high-dose anthracycline therapy. QTc prolongation appeared to be related to lapatinib concentration. <br\/>"},{"id":"928763-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LAPATINIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Early management of diarrhea with antidiarrheal agents (ie, loperamide) should be considered. Correct serum electrolyte abnormalities and replace fluids as needed. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant serum electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Treat diarrhea with antidiarrheal agents; severe cases may require intravenous fluid replacement and the use of antibiotics (ie, fluoroquinolones) especially if symptoms persist or fever is present. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. QT prolongation has been noted in patients receiving lapatinib for advanced cancer. Concomitant use of lapatinib and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities, overdrive pacing may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, severe respiratory distress, or severe allergic reaction.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Eruption: Rash may resolve with continued therapy. Medications that may be effective include topical clindamycin 1% as monotherapy or with benzoyl peroxide 5% gel, oral tetracycline, or oral minocycline.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. In patients with a lapatinib overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and hepatic enzymes after significant overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count after significant overdose. Monitor ECG for evidence of QT interval prolongation; institute continuous cardiac monitoring.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to the high protein binding (greater than 99%) of lapatinib, hemodialysis is not expected to be an effective method of enhanced elimination.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of 1 or 2 extra dose(s) can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than 1 or 2 extra dose(s) should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe electrolyte imbalance, cardiac dysrhythmias, or respiratory distress should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928763-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>LAPATINIB<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
