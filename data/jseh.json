Inhibition of platelet aggregation occurs in a dose-dependent manner.  Abciximab binding to the GPIIb\/IIIa receptor prevents fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, and other adhesive molecules from binding to the receptor, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.

Orbofiban has been investigated as an oral glycoprotein llb\/IIIa receptor antagonist in unstable angina and myocardial infarction but has been associated with an increase in mortality. PHARMACOLOGY: Glycoprotein llb\/llla receptor antagonists prevent the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands to glycoprotein llb\/llla receptors, resulting in inhibition of platelet aggregation. Inhibition of platelet aggregation is reversible following discontinuation of glycoprotein llb\/llla receptor antagonist therapy, and is thought to be due to dissociation of the receptor antagonist from platelets. TOXICOLOGY: Inhibition of platelet aggregation can result in bleeding. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Clinically significant toxicity from overdose is rare since these drugs are used in an inpatient setting. Approximately, 5% of patients treated with therapeutic doses of glycoprotein llb\/llla inhibitors will develop major bleeding. OVERDOSE: In clinical trials, eptifibatide overdose occurred in 17 cases and no one experienced intracranial bleeding or significant bleeding. In case reports, prolonged infusions of glycoprotein llb\/llla receptor antagonists were associated with gastrointestinal bleeding and thrombocytopenia. Alveolar hemorrhage should be suspected in patients with hemoptysis, dyspnea or new infiltrates on chest x-ray. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Bleeding, particularly at the site of catheterization, and thrombocytopenia are the most common complications following therapeutic administration of glycoprotein llb\/llla receptor antagonists. The risk of bleeding is increased with concomitant administration of heparin or aspirin. Alveolar and intracranial hemorrhage are rare occurrences following therapy. Hypotension may occur during infusion of the glycoprotein llb\/llla receptor antagonists. <br\/>"},{"id":"jsehs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>GLYCOPROTEIN IIB-IIIA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: PARENTERAL EXPOSURE: Monitor CBC, including platelets, aPTT, and PT\/INR.
