In moderate to severe aplastic anemia, antithymocyte globulin equine is indicated in patients unsuitable for bone marrow transplant. Antithymocyte globulin rabbit is indicated as an adjunct with other immunosuppression therapy for the treatment of renal transplant rejection. PHARMACOLOGY: The exact mechanism of immunosuppression is not fully understood. Antithymocyte globulins reduce the quantity of circulating T-lymphocytes, which are involved in cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Possible mechanisms include clearance of T-lymphocytes from circulation and alteration of T-lymphocyte activation, homing, and cytotoxic activities. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common adverse reactions following administration of antithymocyte globulin equine or rabbit are fever, chills, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, GI disturbances (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), serum sickness due to the drug, and infection. Other effects include chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, rash, pruritus, thyroid disorder, abnormal renal function, anaphylaxis, headache, sensory neuropathy, dyspnea, and acute lung injury. <br\/>"},{"id":"jwl5s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LYMPHOCYTE IMMUNE GLOBULIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Myelosuppression has been reported. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory distress.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Supplemental oxygen; PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed.<\/li><li>Plasmapheresis: Plasmapheresis has been shown beneficial in the treatment of serum sickness secondary to antithymocyte globulin therapy.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, mental status, and renal function in symptomatic patients. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count. Monitor arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, and pulmonary function tests, and obtain a chest x-ray in any patient with respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe symptoms despite treatment should be admitted.
