PHARMACOLOGY: Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of aromatase and thus, in postmenopausal women, inhibits conversion of adrenal androgens (primarily androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) in peripheral tissues and cancer tissue. As a result, letrozole interferes with estrogen-induced stimulation or maintenance of growth of hormonally responsive (estrogen and\/or progesterone receptor positive or receptor unknown) breast cancers. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. In isolated cases of letrozole overdose, the highest single dose of 62.5 mg or 25 tablets did not result in serious adverse effects. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (more than 20%): Hot flashes, arthralgia, flushing, asthenia, edema, bone pain, headache, dizziness, hypercholesterolemia, and increased sweating. OTHER EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, chest pain, rash, alopecia, vaginal discharge, bleeding, and irritation, urinary tract infection, elevated liver enzymes, muscle pain, joint pain, back pain, limb pain, fatigue, insomnia, dyspnea, and cough. Pancytopenia, leukopenia, and peripheral thromboembolic events, such as venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, portal vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism have rarely been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing reports, however, cause and effect relationships have not been established. Letrozole is classified as pregnancy category X. <br\/>"},{"id":"924338-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LETROZOLE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives. Evidence of an acute thrombotic\/thromboembolic event (eg, sudden onset of swelling\/tenderness in a limb and\/or shortness of breath) requires prompt diagnostic evaluation (eg, ultrasound, CT scan) and anticoagulation as indicated.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and liver enzymes. Monitor CBC with differential after a substantial overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis is unlikely to be helpful since letrozole has a large volume of distribution (1.9 L\/kg).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
