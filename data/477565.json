precise mechanism of action unknown, but may involve synergy between praziquantel and the host's humoral immune response in S. mansoni;  praziquantel is rapidly taken up by helminths and also appears to increase permeability of helminth's cell membrane, leading to a loss of intracellular calcium; massive contraction and paralysis of the helminth's musculature rapidly result; after exposure to praziquantel, tegument in neck region of adult helminths develops blebs, which appear to burst and disintegrate; praziquantel also produces intense vacuolization at several sites in tegument of adult schistosomes; in S. mansoni, this is followed by phagocytic attachment to parasite and, ultimately, death.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"477565-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"477565-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Rapidly absorbed <br\/>"},"2":{"id":"477565-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic: First-pass<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"477565-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: small amounts;
