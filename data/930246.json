PHARMACOLOGY: These agents work by buffering hydrochloric acid in the stomach and increasing gastric pH. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicity can result from excessive bicarbonate absorption causing systemic alkalosis, or from excessive absorption of the cations in the alkaline salts (eg, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, sodium). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common; significant toxicity is rare and generally develops from chronic excessive use rather than acute overdose. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Diarrhea or constipation can develop. Asymptomatic hypermagnesemia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, elevations in serum aluminum concentrations or mild volume overload may also develop after chronic excessive use. SEVERE TOXICITY: With prolonged administration and\/or excessively large doses, dysrhythmias, hypo- and hypertension, encephalopathy, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal obstruction and\/or perforation, metabolic alkalosis, fluid, electrolyte, and mineral derangements, and myopathies and osteodystrophies have been reported. Distention and\/or obstruction with perforation and hypergastrinemia have been observed with prolonged or excessive antacid administration.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Evaluate for electrolyte abnormalities (hypernatremia, hypermagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia) and volume overload and treat as necessary. Monitor ECG.<\/li><li>Decontamination: GI decontamination is not necessary because of the poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and lack of systemic toxicity after acute overdose.<\/li><li>Hypercalcemia: Treat with intravenous hydration; add diuretics if hypercalcemia persists.<\/li><li>Hypermagnesemia: Treat with intravenous fluids. Monitor ECG and neurologic exam (particularly deep tendon reflexes). Hemodialysis can be used to treat severe hypermagnesemia.<\/li><li>Aluminum intoxication: Generally no treatment is required beyond cessation of exposure. Deferoxamine can be used for severe aluminum intoxication, primarily in patients with renal failure.<\/li><li>Hypernatremia: Treat with intravenous hydration.<\/li><li>Congestive heart failure: Treat with nitrates and diuretics.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis can be used to correct severe hypermagnesemia or hypercalcemia but is rarely necessary.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No routine laboratory studies are needed in patients with acute exposure. In patients with chronic excessive use, monitor vital signs and evaluate for clinical evidence of volume overload. Monitor fluids, serum electrolytes (including calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus), ECG, and renal function tests in symptomatic patients and those with chronic excessive use. Monitor serum aluminum concentrations in patients with encephalopathy after chronic use of aluminum containing antacids, particularly patients with renal failure.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with minimal GI symptoms after inadvertent exposure can be managed at home.
