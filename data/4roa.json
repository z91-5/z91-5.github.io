Overall, all forms of factor IX achieve hemostasis through the same mechanism.  A complex of factor VII and tissue factor (via the extrinsic coagulation pathway) and factor XIa (via the intrinsic pathway) activate factor IX which, in combination with factor VIII:C, activates factor X to Xa. Through this pathway, prothrombin is converted to thrombin which, in turn, converts fibrinogen to fibrin clot.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"4roas8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"4":{"id":"4roas8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>24 to 32 hours.<\/li><li>Factor VII: 3 to 6 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"4roas9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>warm to room temperature<\/li><li>use double-ended needle to transfer diluent (provided) to single-dose vial; direct flow of diluent against side of vial<\/li><li>let vial stand until contents are in solution and then swirl gently; do not shake; do not invert vial until ready to withdraw contents<\/li><li>use as soon as possible (within 3 hours) after reconstitution; discard unused portion<\/li><li>using microaggregate filter (provided), withdraw dose into syringe; discard filter<\/li><li>administer by slow infusion at a rate not exceeding: 2 mL\/min Bebulin(R) VH<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"4roas10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>normalization of coagulation parameters<\/li><li>factor IX assays at least once daily prior to infusion; in patients with severe hemorrhage or undergoing major surgery<\/li><li>early signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions; rate of administration may need to be adjusted and\/or therapy discontinued<\/li><li>symptoms of infection; human plasma-derived products carry a theoretical risk of infection including viruses and the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation; especially in patients with known liver disease, surgical patients, and patients with risk factors predisposing to thrombosis<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"4roas11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Bebulin<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 1 IU<br\/><\/li><li><b>Bebulin VH<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 1 IU<br\/><\/li><li><b>Profilnine<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 1 IU<br\/><\/li><li><b>Profilnine SD<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 1 IU<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"}}}
