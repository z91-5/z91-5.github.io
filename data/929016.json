PHARMACOLOGY: Naproxen is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), leading to decreased synthesis of prostanoids. Naproxen, like other NSAIDs, has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. TOXICOLOGY: Prostaglandin inhibition is responsible for the gastrointestinal irritant effects and nephrotoxicity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning with NSAIDs is not uncommon but rarely severe. Naproxen overdose is uncommon in the United States since other NSAIDs are used more often. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Gastrointestinal effects (eg, dyspepsia, ulceration, bleeding) are most commonly encountered. Renal dysfunction, most often in elderly patients, may occur. Mild CNS effects include altered cognition, drowsiness, headache, and mood changes, especially in the elderly population. SEVERE POISONING: Severe poisoning is rare but can include CNS depression, hallucinations, seizures, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and metabolic acidosis. ADVERSE EFFECTS: CNS effects include drowsiness, headache, fatigue, and cognition disturbances, especially in the elderly. Gastrointestinal effects (eg, dyspepsia, ulceration, bleeding) are as common as with other NSAIDs. Renal dysfunction, especially in the elderly population, may be seen. Instances of agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and pancreatitis have been reported. Hepatotoxicity is rare.<br\/><\/li><li><b>SUMATRIPTAN AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>USES: Sumatriptan and related medications are selective serotonin agonists indicated for the treatment of migraine headaches and cluster headaches. PHARMACOLOGY: Triptans activate vascular serotonin 5-HT1 receptors, producing vasoconstriction. This theoretically antagonizes the cerebral vasodilation that causes migraine headaches. TOXICOLOGY: In overdose, triptans lose their selectivity for the cerebral vasculature and causes excessive vasoconstriction via activation of vascular serotonin receptors. This excess vasoconstriction can result in hypertension, and could cause end-organ ischemia. Triptans can cause serotonin syndrome. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdoses of sumatriptan are relatively rare. Deaths have not been reported with poisoning, but severe cardiovascular effects have been associated with therapeutic doses. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Hypertension is common; patients are often asymptomatic. Triptans can cause serotonin syndrome in isolation or in conjunction with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or MAO inhibitors. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include altered mental status, hyperreflexia greater in the lower extremities, nystagmus, tremor, diaphoresis, and autonomic instability. SEVERE TOXICITY: While not described in the literature, overdose can theoretically cause vasoconstriction with severe hypertension, myocardial infarction, cardiac dysrhythmias, renal infarction, splenic infarction, ischemic colitis, and cerebral vascular accident (ischemic and hemorrhagic). Triptans can cause serotonin syndrome in isolation or in conjunction with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or MAO inhibitors. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include altered mental status, hyperreflexia greater in the lower extremities, nystagmus, tremor, diaphoresis, autonomic instability, rigidity and hyperthermia. ADVERSE EVENTS: Common adverse effects of sumatriptan include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, flushing and paresthesias. Chest pressure is reported in up to 15% of sumatriptan users but does not appear to be related to coronary vasospasm. Triptans have been reported to cause serotonin syndrome in isolation as well as when taken in conjunction with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or MAO inhibitors.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929016-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>NAPROXEN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Primarily supportive care; activated charcoal may not be necessary given the fast gastrointestinal absorption of the drug and anticipated mild toxicity. Give benzodiazepines titrated to effect for anxiety and seizures. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: If significant CNS depression occurs, consider orotracheal intubation for airway protection before giving charcoal. Give benzodiazepines for anxiety, agitation, delirium, and seizures. Be aware of the risk of renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of potential for somnolence and seizures. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if patients present early after a substantial ingestion. However, be aware of fast drug absorption and the potential for significant CNS toxicity early in the clinical course.<\/li><li>Airway management: Early orotracheal intubation in patients with signs of severe intoxication with CNS depression, seizures, or agitation.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status.

Hemodialysis is not useful given the high protein binding.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children and adults with inadvertent ingestions can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients and those with deliberate overdose should be sent to a health care facility for evaluation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with serious CNS depression, agitation or seizures, renal failure, significant metabolic acidosis, and severe gastrointestinal toxicity (ie, bleeding) require admission. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>SUMATRIPTAN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Care is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: HYPERTENSION: Treat severe hypertension (end organ effects) with sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin. Labetalol, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and phentolamine are alternatives. Triptan-associated myocardial ischemia has been successfully treated with aspirin, heparin and nitroglycerin. VENTRICULAR DYSRHYTHMIAS: Treat dysrhythmias per ACLS protocols. SEROTONIN SYNDROME: Treat with benzodiazepines. In severe cases (uncontrollable agitation and myoclonus, hyperthermia) neuromuscular paralysis, mechanical ventilation and sedation may be necessary. CYPROHEPTADINE is used to improve mild to moderate symptoms of serotonin syndrome. DOSE: ADULT: Initial dose of 12 mg, then 2 mg every 2 hours if the patient remains symptomatic. Maintenance: 8 mg every 6 hours. Maximum dose: 32 mg in 24 hours. CHILD 0.25 mg\/kg\/day divided every 6 hours, maximum 12 mg\/day.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be given to patients with a significant oral overdose in patients who are alert and can protect their airway. Activated charcoal is not indicated for those medications designed to be insufflated or dissolved on the tongue. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be given to patients with a significant oral overdose in patients who are alert and can protect their airway. Activated charcoal and gastric lavage are not indicated for those medications designed to be insufflated or dissolved on the tongue.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation should be considered for patients who present with significant CNS symptoms.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Sotalol may be an alternative for stable monomorphic VT. Amiodarone and sotalol should generally not be used if QT prolongation or torsades de pointes is present.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: These agents are selective serotonin agonists, which act at 5-HT(1) receptors and theoretically may produce serotonin syndrome. If symptoms are present, benzodiazepines are the mainstay of therapy. Cyproheptadine, a 5-HT antagonist, may also be used. Severe cases have been managed with benzodiazepine sedation and neuromuscular paralysis with nondepolarizing agents.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor for hypertension, ventricular dysrhythmias and clinical evidence of ischemia. Cardiac monitoring as indicated. Evaluate pulse oximetry and\/or ABGs in patients with chest pain or shortness of breath. Monitor symptomatic patients for acidosis\/electrolyte disorders (particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia).<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Sumatriptan has a large volume of distribution; therefore, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent exposure to therapeutic or near-therapeutic doses can be managed at home with observation. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients and patients with deliberate overdose should be referred to a health care facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop significant hypertension or signs\/symptoms or end-organ ischemia should be admitted for observation and treatment. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison center should be considered for any patient with significant symptoms or a significant overdose.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929016-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>NAPROXEN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Severe toxicity developed in an adolescent who ingested 13.75 g and in an adult who ingested 90 g of naproxen.
