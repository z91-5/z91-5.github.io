Other GLP-1 receptor agonists include the following agents: albiglutide, dulaglutide, and liraglutide. PHARMACOLOGY: GLP-1 receptor agonists activate the GLP-1 receptor, resulting in an increase in glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the beta-cells of the pancreas and a decrease in glucagon secretion. Gastric emptying is also delayed. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rarely reported. OVERDOSE: Exposure information is limited for these agents. In general, overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. EXENATIDE: Three patients with type 2 diabetes experienced severe nausea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia following subcutaneous administration of 100 mcg exenatide (10 times the maximum recommended dose). Another patient developed vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness with normal blood glucose after 90 mcg exenatide. LIRAGLUTIDE: Two adults developed severe nausea and vomiting following liraglutide subcutaneous injections of 17.4 mg (10 times the maximum recommended dose) and 72 mg; hypoglycemia did not develop. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Albiglutide (10% or greater incidence): nausea, diarrhea, injection site reaction, and upper respiratory tract infection. Dulaglutide (5% or greater incidence): nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite. Exenatide (5% or greater incidence): nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, feeling jittery, dizziness, headache, dyspepsia, and asthenia. Liraglutide (5% or greater incidence): nausea, diarrhea, and headache. LESS COMMON: Other adverse effects that may occur less frequently include hypersensitivity reactions (rash, pruritus, dyspnea), acute pancreatitis, and hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia may be increased with concomitant administration of a GLP-1 receptor agonist and insulin or an insulin secretagogue (eg sulfonylurea). Tachycardia and ECG abnormalities (increased PR intervals and first degree AV block) were infrequently reported with dulaglutide therapy.<br\/>"},{"id":"929571-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>EXENATIDE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. HYPOGLYCEMIA:  Hypoglycemic effects are enhanced in patients with concurrent administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues; obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. DIET: If the patient is awake and alert, offer carbohydrates. If hypoglycemia persists or becomes severe, treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia. NOT RECOMMENDED: Prophylactic dextrose administration is not recommended in patients who do not become hypoglycemic, as it may make it difficult to distinguish patients who become hypoglycemic and require prolonged hospitalization from those who remain asymptomatic and may be discharged sooner. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Hypoglycemic effects are enhanced in patients with concurrent administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues; obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. Treat hypoglycemia with IV dextrose boluses as needed. May need to repeat in patients with profound hypoglycemia. A dextrose infusion may be needed in patients in whom recurrent hypoglycemia develops, despite feeding and dextrose boluses. Titrate carefully to reduce the potential for reactive hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemic effects are enhanced in patients with concurrent administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues; obtain hourly blood glucose and monitor for clinical evidence of hypoglycemia for 8 to 12 hours. Monitor serum lipase in patients showing signs and symptoms consistent with pancreatitis. Monitor dermal injection sites for irritation or hypersensitivity reactions. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: All children with inadvertent injections should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Adults with a deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Diabetic adults with an inadvertent injection of an extra dose who are asymptomatic can be monitored at home. Asymptomatic nondiabetic adults with an inadvertent injection of an extra dose can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: There is no information on the onset or duration of hypoglycemia after overdose of these patients; however, due to the prolonged half-lives of these agents, patients may need to be monitored for a minimum of 8 to 12 hours if they are also taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop hypoglycemia should be admitted for a minimum of 24 hours for frequent blood glucose monitoring. They should only be discharged when free of symptoms and are able to maintain euglycemia without supplemental dextrose for 8 hours.
