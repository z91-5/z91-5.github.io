PHARMACOLOGY: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral agent that acts directly against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) via inhibition of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme essential for viral replication. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are anticipated to be similar to excessive pharmacologic adverse events. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (20% or greater): Sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin: Fatigue and headache. Sofosbuvir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin: Fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia, and anemia. COMMON (15% or greater): The following common adverse effects have also been reported in patients receiving sofosbuvir in combination with either ribavirin and\/or peginterferon alfa: Pruritus, rash, myalgia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, neutropenia, asthenia, irritability, fever, chills, and influenza-like illness. UNCOMMON BUT POTENTIALLY SERIOUS (less than 1%): Pancytopenia in patients receiving concomitant peginterferon alfa. Psychiatric disorders such as severe depression including suicidal ideation and suicide. <br\/>"},{"id":"930837-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SOFOSBUVIR<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea. Neutropenia may occur. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). In clinical trials, creatine kinase elevations of more than 10 times ULN occurred in 1% of patients treated for 12 weeks with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin and peginterferon alpha. Monitor creatine kinase levels. If severe elevations occur and there is a concern for rhabdomyolysis, treat the patient with aggressive IV fluids and consider sodium bicarbonate.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary unless more toxic agents are involved.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Administer colony stimulating factors in patients who develop severe neutropenia or neutropenic sepsis. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential daily until recovery has occurred. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation.<\/li><li>Rhabdomyolysis: During clinical trials, creatine kinase elevations of more than 10 times ULN occurred in 1% of patients treated for 12 weeks with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin and peginterferon alpha. Administer sufficient 0.9% saline to maintain urine output of 2 to 3 mL\/kg\/hr.  Monitor input and output, serum electrolytes, CK, and renal function. Diuretics may be necessary to maintain urine output. Urinary alkalinization is NOT routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs after significant overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant diarrhea. Monitor CBC with differential following significant overdose. Monitor liver enzymes for possible elevations in bilirubin following significant overdose. Monitor creatine kinase levels following significant overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding. Approximately 18% of the administered dose was removed during a 4-hour hemodialysis session.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who are symptomatic and patients with deliberate overdose should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe neutropenia should be admitted to the hospital. Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930837-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>SOFOSBUVIR<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
