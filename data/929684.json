may use at multiple bleeding sites in the same patient.<\/li><li>(Powder) Open pouch and take out vial.<\/li><li>(Powder) Check that powder is in bottom of vial; remove flip-off top but do not remove the stopper until ready to use; must be used within 1 hour after opening vial.<\/li><li>(Powder) Prepare sterile gelatin sponge; trim sponge to size for the bleeding area.<\/li><li>(Powder) Administer directly from vial or use the RaplixaSpray device; do not use more than 2 vials per 1 device.<\/li><li>(Powder, use directly from vial) Remove stopper, sprinkle a thin and uniform coating onto bleeding site, and apply pressure gently with gelatin sponge using sterile gauze; may also sprinkle onto a pre-wetted gelatin sponge and place onto bleeding site.<\/li><li>(Powder, use with RaplixaSpray device) Refer to the device labeling for usage instructions; then invert the device, place the upright vial into the gray rubber ring on the device, turn the device upright, and return the device to the sterile field until use.<\/li><li>(Powder, use with RaplixaSpray device) Activate air or gas flow; ensure that the pressure is 1.5 bar or 22 psi; device is now prepared for use, but do not push operating button until ready to start application of product.<\/li><li>(Powder, use with RaplixaSpray device) Keep vial within 45 degrees of vertical at all times; hold nozzle at least 5 cm or 2 inches from bleeding site and press the operating button to start application.<\/li><li>(Powder, use with RaplixaSpray device) Bleeding surface area should be covered with a uniform thin coating; apply within 10 to 60 seconds.<\/li><li>(Powder, use with RaplixaSpray device) Place gelatin sponge (dry or moistened with sterile saline) immediately on top of the powder; hold sponge in place with pressure using sterile gauze.<\/li><li>(Powder, use with RaplixaSpray device) Hold the device upside down before carefully removing the empty vial; a second vial may be attached, if needed.<\/li><li>(Powder, use with RaplixaSpray device) Use a new device to administer a third vial, if needed.<\/li><li>(Patch) Use topically on surface of cardiovascular tissue only.<\/li><li>(Patch) Resterilization is not possible, discard damaged packages.<\/li><li>(Patch) Outer foil patches may be opened in a nonsterile environment within the operating room, but the inner sterile blister must be opened in a sterile environment.<\/li><li>(Patch) Select the appropriate patch size to extend 1 to 2 cm beyond margin of wound; patches can be cut to the correct size and shape.<\/li><li>(Patch) If more than 1 patch is required, overlap patches by at least 1 cm.<\/li><li>(Patch) Irrigate the wound area as needed to remove alcohol, iodine, or heavy metal ions, which can denature the fibrinogen and thrombin proteins of the patch.<\/li><li>(Patch) The patch may be used wet or dry; for wet use, premoisten the patch in NS for no more than 1 minute and then apply immediately.<\/li><li>(Patch) If the tissue surface is wet (eg, oozing, bleeding), the patch may be applied without premoistening.<\/li><li>(Patch) The white inactive side of the patch may adhere to surgical instruments or gloves covered with blood; premoisten instruments and gloves with saline solution to reduce adherence.<\/li><li>(Patch) Apply the yellow active side directly to the bleeding area and hold in place using gentle pressure applied through moistened gloves or a moist pad; hold for at least 3 minutes.<\/li><li>(Patch) Prior to relieving pressure on the patch, place a premoistened surgical instrument at one end of the patch to hold it in place while carefully removing gloved hands or moistened pads from the patch.<\/li><li>(Patch) Gentle irrigation may be used to aid in removing gloved hands or premoistened pads from the patch.<\/li><li>(Patch) Do not move the patch once it has adhered to the organ tissue. Unattached patches (or parts of patches) should be removed and replaced with new patches.<\/li><li>(Patch) Record the batch number of the patch along with the patient's name.<\/li><li>(Patch) The application procedure may be repeated if bleeding continues during or after the compression period, but do not remove applied patches.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"929684-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>Control of bleeding may be indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>Blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, and end tidal carbon dioxide for signs and symptoms of embolism<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"929684-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Tachosil<\/b><br\/>Topical Sheet: (Fibrinogen - Thrombin, Human) 5.5 MG\/CM2-2 U\/CM2<br\/>"}}}
