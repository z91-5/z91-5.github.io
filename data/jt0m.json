EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are common, but toxicity is generally mild. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents inhibit angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE), thus preventing conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone secretion (aldosterone suppression reduces sodium and water retention). ACE inhibitors also prevent the breakdown of bradykinin (a potent vasodilator). The net result is vasodilatation, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, decreased blood pressure, increased cardiac output, and a relative increase in renal, cerebral, and coronary blood flow. TOXICOLOGY: The toxic effect of an ACE inhibitor is an extension of its pharmacologic effect. The elevation in bradykinin concentration appears to be the primary cause of both ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and cough. ACE inhibitors may also inhibit the metabolism of enkephalins and potentiate their opioid effect, which includes lowering blood pressure. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild hypotension. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, bradycardia, and renal failure. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Dry cough, hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency in patients with renal artery stenosis, maculopapular rash, angioneurotic edema, neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity.<br\/><\/li><li><b>VERAPAMIL<\/b><br\/>USES: Verapamil is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension, angina and in arrhythmias to control ventricular rate. PHARMACOLOGY: Calcium channel blockers are divided into 2 major classes, dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines. Verapamil, a phenylalkylamine, is a lipophilic, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It has selectivity for both vascular and myocardium calcium channels that can produce hypotension, bradycardia and conduction disturbances. Binds to and antagonizes L-type calcium channels located on all types of muscle cells resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and arterial vasodilation as well as decreased force of cardiac contraction and decreased heart rate and conduction. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive doses cause depression of the SA node (bradycardia) and suppression of conduction through the AV node (heart blocks) as well as decreased contractility. Vasodilatory effects of verapamil overdose are intermediate between those caused by dihydropyridines (eg nifedipine) and benzothiapines (eg diltiazem). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Common overdose, which may result in significant morbidity and mortality. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may have asymptomatic bradycardia or mild hypotension which may manifest as dizziness, fatigue, and\/or lightheadedness and can cardiac conduction defects (first-degree AV block). SEVERE TOXICITY: Can cause profound bradycardia and dysrhythmias (including complete heart block and asystole), pulmonary edema and hypotension resulting in cardiogenic shock and end-organ dysfunction including lethargy, syncope, altered mental status, seizures, cerebral ischemia, bowel ischemia, hyperkalemia, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coma, and death.  Hyperglycemia  generally develops in patients with severe poisoning. Rhabdomyolysis may occur in conjunction with acute renal failure follow prolonged hypotension.  ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Minor gastrointestinal effects, headache, infection, flu-like syndrome and rash have been reported. OTHER EFFECTS: Dizziness, hypotension, bradycardia, congestive heart failure\/pulmonary edema, fatigue and flushing have developed. Cardiac conduction defects (ie, AV blocks, complete heart block) have also occurred with therapy. RARE: Myoclonus and gynecomastia are unusual effects that have been reported.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jt0ms12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ACE INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients will have no symptoms, but patients with mild orthostatic hypotension can be treated by remaining prone. Those who remain hypotensive can be treated with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if the patient presents with circulatory collapse. Correct severe hyperkalemia using standard treatments such as glucose, insulin, calcium, sodium bicarbonate, sodium polystyrene sulfate and hemodialysis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: As severe toxicity is very rare, prehospital decontamination is generally not recommended. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient presents early after large ingestion, with appropriate level of consciousness, patent airway, and can drink the charcoal. Gastric lavage is generally not necessary as life threatening toxicity is rare.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who have severe angioedema may require fiber optic or surgical airway procedures.<\/li><li>Antidote: Angiotensin infusion at doses ranging from 8.5 to 18 mcg\/minute has been successful in reversing hypotension in patients who did not respond to volume and pressor infusions, but is not available in the United States.<\/li><li>Naloxone: Although the role of naloxone in the setting of ACE inhibitor overdose remains unclear, it may be considered especially in cases of severe hypotension where fluid overload is a concern. The dose of naloxone should be administered in titrated doses starting with 0.2 to 2 mg IV repeated every 2 to 3 minutes to improve blood pressure; maximum dose 8 mg. Pediatrics: 0.01 to 0.1 mg\/kg, repeated every 2 to 3 minutes as needed.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor blood pressure, continuous cardiac monitoring, electrolytes, renal function, ECG and urinalysis in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: ACE inhibitors are dialyzable, but hemodialysis is not used because supportive care is usually effective.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  Pediatric patients can be observed at home if they have ingested less than 2 times the defined daily dose (DDD) of an ACE inhibitor and they remain asymptomatic. The DDD of specific ACE inhibitors are as follows: Captopril: 50 mg; Enalapril: 10 mg; Fosinopril: 15 mg; Lisinopril: 10 mg; Perindopril: 4 mg; Ramipril: 2.5 mg; Trandolapril: 2 mg. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions, and children who are symptomatic, or who have ingested at least 2 times the defined daily dose (DDD) of an ACE inhibitor should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation and evaluation. The DDD of specific ACE inhibitors are as follows: Captopril: 50 mg; Enalapril: 10 mg; Fosinopril: 15 mg; Lisinopril: 10 mg; Perindopril: 4 mg; Ramipril: 2.5 mg; Trandolapril: 2 mg. Patients who are asymptomatic 6 hours after ingestion can be discharged (after psychiatric evaluation as appropriate). ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic or hypotensive patients should be admitted to a monitored bed. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity, or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>VERAPAMIL<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients who have asymptomatic bradycardia can be admitted and observed with telemetry. Obtain peripheral intravenous access and an ECG. Mild hypotension may only require treatment with intravenous fluid administration. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with bradycardia and hypotension require standard ACLS treatment. Place a central line and consider placement of an arterial line. Standard first line treatment includes atropine for bradycardia although in a serious poisoning it is rarely effective. High dose insulin and dextrose have been effective in animal studies and multiple case reports in patients with hypotension refractory to other modalities, and should be considered early in patients with significant hypotension. Use intravenous calcium in severe poisonings although in these cases, beneficial effects of calcium infusion (calcium chloride is preferred) may be very minimal or short-lived. Repeat bolus doses or a continuous intravenous infusion are often needed. Standard vasopressors should be administered to maintain blood pressure. Lipid emulsion has been successful in animal studies and several case reports of patients with hypotension refractory to other therapies. Intravenous glucagon has been used with variable success. In a patient whose hemodynamic status continues to be refractory despite the treatment described above, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or cardiopulmonary bypass should be considered. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of the potential for abrupt deterioration. HOSPITAL: Because a verapamil overdose can be life-threatening, all significant ingestions should receive activated charcoal. Patients with altered mental status should be intubated prior to administration. Gastric lavage should be considered in patients with recent large ingestions if the airway is protected. Late gastric lavage may be effective following sustained-release products. Whole bowel irrigation should be considered early for patients who can protect their airway or who are intubated who have ingested sustained-release formulations; it can limit absorption from possible concretions. Whole bowel irrigation should NOT be performed in patients who are hemodynamically unstable.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate patients with coma, mental status depression or significant hemodynamic instability.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Treat initially with fluids (insert a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter to guide fluid therapy if hypotension persists). Consider inserting an arterial line in patients with refractory hypotension. Intravenous calcium, vasopressors, high dose insulin\/dextrose, intravenous lipid emulsion, and glucagon may all be useful for refractory hypotension. Pacemakers (external or internal), intraaortic balloon pump, and cardiopulmonary bypass have been used in patients refractory to other modalities.<\/li><li>Calcium: Intravenous calcium infusions have been shown to be helpful, although response is often short lived. Optimal dosing is not established; start with an initial IV infusion of about 13 to 25 mEq of calcium (10 to 20 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 30 to 60 mL of 10% calcium gluconate) followed by either repeat boluses every 15 to 20 minutes up to 3 to 4 doses or a continuous infusion starting with 0.5 mEq\/kg\/hr of calcium (0.2 to 0.4 mL\/kg\/hr of 10% calcium chloride or 0.6 to 1.2 mL of 10% calcium gluconate) and titrate as needed. Calcium dosing should be titrated to hemodynamic response rather than serum calcium concentration alone; central venous or pulmonary artery catheters may be useful to guide therapy. Monitor ECG and ionized calcium concentration. Patients with severe overdose have tolerated significant hypercalcemia (up to twice the upper limit of normal) without developing clinical or ECG evidence of hypercalcemia.<\/li><li>Insulin: Administer a bolus of 1 unit\/kg of insulin followed by an infusion of 0.1 to 1 unit\/kg\/hr, titrated to a systolic blood pressure of greater than 90 to 100 mmHg (bradycardia may or may not respond). Reassess every 30 minutes to titrate insulin infusion. Administer dextrose bolus to patients with an initial blood glucose of less than 250 mg\/dL (adults 25 to 50 mL dextrose 50%, children 0.25 g\/kg dextrose 25%). Begin a dextrose infusion of 0.5 g\/kg\/hr in all patients. Monitor blood glucose every 15 to 30 minutes until consistently 100 to 200 mg\/dL for 4 hours, then monitor every hour. Titrate dextrose infusion to maintain blood glucose in the range of 100 to 200 mg\/dL. As the patient improves, insulin resistance abates and dextrose requirements will increase. Supplemental dextrose will be needed for at least several hours after the insulin infusion is discontinued. Administer supplemental potassium initially if patient is hypokalemic (serum potassium less than 2.5 mEq\/L). Monitor serum potassium every 4 hours and supplement as needed to maintain potassium of 2.5 to 2.8 mEq\/L.<\/li><li>Vasopressor: Anecdotal reports suggest that epinephrine, vasopressin, metaraminol, or phenylephrine may occasionally be effective in patients who do not respond to dopamine or norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Fat Emulsion: Lipid emulsion has been successful in animal studies and several case reports of patients with hypotension refractory to other therapies. Administer 1.5 mL\/kg of 20% lipid emulsion over 2 to 3 minutes as an IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min. If possible, discontinue after 30 to 60 minutes. Longer periods of lipid therapy should be considered if the patient's hemodynamic stability is dependent on continued lipid infusion.<\/li><li>Glucagon: DOSE: ADULT: Optimal dosing in calcium antagonist poisoning is not established. Initially, 3 to 5 mg IV, slowly over 1 to 2 minutes; may repeat treatment with a dose of 4 to 10 mg if there is no hemodynamic improvement within 5 minutes. CHILD: 50 mcg\/kg; repeat doses may be used due to the short half-life of glucagon.<\/li><li>L-Carnitine: L-carnitine may be useful to treat hypotension in the setting of calcium channel blocker overdose. It is not well studied but an animal study and one human case report suggest efficacy. The dose used in the human case report was 6 g IV followed by 1 g IV every 4 hours.<\/li><li>Phosphodiesterase inhibitor: There are case reports where a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (inamrinone, enoximone) appeared to improve blood pressure in patients unresponsive to other modalities.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum verapamil concentrations are not readily available and not helpful to guide therapy. Monitor vital signs frequently. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs. Monitor serum electrolytes, blood glucose, and renal function. In patients with significant hypotension or bradycardia, monitor arterial or venous blood gas, and urine output. Obtain digoxin concentration in patients who also have access to digoxin. Monitor cardiac enzymes in patients with chest pain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is likely not of value following a verapamil exposure, because of the high degree of protein binding (90%).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: According to the AAPCC guidelines, a healthy, asymptomatic adult with a single inadvertent ingestion of verapamil 120 mg or less of immediate-release or a chewed sustained release tablet, or 480 mg or less of a sustained release formulation can be monitored at home. For children, ingestions of less than 2.5 mg\/kg can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with underlying cardiovascular disease, those taking beta blockers or another cardiodepressant drug, and those with deliberate ingestions should be referred to a health care facility for treatment, evaluation and monitoring. According to the AAPCC guidelines, a patient with an inadvertent single ingestion of verapamil greater than 120 mg immediate release or a chewed sustained-release, or greater than 480 mg sustained release formulation should be referred to a healthcare facility. For children, ingestion of greater than 2.5 mg\/kg should be referred to a healthcare facility. Patients should be observed for at least 6 hours after ingestion of immediate release and 18 to 24 hours after ingestion of a sustained release formulation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop signs or symptoms of toxicity should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist in cases of severe poisonings or in cases where there is a history of a large exposure.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jt0ms12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>ACE INHIBITORS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULT: Patients have ingested the following with only mild hypotension reported: 7.5 g captopril, 300 mg enalapril, and 420 mg lisinopril. Moderate hypotension (median BP 75\/36) was observed in 10 adults after ingesting a median ramipril dose of 210 mg (range: 100 to 280); 4 had coingested other cardiovascular agents and 2 coingested alcohol; all cases recovered. Fatalities have occurred after ingestions of 1125 mg captopril and 180 mg perindopril. CHILDREN: In one study, children remained asymptomatic after ingestions of up to 100 mg captopril or 30 mg enalapril. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Varies with agent. CAPTOPRIL: ADULT: 37.5 to 150 mg\/day in 3 divided doses. PEDIATRIC: 0.5 to 4 mg\/kg\/day divided. ENALAPRIL: ADULT: 2.5 to 20 mg\/day. PEDIATRIC: Initial: 0.08 mg\/kg\/day  (up to 5 mg). Adjust to blood pressure response LISINOPRIL: ADULT: 5 to 40 mg\/day orally. PEDIATRIC: 0.07 mg\/kg\/day; maximum 5 mg. PERINDOPRIL: ADULT: 4 to 16 mg in 1 or 2 divided doses; maximum 16 mg\/day. RAMIPRIL: ADULT: 2.5 to 20 mg once daily; maximum: 20 mg daily.<br\/><\/li><li><b>VERAPAMIL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose is variable depending on the particular formulation of verapamil. The following doses are considered to be potentially toxic: ADULT DOSE: Greater than 120 mg immediate release or chewed sustained release or greater than 480 mg sustained release formulation. PEDIATRIC DOSE: Greater than 2.5 mg\/kg. Single ingestions of therapeutic adult doses in children have resulted in death.  Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and the elderly tend to be more susceptible to the cardiac effects.  In general, ingestions of phenylalkylamines (eg, verapamil) are more serious than ingestions of other calcium antagonists (ie, dihydropyridines (nifedipine)). THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Titrate to desired effect based on indication (range, 240 mg to 480 mg daily), dose should not exceed 480 mg\/day. SUSTAINED RELEASE: Initial therapy: 180 mg daily. EXTENDED RELEASE: Typical dose is 200 mg daily at bedtime; maximum 400 mg daily. PEDIATRIC: Varies by indication.
