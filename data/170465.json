PHARMACOLOGY: Synthetic vasopressin analog; has antidiuretic activity and increases plasma factor VIII activity. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive antidiuretic activity or ingestion of free water causes hyponatremia. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, headache, hyponatremia. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hyponatremia, coma and seizures have developed in children and adolescents using desmopressin nasal spray unsupervised, presumed to be inadvertent overdoses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Potentially severe adverse effects reported with therapeutic use have included: hyponatremia and water intoxication in children and infrequently in adults. Nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, headache, behavior changes, seizures and coma have been associated with hyponatremia.

Rapid correction may cause central pontine myelinolysis.
