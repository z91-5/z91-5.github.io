WITHDRAWN FROM MARKET: Because of ongoing concerns over the safety of TACRINE it was withdrawn from the market in 2013. Other agents, such as metrifonate and velnacrine are also no longer used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PHARMACOLOGY: The precise mechanism of action of rivastigmine is unknown. However, it is thought to exert is effect by enhancing cholinergic function, by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure has occurred. Severe clinical events or fatalities are uncommon. OVERDOSE: Overdose information is limited. Cholinergic toxicity has been reported after overdose of rivastigmine, typical findings can include severe nausea, vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, collapse and convulsions. In severe cases, muscle weakness can develop and may result in death if respiratory muscles become involved. Other symptoms that have been associated with overdose of rivastigmine include: diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, confusional state, hyperhidrosis, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. Depression of blood cholinesterase may occur following overdoses.  ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common adverse effects reported with rivastigmine therapy include: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia. Other clinical events include dizziness, headache, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, and confusion. Infrequent events may include depression, anxiety, hallucination, and aggressive reactions. CHOLINERGIC ACTIVITY: Other events that can develop due to increases in cholinergic activity include extrapyramidal symptoms, worsening of parkinsonian symptoms (ie, tremor), seizures, increases in gastric acid secretion, at risk to develop ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding, bradycardia, and possible urinary obstruction. Drugs like rivastigmine the increase cholinergic activity should also be given with caution in patients with an underlying history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. POSTMARKETING EXPERIENCE: Based on postmarketing experience with rivastigmine, hepatitis, aggression, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and disseminated allergic dermatitis have been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"jtw7s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RIVASTIGMINE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor fluid status and electrolyte balance if the patient develops significant fluid loss (ie, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis). Treat nausea and vomiting with antiemetics and fluid replacement. Initially treat hypotension with IV fluids. Infuse 10 to 20 mL\/kg of isotonic fluid. If hypotension persists, administer dopamine or norepinephrine. Atropine is the drug of choice to treat cholinergic effects such as bradycardia, bronchorrhea and bronchospasm. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizure activity with IV benzodiazepines (diazepam or lorazepam). Consider phenobarbital or propofol if seizures recur. ANTIDOTES: Administer atropine for muscarinic manifestations (e.g. salivation, diarrhea, bronchorrhea); and pralidoxime for nicotinic manifestations (e.g. weakness, fasciculations) for severe toxicity. Assess respiratory function, airway management including intubation and mechanical ventilation as needed. Respiratory depression including muscle weakness can occur. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved. Acute lung injury may develop with a significant exposure. Maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation; serial ABGs and\/or pulse oximetry as necessary; PEEP may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is unlikely to be necessary as spontaneous vomiting is likely to occur. PREHOSPITAL: Spontaneous vomiting can occur after a significant exposure. Excessive vomiting may increase the risk of esophageal rupture and induced emesis is probably not indicated. HOSPITAL: GI decontamination is unlikely to be necessary as spontaneous vomiting it likely to occur. Activated charcoal may be considered if coingestants are suspected, the ingestion is recent, and the airway can be protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: A significant exposure can result in cholinergic crisis include respiratory depression and severe respiratory muscle weakness. Monitor respiratory effort and ventilation. Administer oxygen. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Antidote: Atropine sulfate is the drug of choice to treat cholinergic effects such as bradycardia, bronchorrhea and bronchospasm.  For significant muscarinic symptoms administer: ADULT: Initial dose of 1 to 2 mg IV repeat with subsequent doses based on clinical response; CHILD: Initial dose 0.05 mg\/kg up to 4 mg (usual dose 1 mg), intramuscularly or intravenously every 10 to 30 minutes until muscarinic signs and symptoms subside, and repeat if they reappear. ALTERNATIVE THERAPY: Glycopyrrolate and methscopolamine bromide have been suggested as alternatives to atropine in treating the peripheral cholinergic symptoms. PRALIDOXIME: Treat moderate to severe poisoning (fasciculations, muscle weakness, respiratory depression, coma, seizures) with pralidoxime in addition to atropine.<\/li><li>Bronchospasm: ALBUTEROL: ADULT: 0.25 to 0.5 mL in 2 to 4.5 mL of normal saline delivered every 4 to 6 hours per nebulizer; CHILD: 100 to 200 mcg 3 to 6 times a day.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor respiratory and cardiovascular function. Monitor pulse rate and blood pressure; alterations may develop as a result of cholinergic toxicity. Monitor fluid status in patients with significant cholinergic symptoms.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to the short half-life (1.5 hours) of rivastigmine, dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration) is not clinically indicated. Rivastigmine also has a large volume of distribution (range, 1.8 to 2.7 L\/kg); therefore, hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: All children with ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Adults with a deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Asymptomatic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of one or two pills can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be observed until all symptoms resolve. Patients that develop significant toxicity including respiratory depression should be admitted for a higher level of care. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop cholinergic crisis including respiratory depression should be admitted. They should only be discharged when free of symptoms. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or a poison center for assistance with medical management in patients with severe overdose or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Consult a pulmonologist or hospital intensivist if the patient develops evidence of respiratory compromise.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jtw7s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>RIVASTIGMINE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXIC DOSE: A toxic dose has not been established.
