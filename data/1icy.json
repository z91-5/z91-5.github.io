Colfosceril palmitate, palmitic acid, and tripalmitin are added to standardize the composition of beractant and make it similar to natural lung surfactant by optimizing surface tension-lowering properties.   When beractant is used as a replacement for deficient endogenous lung surfactant, it is effective in lowering surface tension on alveolar surfaces during respiration and stabilizing the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures. Therefore, beractant reduces the incidence of RDS, mortality due to RDS, and air-leak complications. <\/li><li>Neonatal RDS develops primarily in premature infants because of pulmonary immaturity, including a deficiency of endogenous lung surfactant that results in higher alveolar surface tension and lower compliance properties. Without sufficient endogenous lung surfactant, progressive alveolar collapse occurs and both oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange are impaired. Also, RDS appears to be characterized by high pulmonary vascular permeability and increased lung tissue water. Fluid and protein that leak into alveoli inactivate both endogenous and exogenous surfactant, worsening lung function. <\/li><li>Natural lung surfactant is a mixture of lipids and apoproteins secreted by the alveolar cells into the alveoli and respiratory air passages. Surfactant reduces the surface tension of pulmonary fluids and thereby increases lung compliance. It exhibits not only surface tension-reducing properties (contributed by the lipids) but also rapid spreading and adsorption (contributed by the apoproteins). The major fraction of the lipid component of natural lung surfactant is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC, colfosceril palmitate); this comprises up to 70% of the natural surfactant by weight. <\/li><\/ul>"},"9":{"id":"1icys9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>for intratracheal administration only<br\/><\/li><li><b>Intratracheal<\/b><br\/><ul><li>after removing unopened vial from the refrigerator, warm at room temperature for 20 minutes or warm in hand for at least 8 minutes, do not warm by artificial warming methods<\/li><li>do not shake vial, swirl gently to redisperse<\/li><li>after warming vial, unopened vials can be returned to refrigerator within 24 hours of warming to store only once, record date and time when vial is removed from the refrigerator<\/li><li>vials may not be out of refrigerator for more than 24 hours<\/li><li>does not require reconstitution or sonication before use<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"1icys10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>prevention or improvement of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants is evidence of efficacy<\/li><li>arterial or transcutaneous systemic oxygen and carbon dioxide levels; frequently during treatment<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"1icys11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Survanta<\/b><br\/>Intratracheal Suspension: 25 MG\/ML<br\/>"}}}
