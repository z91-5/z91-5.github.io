There are numerous proprietary products containing bulk-forming laxatives which include methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, psyllium, flaxseed, karaya, guar gum, malt soup extract, polycarbophil, tragacanth, and bran. PHARMACOLOGY:  The bulk-forming laxatives generally swell in water to form a gel that serves to maintain soft, well-hydrated feces.  They also reflexively stimulate peristalsis. TOXICOLOGY: The seed husk of psyllium mucilloid contains a protein that appears to be the source of the allergic reactions.  Highly purified psyllium mucilloid may decrease the allergenicity to psyllium-containing products. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common, but severe toxicity following acute overdosage with bulk forming laxatives is unlikely. Laxative abuse is seen with eating disorders (eg, anorexia nervosa, bulimia) as well as with factitious disorders (eg, Munchausen syndrome). MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may be noted with large doses.  Occupational asthma, dermatitis, urticaria have been reported in workers exposed to psyllium dust. Rhinitis and sneezing have been reported after occupational exposure to powdered dusts of guar gum and psyllium. SEVERE TOXICITY: Aspiration pneumonitis has been reported following exposure to guar gum products. Gastrointestinal obstruction may occur with very large doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Systemic toxicity is unlikely since these agents are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted in the feces. Severe toxicity following acute overdosage with bulk forming laxatives is unlikely. The greatest potential hazard is the risk of esophageal obstruction, usually seen in elderly patients, those with underlying gastrointestinal motility diseases, or in those taking products with insufficient fluids.  Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported following exposure to psyllium-containing products. <br\/>"},{"id":"493100-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LAXATIVES-BULK FORMING <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea. Encourage oral fluid intake. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose. Assess bowel function in all patients following an overdose; monitor for abdominal pain or distention, vomiting, or evidence of bowel obstruction. Encourage oral fluid intake if possible.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Laxatives-bulk forming agents undergo minimal absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients should be sent to a health care facility for evaluation and treatment as necessary. Patients with symptoms of esophageal obstruction should be referred to a health care facility.  Potential symptoms include sudden onset of dysphagia, retrosternal pain, vomiting, and hypersalivation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear. Consult a gastroenterologist and a specialist in eating disorders if chronic laxative abuse is suspected.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"493100-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>LAXATIVES-BULK FORMING <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: No toxic dose has been determined.
