is used for the treatment of pain. It is also abused for euphoric effects.  It is available as an extended release preparation, and as a combination tramadol and acetaminophen preparation. PHARMACOLOGY: Tramadol binds to mu opioid receptors and weakly inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. It is taken orally for pain control. TOXICOLOGY: Abusers may inject, snort or smoke as these routes achieve high serum levels rapidly, producing euphoria quickly. This puts them especially at risk for severe toxicity. Toxicity is an extension of the therapeutic effects. Tramadol causes sedation and respiratory depression. However, respiratory depression is generally less than with other opioids. Aspiration due to loss of gag reflex or apnea leading to hypoxia may cause death. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesia and euphoria effects, but not to respiratory depression. Monoaminergic effects, from inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, such as serotonin syndrome and seizures, may be present. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Tramadol is commonly used and often abused. Toxicity is common in chronic abusers. Physical and psychological dependence is possible. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and possibly pinpoint pupils may be seen. A small percentage of people feel anxious and agitated at therapeutic doses. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present.  SEVERE TOXICITY: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, possibly hypotension or bradycardia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Patients may be hypotensive. Rarely, seizures may develop. Death may result from any of these complications. Serotonin syndrome, a triad of altered mental status, neuromuscular excitability, and autonomic dysfunction, has been reported in overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dizziness, nausea, constipation, headache and somnolence. Respiratory depression and the effects on smooth muscles are usually less pronounced with tramadol compared to narcotics. Respiratory depression can result from coadministration of tramadol with alcohol, anesthetics, or other respiratory depressants. Physical and psychological dependence is a risk, although tramadol is less abused as a single drug than conventional narcotics. Withdrawal signs\/symptoms have been reported.<br\/>"},{"id":"923288-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>TRAMADOL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients generally only need observation and supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Naloxone is the antidote indicated for significant CNS or respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone Treat seizures with benzodiazepines.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination should generally be avoided due to the risk of CNS depression and seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be considered in asymptomatic patients who are likely to have medication remaining in their GI tract, or in symptomatic patients who have a secure airway. Consider gastric lavage after a very large (2.5 g or more) recent, ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (ie, coma, respiratory depression not reversed by naloxone).<\/li><li>Antidote: Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is a specific antidote. There is controversy regarding the use of naloxone for tramadol toxicity as it may theoretically unmask excitatory effects and precipitate seizures.  Naloxone can be given intravascular, intramuscular, intranasal or nebulized. The dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV.  Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg.  Larger doses of naloxone may be needed for reversal of tramadol compared with other opioid medications.  The duration of effect of naloxone is 1 to 2 hours.  The patient should be observed at least 3 to 4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. IV infusion may be necessary in patients that have ingested an extended-release preparation.  The infusion can be started at an hourly rate equal to the half the total amount required to reverse the symptoms.  Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients.  Opioid withdrawal is not life-threatening, but is extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Initially treat with a normal saline bolus, if the patient can tolerate the fluid volume. If necessary, use adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia or due to the properties of the drug. Treatment includes intravenous benzodiazepines, propofol or barbiturates may be used if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Delirium: Liberal use of benzodiazepines until patient is mildly sedated.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Treat aggressively with benzodiazepines, while cooling the patient, if needed. Cyproheptadine may be considered (seek guidance from toxicologist prior to administration).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, arterial blood gases, respiratory and mental status, and obtain a chest x-ray following a significant exposure. Monitor blood glucose in symptomatic patients; hypoglycemia has been reported with life-threatening intoxications. Obtain an acetaminophen blood concentration. Tramadol plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Standard screening urine toxicology immunoassays will not detect tramadol, although it will likely be detected in a comprehensive urine toxicology analysis. No specific lab work is needed in most patients, but may be helpful in ruling out other causes of altered mental status if the diagnosis of opioid toxicity is uncertain. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with dysrhythmias or interval prolongation. Consider head CT and lumbar puncture to rule out intracranial mass, bleeding or infection if the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are of no value.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: There is limited experience. Treat seizures\/myoclonus (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol), support blood pressure with fluids and pressors. Intubate and ventilate as needed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage should be performed immediately followed by CSF exchange. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consider ventriculolumbar perfusion. Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours).  Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above the therapeutic dose. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than therapeutic dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Patients with deliberate ingestions or children with ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for observation for at least 6 to 8 hours, as peak plasma levels (Tmax of tramadol 50 mg is 1.5 hours and 2.3 hours for 100 mg for immediate release tablets) and thus symptoms will likely develop within this time period. Patients who are asymptomatic after 8 hours of observation and adequate gastrointestinal decontamination may be discharged after psychiatric evaluation as needed. Patients with recurrent seizures or persistent altered mental status should be admitted.  EXTENDED RELEASE: Patients that have ingested an extended release product (Tmax tramadol 200 mg extended release tablets was 12 hours and 15 hours for the active metabolite) have the potential to manifest symptoms in a delayed fashion and should be observed for 24 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous depression should be admitted to the hospital. Patients with signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome should be admitted. IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Patients needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as they may have taken a longer-acting tramadol product and may need additional doses. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, those needing a naloxone infusion or intubated patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. EXTENDED RELEASE: Patients with even mild to moderate opioid effects, and those who require naloxone after ingestion of an extended-release formulation should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923288-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>TRAMADOL <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULTS: In adults, 500 mg was the lowest dose associated with seizures, respiratory depression, agitation, tachycardia or hypertension.  Adult fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 2.65 to 8.2 g tramadol without coingestants. An adult with a tramadol overdose developed a Brugada ECG pattern. An adult survived an estimated maximal ingestion of 10 g, but had a residual moderate cerebral deficit. PEDIATRIC: A teenager developed multiorgan dysfunction after ingesting 6 g of tramadol, but recovered completely. Children have tolerated ingestions of up to 300 mg with mild toxicity, but experience is limited. Serotonin syndrome was observed in an 8-month old after ingesting 200 mg of tramadol; recovery was uneventful. Severe toxicity has been reported in infants who received 100 mg rectally. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT: Maintenance therapy: Administer 50 to 100 mg orally as needed every 4 to 6 hours; maximum daily dose is 400 mg daily. EXTENDED RELEASE: Administer 100 mg orally once daily; titrate as necessary by 100-mg increments every 5 days to relieve pain. Maximum daily dose should not exceed 300 mg daily. PEDIATRIC: The safety and efficacy of these agent have not been established in pediatric patients.<br\/>"}]},"13":{"id":"923288-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patient should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination until drug effects are realized, as this drug may cause dizziness, somnolence, and impaired mental and physical abilities.<\/li><li>This drug may cause pruritus, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, seizures,  and rarely hallucinations.<\/li><li>Instruct patient, family members, and caregivers to report worsening depression, suicidal ideation, or unusual changes in behavior.<\/li><li>Patient should report signs\/symptoms of serotonin syndrome (agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, hallucinations, hyperreflexia).
