Famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir. Ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and valacyclovir are covered in separate managements. Acyclovir and related medications are used for prophylaxis and treatment of herpes virus infections, including varicella infection. PHARMACOLOGY: These drugs are acyclic analogues of the natural nucleoside guanosine. They are activated via monophosphorylation by virus-induced thymidine kinase and then will undergo 2 additional phosphorylations. The triphosphate forms inhibit herpes viral DNA synthesis but do not inhibit DNA synthesis in uninfected cells because the initial phosphorylation only occurs in herpes-infected cells. TOXICOLOGY: At high concentrations, acyclovir precipitates as crystals in the urine, causing nephropathy. The mechanism for neurologic toxicity is not understood. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon; most reported toxicity is from high therapeutic doses. Severe toxicity is very rare, and there are no reported deaths from overdose. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients who ingest these agents in overdose experience only mild or moderate effects. The primary manifestations are nausea, vomiting, and headache. Renal injury has been reported. SEVERE TOXICITY: Most toxicity from these agents is from therapeutic or high therapeutic doses (particularly in patients with renal insufficiency) rather than inadvertent or intentional oral overdose. Neurotoxicity predominates and may include lethargy, confusion, ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, hallucinations, myoclonus, agitation, and in severe cases, seizures or coma. Renal failure can also develop and is usually transient. ADVERSE EFFECTS: ORAL: Nausea, vomiting, and headaches are common.  IV:  Adverse effects include neurotoxicity which resembles an extension of viral infection into the central nervous system.   Most commonly, mental status changes and involuntary movements occur.   Lethargy, fatigue, irritability, depression, agitation, occasional myoclonus with muscle fasciculations, hyperactive tendon reflexes, tremor, stupor and coma have been reported following intravenous acyclovir, particularly rapid infusions.  Psychosis and neuropsychiatric symptoms have also been described with IV acyclovir administration. Neurotoxicity is generally reversible. Local inflammation at injection site or phlebitis, renal injury and acute renal failure, agitation, coma, seizures, and lethargy may occur with acute or repeated administration to patients with renal insufficiency.  Obstructive nephropathy as a result of acyclovir crystalluria may develop following high-dose therapy.  Leukopenia has occasionally been reported as an adverse effect following therapeutic doses. TOPICAL: Mild pain, burning, stinging, and itching. OCULAR: Mild irritation.<br\/><\/li><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/>USES: Antiinflammatory agents used to treat a variety of clinical conditions, including adrenal insufficiency, asthma, various allergy disorders, and autoimmune disorders (eg, hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus). Corticosteroids are available in oral, parenteral, inhalational, and topical formulations. PHARMACOLOGY: Multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions. Anti-inflammatory effects result from decreased formation, release and activity of the mediators of inflammation (eg, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) which reduced the initial manifestations of the inflammatory process. The immunosuppressive properties decrease the response to delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, type III and type IV).  The antiproliferative effects reduce hyperplastic tissue characteristic of psoriasis. TOXICOLOGY: Corticosteroids decrease calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion, and inhibit osteoblast formation, leading to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute toxicity following overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Acute ingestion is rarely a clinical problem. Acute adrenal insufficiency rarely reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial fibrillation)(methylPREDNISolone), seizures (methylPREDNISolone), anaphylaxis. CHRONIC EXPOSURE:  Cushingoid appearance, muscle wasting and weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia, subcapsulary cataracts and glaucoma, osteoporosis, psychosis. ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL:  Dysphoria, irritability, emotional liability, depression, fatigue,  anxiety, depersonalization, myalgia, and arthralgia.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929630-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ACYCLOVIR AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients generally do well with supportive care. Nausea and vomiting should be treated with antiemetics. Rashes should be treated with supportive care, discontinuation of the offending agent, and consideration of antihistamines and corticosteroids. With massive overdose, hydrate patients and monitor renal function. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care remains the mainstay of care in severe toxicity. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines as first line therapy, followed by barbiturates or propofol, if seizures persist. Hydrate patients and monitor urine output and renal function. Airway protection should be employed as need for patients with coma.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: No pre-hospital decontamination is indicated. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be considered in patients with recent, large overdose if they are awake, alert, and willing to drink the charcoal. Gastric lavage has no role, as toxicity is not life threatening.<\/li><li>Airway management: Central respiratory failure is not expected with oral overdose of acyclovir. Patients with profound CNS depression or recurrent seizures require airway management, but this is exceedingly rare.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor renal function and urine output in patients receiving IV acyclovir with suspected toxicity or after massive oral overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Acyclovir and famciclovir have low protein binding and volumes of distribution, and can be removed by hemodialysis. Hemodialysis has been used to reduce serum acyclovir concentrations in patients with toxicity, but is rarely indicated as patients do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent ingestion of these products may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose and symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Patients should be observed for 6 hours, primarily monitoring signs of co-ingestant toxicity or development of significant CNS depression. Follow-up renal function tests should be obtained in patients with massive overdose. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admit patients with severe toxicity characterized by CNS effects or renal injury. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consider consultation with nephrology for patients with renal injury.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

If seizures occur, administer IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Serious toxicity is not expected after ingestion of corticosteroids alone, and prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely required. HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is not expected after overdose; gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. Activated charcoal should be considered after extremely large ingestions or if more toxic coingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe allergic reactions, but this is rare.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Monitor airway.

SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine laboratory studies are not likely to be necessary after acute overdose. Serum electrolytes and glucose are useful to assess for adverse effects from chronic therapy. Monitor vital signs, fluid and electrolyte status as indicated. Monitor neurologic status as indicated in symptomatic patients. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with a minor unintentional exposure who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms can likely be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Moderate to severely symptomatic patients and those with deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treated until symptoms resolve.
