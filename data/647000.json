In chronic cholestatic liver disease, ursodiol appears to reduce the detergent properties of the bile salts, thus reducing their cytotoxicity. Also, ursodiol may protect liver cells from the damaging activity of toxic bile acids (e.g., lithocholate, deoxycholate, and chenodeoxycholate), which increase in concentration in patients with chronic liver disease. <\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"647000-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"647000-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: 90%<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"647000-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic: first-pass   <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"647000-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: primary; Urine: very small amounts<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"647000-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>take with food<\/li><li>URSO Forte(R) scored tablets may be broken in halves; due to bitter taste, store broken segments separately<\/li><li>do not use incorrectly broken tablet segments of scored tablets<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"647000-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>improvement in serum hepatic biochemistries and symptomatic improvement of primary biliary cirrhosis (eg, fatigue, ascites, pruritus) may indicate efficacy<\/li><li>liver function tests (gamma glutamic transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels); every month for 3 months after the start of therapy, and then every 6 months<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"647000-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Capsule: 300 MG<\/li><li>Oral Tablet: 250 MG, 500 MG<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Actigall<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 300 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Urso 250<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 250 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>URSO Forte<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 500 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"647000-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"647000-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>CHENODIOL AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>USES: Chenodiol (chenodeoxycholic acid) and ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) are used for the dissolution of gallstones. Ursodiol is also used for the prevention of gallstone formation in obese patients experiencing rapid weight loss. PHARMACOLOGY: Chenodiol (chenodeoxycholic acid) and ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) are naturally occurring bile acids. Hepatic synthesis of cholesterol and cholic acid is suppressed by chenodiol. Suppression of cholic acid and the metabolite, deoxycholic acid lead to desaturation of biliary cholesterol, which leads to gradual dissolution of radiolucent cholesterol gallstones in the gall bladder. Chenodiol has no effects on radiopaque (calcified) gallstones or radiolucent bile pigment stones. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: At the time of this review, there is no acute overdose data available. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects (eg, diarrhea) observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: CHENODIOL: Dose-related diarrhea is the most common adverse effect of chenodiol. Nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, heartburn, anorexia, dyspepsia, and elevated liver enzymes are less frequently reported side effects associated with chenodiol therapy. Serious hepatic disease may occasionally occur in patients treated with chenodiol. URSODIOL: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, itching, hypersensitivity reaction, backache, dizziness, cough, and pharyngitis have been reported. Chenodiol has the pregnancy category X. <br\/>"},{"id":"647000-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CHENODIOL AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
