PHARMACOLOGY: Afatinib irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ErbB2), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (HER4; ErbB4), which results in downregulation of ErbB signaling and inhibition of proliferation of cell lines that overexpress EGFR and HER2. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Nausea, vomiting, asthenia, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, and elevated amylase (less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal) have been reported with overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (20% or greater): Diarrhea, rash\/dermatitis, stomatitis, paronychia, dry skin, decreased appetite, and pruritus. OTHER EFFECTS: Vomiting, hypokalemia, cheilitis, cystitis, renal impairment, conjunctivitis, elevated liver enzymes, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, ventricular dysfunction (eg, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, ventricular dilation). RARE: Hepatotoxicity with fatalities. <br\/>"},{"id":"930558-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AFATINIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias or severe respiratory distress.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. In patients with an afatinib overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Serum afatinib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs. Monitor liver enzymes and renal function after significant overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (approximately 95%) of afatinib.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of 1 or 2 extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than 1 or 2 extra dose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930558-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>AFATINIB<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been reported.
