The following agents are available in the United States: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. Atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin are also available in combination with other agents (atorvastatin\/amlodipine; lovastatin\/niacin; pravastatin\/aspirin; simvastatin\/ezetimibe; simvastatin\/niacin; simvastatin\/sitagliptin). PHARMACOLOGY: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, preventing conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate determining enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Ingestion of up to 6 grams of lovastatin has been reported without specific effects or sequelae. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not expected, unless a coingestant is present. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain, myopathy, myalgias, rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, dermatitis, diplopia, blepharoptosis (ptosis), ophthalmoplegia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have been reported in patients receiving statins. Other reported adverse effects (rare) include hyperkalemia (lovastatin), photosensitivity (simvastatin), dermatomyositis (simvastatin and pravastatin), limb compartment syndrome (simvastatin and atorvastatin), acute renal failure (lovastatin), pancreatitis (pravastatin and lovastatin\/gemfibrozil), chest pain (pravastatin), atrial fibrillation (simvastatin), vasculitis (atorvastatin), hemolytic anemia (lovastatin), thrombocytopenic purpura (atorvastatin), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (simvastatin), akathisia (lovastatin), extrapyramidal effects (lovastatin), nasopharyngitis (atorvastatin), upper respiratory infection (pravastatin), cough (pravastatin), lung fibrosis (simvastatin), peripheral neuropathy (lovastatin and simvastatin).<br\/><\/li><li><b>SITAGLIPTIN AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>USES: These agents (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin) are used to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals either as a monotherapy or in combination with other hypoglycemic drugs. PHARMACOLOGY: Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors exert their activity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by protecting the endogenous incretin hormones and enhancing their actions. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are incretin hormones released in response to meal intake to maintain glucose homeostasis. Although these agents share the same mechanism of action, they may have slightly different pharmacokinetics. TOXICOLOGY: Because DDP-4 inhibitors increase insulin release and suppress glucagon release in a glucose-dependent manner, they are not expected to cause significant hypoglycemia in normal subject unless coingested with other hypoglycemic agents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited data. Clinical events may be similar to effects reported with therapeutic use. SEVERE TOXICITY: Has not been reported. Hypoglycemia can occur when combined with other hypoglycemic agents. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Hypoglycemia, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection have occurred infrequently during therapy with these agents. Gastrointestinal findings, which included abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and constipation were similar to the placebo group. Rates of hypoglycemia with other agents known to cause hypoglycemia (ie, metformin or pioglitazone) was similar to patients taking placebo. However, the potential to cause hypoglycemia when used with sulfonylureas or insulin has not been adequately studied.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930021-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>LOVASTATIN AND RELATED DRUGS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary unless coingestants are involved. HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity has not been reported after acute overdose of these agents.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary.

Monitor serial blood glucose concentrations. Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor, change in mentation). Treat significant fluid loss with IV fluids; antidiarrheal agents as indicated. SEVERE TOXICITY: Limited data. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. DPP-4 inhibitors produce very low rates of hypoglycemia with therapeutic use. Following a significant exposure or if coingested with other hypoglycemic agents, monitor serial blood glucose concentrations. Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor, change in mentation). Treat with dextrose as necessary. Monitor neurologic function in patients with evidence of hypoglycemia. A baseline ECG may be indicated following a significant ingestion; repeat as necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Emesis is not indicated. Activated charcoal may be considered following a significant ingestion if the airway is protected. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered following a significant ingestion if performed soon after exposure and the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: If a large overdose occurs or coingested with other hypoglycemic agents, monitor blood glucose frequently. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor, change in mentation). Monitor vital signs and obtain an ECG in patients with large ingestions; clinically insignificant QTc prolongation has been reported at 8 times the therapeutic dose with sitagliptin. It has not been observed with saxagliptin.<\/li><li>Hemodialysis: SITAGLIPTIN: It is not extensively bound to plasma proteins, but has a moderately large volume of distribution; approximately 13% of a therapeutic dose may be removed by dialysis. LINAGLIPTIN: Extensively distributed in tissue with a relatively high protein binding; hemodialysis is not anticipated to be beneficial. SAXAGLIPTIN: Saxagliptin and its active metabolite are dialyzable.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child with an inadvertent ingestion of a single dose can be monitored at home if a responsible adult is present. An asymptomatic adult or adolescent with an inadvertent ingestion of 1 to 2 tablets of sitagliptin, saxigliptin and linagliptin can likely be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion or coingestion of other hypoglycemic agents should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients with hypoglycemia should be monitored until blood glucose is normal and symptoms have resolved. Patients may be discharged to home once symptoms have resolved and blood glucose or other laboratory studies are within normal limits and is cleared from a mental health standpoint. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any adult who becomes hypoglycemic and all children with more than a minor ingestion should be admitted. Patients with evidence of severe hypoglycemia or CNS effects should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in cases of severe poisonings or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated by a mental health specialist.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930021-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>LOVASTATIN AND RELATED DRUGS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULTS: LOVASTATIN: Single doses up to 200 mg of lovastatin have been well tolerated without significant adverse effects in adult human volunteers. Overdoses of up to 5 to 6 grams of lovastatin have been well tolerated; no specific symptoms occurred. SIMVASTATIN: The maximum reported dose of simvastatin ingestion is 3.6 g with no specific symptoms; recovery was complete without sequelae. CHILDREN: FLUVASTATIN: Two children (a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old) ingested up to 80 mg of fluvastatin. Vomiting was induced in the children, and no capsules were present in emesis; both children recovered without any adverse effects. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULTS: ATORVASTATIN: Initial dose is 10 or 20 mg once daily, may be increased up to a maximum of 80 mg once daily. FLUVASTATIN: 20 to 80 mg daily. LOVASTATIN: extended-release lovastatin is 20 to 60 mg daily, in single doses; regular lovastatin is 10 to 80 mg daily, in single or divided doses. PITAVASTATIN: 1 to 4 mg once daily. PRAVASTATIN: 10 to 80 mg daily, in single doses. ROSUVASTATIN: 5 to 40 mg daily. SIMVASTATIN: 5 to 80 mg daily. CHILDREN: ATORVASTATIN: Initial dose is 10 mg once daily, may be increased up to a maximum of 20 mg once daily. FLUVASTATIN: 20 to 80 mg daily. LOVASTATIN OR PITAVASTATIN OR ROSUVASTATIN: Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. PRAVASTATIN: 20 to 40 mg daily, in single doses. SIMVASTATIN: 10 to 40 mg daily.<br\/><\/li><li><b>SITAGLIPTIN AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: SITAGLIPTIN: Limited data. An elderly woman intentionally ingested 1700 mg of sitagliptin and was treated with intravenous glucose; hypoglycemia did not develop. Another elderly woman intentionally ingested 1800 mg and was given a regular diet; no symptoms developed. A dose of 800 mg did not cause toxic effects in healthy adults. Doses above 800 mg have not been studied. LINAGLIPTIN: Limited data. Single doses of up to 600 mg (120 times the recommended daily dose) administered to healthy subjects resulted in no adverse events. SAXAGLIPTIN: At doses of up to 400 mg daily (80 times the maximum recommended human dose) for 2 weeks, no significant adverse events occurred in healthy subjects. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: SITAGLIPTIN: 100 mg orally once daily as a monotherapy or in combination with metformin or PPAR(gamma) agonist (eg, thiazolidinediones). LINAGLIPTIN: 5 mg orally once daily in adults. SAXAGLIPTIN: The recommended dose is 2.5 to 5 mg once daily.
