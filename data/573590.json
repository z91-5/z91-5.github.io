PHARMACOLOGY: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. Like acetylcholine, it depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane, producing repetitive excitation of the motor end plate. With persistent depolarization, flaccid paralysis (phase l block) subsequently follows within 1 minute of an intravenous injection of succinylcholine. Paralysis is rapidly reversed due to hydrolysis of the drug by plasma pseudocholinesterase. With repeated or continuous administration, the depolarizing blockade can change to a phase II block where neuromuscular blockade resembles that of curare. It is characterized by tetanic facilitation and fed in the response to successive stimulation (\"train-of-four\"). Prolonged apnea may be observed. TOXICOLOGY: Inadvertent overdose or administration of succinylcholine to patients deficient in pseudocholinesterase is expected to cause prolonged paralysis and apnea. If the patient does not receive respiratory support, this will progress to hypoxia, acidosis, and cardiovascular collapse. Hyperkalemia is caused by excessive stimulation of postsynaptic neuromuscular acetylcholine receptors which are increased in number in patients with certain underlying neuromuscular conditions. Malignant hyperthermia is caused by various genetic defects involving skeletal muscle receptor\/regulatory proteins, especially the type 1 ryanodine receptor. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. Succinylcholine has rarely been used to commit homicide. While the incidence of malignant hyperthermia from succinylcholine is unknown, the observed incidence of malignant hyperthermia with patients receiving general anesthesia is between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 60,000. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In mild overdose, patients may demonstrate a mild prolongation in the duration of neuromuscular blockade. SEVERE TOXICITY: ACUTE TOXICITY: Inadvertent overdose or administration of succinylcholine to patients deficient in pseudocholinesterase is expected to cause prolonged neuromuscular paralysis and apnea. If the patient does not receive respiratory support, this will progress to hypoxia, acidosis, and cardiovascular collapse, bradycardia, hypotension, brady- or tachyarrhythmias, and cardiac arrest may develop. Severe hyperkalemia and ventricular dysrhythmias may develop in patients with underlying neuromuscular conditions or catabolic states. Malignant hyperthermia, characterized by abrupt onset of tachycardia, hypotension, muscle rigidity, metabolic acidosis and severe hyperthermia, may develop in genetically susceptible individuals. CHRONIC TOXICITY: Following prolonged administration of succinylcholine patients may develop a prolonged neuromuscular block effect that can last several hours (up to 12 hours in rare cases). ADVERSE EFFECTS: Muscle rigidity, prolonged myalgia, and raised intraocular pressure can occur during therapeutic use. Bradycardia, hypotension, brady- or tachyarrhythmias and cardiac arrest may develop. Severe hyperkalemia and ventricular dysrhythmias may develop in patients in catabolic states or underlying neuromuscular conditions, including extensive burns, traumatic muscle injury, paraplegia, hemiplegia, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, prolonged pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade, upper motor neuron injury or extensive denervation of skeletal muscle. Malignant hyperthermia may develop in genetically susceptible individuals. <br\/>"},{"id":"573590-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SUCCINYLCHOLINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Ventilate as clinically indicated.
