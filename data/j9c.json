A compensatory increase in secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary occurs (except in patients with ACTH-independent adenomas or carcinomas), necessitating glucocorticoid administration to maintain aminoglutethimide&quot;s effect .

Manifestations may be similar to acute adrenal insufficiency. ADVERSE EFFECTS - Drowsiness, morbilliform rash, nausea, anorexia, dizziness and headache are common.

If acute adrenal insufficiency is suspected clinically administer corticosteroids eg hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously over 3 hours followed by 10 mg\/hr infusion until patient can tolerate oral hydrocortisone. Dexamethasone should not be used as its metabolism is accelerated by aminoglutethimide.
