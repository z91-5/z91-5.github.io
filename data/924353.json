Urease is not present in mammalian cells. The presence of urease is an indicator that bacteria is present. On ingestion of C14-urea capsule, if gastric urease is present, the ingested C14-urea is split to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and ammonia (NH3). CO2 is absorbed into the blood and exhaled in the breath. Exhaled C14-labeled CO2 can be measured with a liquid scintillation counter to detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori bacteria in the stomach.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"924353-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"924353-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Stomach: variable<\/li><li>14C carbon dioxide: unknown<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"924353-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: variable, unchanged<\/li><li>Lung: variable, changed<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"924353-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>14C urea: 12 hours (hydrolyzed) to 40 days (non-hydrolyzed)<\/li><li>14C carbon dioxide: 15 minutes<\/li><li>14C: 40 days<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"924353-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>avoid handling capsule directly; swallow intact, do not chew<\/li><li>patient should fast 6 hours prior to testing<\/li><li>antibiotics and bismuth should be avoided for 1 month before, and proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate for 2 weeks prior to the test<\/li><li>patient should be sitting at rest during the test<\/li><li>administer with 20 mL of water, follow with another 20 mL water after 3 minutes<\/li><li>10 minutes after administration, patient should hold their breath 5 to 10 seconds and completely inflate collection balloon slowly with a straw; knot balloon neck and send to manufacturer for analysis<\/li><li>repeat the test or use an alternative diagnostic method in patients with negative results and signs and symptoms of Helicobacter pylori infection<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"924353-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"no specific monitoring has been determined<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"924353-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Pytest<\/b><br\/><ul><li>  Kit: 1 uCi<\/li><li>Oral Capsule: 1 uCi<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"924353-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patient should fast for 6 hours prior to the test.<\/li><li>Instruct patient not to handle the capsule directly as this may cause interference with test results.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report use of antibiotics and bismuth preparations within 1 month, and proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate within 2 weeks prior to the test.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
