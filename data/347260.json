Effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects. Severe delayed bone marrow depression has been reported following lomustine overdose. Other effects have included: delayed liver and lymph node enlargement, abdominal pain, ileitis, elevated liver enzymes, mental status changes and tachypnea following lomustine overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: BENDAMUSTINE: Hypersensitivity reactions (fever, chills, pruritus and rash) have occurred with therapy, but severe anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely. Myelosuppression is common, tumor lysis syndrome may cause renal failure. Rashes are common. CARMUSTINE: Hypotension, tachycardia and myocardial ischemia have been reported with high dose carmustine infusion. Thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia are common. Pulmonary toxicity may develop after carmustine therapy and may be dose related. Effects are more commonly reported in women and may present years after therapy. LOMUSTINE: Delayed myelosuppression is the most common and severe toxic effect. Pulmonary fibrosis has developed. Acute renal insufficiency and failure can develop. Nausea and vomiting are common.

This information was derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free NS or LR). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative-free NS or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP per liter NS or LR) or albumin 5% have been used for perfusion.

An adult died of multiorgan system failure after ingesting 1400 mg of lomustine. BENDAMUSTINE: Limited data.
