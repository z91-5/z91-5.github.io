This class includes: emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, abacavir, and tenofovir; zidovudine and didanosine are in this class but are covered in separate managements, and zalcitabine is no longer manufactured. These agents are also used in the treatment of hepatitis B infection and human T-lymphocyte virus (HTLV) 1 and 2. PHARMACOLOGY: The NRTIs terminate HIV RNA to DNA transcription by acting as substrates for the HIV reverse transcriptase and terminating DNA elongation. These agents prevent cell infection, but have no effect on already infected cells. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicological effects are generally extensions of adverse effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon and severe sequelae from acute overdose are rare. Adverse effects and drug interactions, however, are common. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: There are limited data regarding overdose of NRTIs. However, overdose appears to be largely well tolerated with very few reports of severe clinical effects despite over 2 decades of drug availability. Nausea or vomiting, neurologic symptoms (ie, ataxia, lethargy, nystagmus, peripheral neuropathy), signs of bone marrow toxicity (ie, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), or an increase in liver enzymes have all been reported in NRTI overdose or chronic toxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity has been reported after therapeutic use but not after acute overdose, and may be manifested by pancreatitis, hepatic steatosis, acute renal failure (ie, tenofovir), neuropsychiatric abnormalities, or acidosis. Chronic therapeutic administration may lead to mitochondrial toxicity leading to lactic acidosis, with or without hepatic microsteatosis. Pancreatitis, neuropathy, and myopathy often accompany the syndrome. Severe neuropsychiatric effects (ie, seizures, mania) have been reported. Lactic acidosis has been reported in patients receiving both single and dual nucleoside analogue (NRTI) regimens for HIV infection. This is thought to cause multiorgan failure and most commonly occurs in persons on prolonged (more than 6 months) therapy. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common adverse effects from all NRTIs are nausea, vomiting, headache, and malaise. Peripheral neuropathy and elevated transaminases have been reported with most NRTIs. Rash and hypersensitivity reactions are common and are usually self-limited when therapy is continued. Other adverse effects specific to each drug include: ABACAVIR: Hypersensitivity, nausea, vomiting, headache, and a possible increased risk of coronary artery disease. EMTRICITABINE: Rash, diarrhea, hypercholesterolemia, transaminitis, and mild rhabdomyolysis are common. Hepatic failure\/steatosis, neutropenia, and lactic acidosis are rare. LAMIVUDINE: Headache and nausea are common. Pancreatitis is rare. STAVUDINE: Peripheral neuropathy in greater than 60% of patients receiving over 4 mg\/kg daily. Lactic acidosis and transaminitis are common and do not require therapy or discontinuation unless severe. Dyslipidemia and insulin resistance have been associated with chronic stavudine and zidovudine. TENOFOVIR: Rash, headache, transaminitis, nausea, and vomiting are common. Hepatic failure\/steatosis, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, and lactic acidosis are rare. ZALCITABINE: Peripheral neuropathy, stomatitis, pancreatitis, transaminitis, and rash. <br\/>"},{"id":"923413-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AIDS ANTIVIRAL NUCLEOSIDES<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Supportive therapy remains the mainstay of care. Benzodiazepines or antipsychotics may be used for agitation or manic symptoms. Mild transaminitis can be monitored, discontinuation of therapy is not usually necessary. Therapy should be changed for persistently rising transaminases or evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Nausea and vomiting should be treated with antiemetics. Peripheral neuropathies are generally reversible with drug withdrawal and can be treated with pain management as needed. Asymptomatic elevation of lactic acid without systemic acidemia does not require discontinuation of the medication. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care is the mainstay of care. Aggressive fluid resuscitation should be initiated for severe lactic acidosis. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor may be considered for patients with agranulocytosis complicated by infection. Vasopressors may be necessary in cases with multi-organ failure. Withdrawal of the agent is imperative to improvement in severe adverse reactions. Riboflavin and L-carnitine may be useful in treating nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated lactic acidosis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: No prehospital decontamination is indicated. Prehospital care should focus on assessment of vital signs and general supportive care. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered for patients that present early after overdose if they are awake, alert, and willing to drink the charcoal. Gastric lavage has no role in the management of NRTI overdose.<\/li><li>Airway management: Respiratory depression is not expected with overdose of NRTIs. However, coingestants must be considered and airway protection should be employed as needed for airway protection.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for NRTI toxicity.<\/li><li>Acidosis: Treat severe metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.1) with sodium bicarbonate 1 to 2 mEq\/kg. Anecdotal evidence suggests that riboflavin and L-carnitine may be useful in reversing NRTI-associated lactic acidosis. Riboflavin has been used at a dose of 50 mg\/day orally or intravenously. L-carnitine has been used at a dose of 50 mg\/kg\/day as a 2-hour infusion divided in 3 doses for patients not receiving dialysis, or a continuous infusion of 100 mg\/kg\/day in patients receiving dialysis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes and hepatic enzymes. Monitor serum lipase in patients with abdominal pain or severe acidosis. Lactic acid concentration and serum pH should be monitored in acidotic patients. Cardiac failure, likely due to acidosis, has been reported; therefore, cardiac monitoring is recommended in the setting of acidosis or chest pain. Sources of infection should be sought in patients with neutropenias or significant acidosis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and whole bowel irrigation have no role in the management of NRTI overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Suicidal patients and those with symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility. Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent ingestion of NRTIs can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours, primarily monitoring signs of coingestant toxicity. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe toxicity should be admitted. Patients with severe lactic acidosis, hepatic failure, or renal failure should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Infectious disease should be consulted if a change to anti-retroviral therapy is indicated. Consult a medical toxicologist for patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923413-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>AIDS ANTIVIRAL NUCLEOSIDES<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A full month supply of many of these agents has been ingested in overdose without clinical effects, though toxicity can occur at therapeutic doses with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
