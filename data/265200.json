Profound hypotension (especially orthostatic) and shock are the most severe signs of toxicity following overdosage. ADVERSE EFFECTS: A transient episode of early hypertension may be noted prior to the onset of hypotension.  Hypertensive crisis due to sensitization by guanethidine to some indirect acting sympathomimetics (metaraminol and ephedrine) may occur. <br\/>"},{"id":"265200-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>GUANETHIDINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Consider activated charcoal if patient is able to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Support: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl 10 to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine.
