PHARMACOLOGY: Endogenous estrogens are mostly responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult female is the ovarian follicle. Estrogens bind to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues to activate pituitary secretion of gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone through negative feedback mechanisms. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Estrogens are widely used; however, overdose is rare and significant toxicity has not been reported after overdose. TOXICITY: Overdose effects include nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, dizziness, abdominal pain, drowsiness\/fatigue, and withdrawal bleeding in women. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Hypertension, edema, nausea, vomiting, migraine. LESS COMMON: Myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, anaphylaxis, cerebrovascular accident, and neoplasm.<br\/>"},{"id":"931280-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ESTROGENS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Acute toxicity is extremely rare from these compounds, except perhaps local effects from transdermal and intravenous or intramuscular administration. In terms of care for chronic use, the most immediate treatment would be cessation of use and then supportive care for associated symptoms. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Acute toxicity from estrogen use is not expected, and the mainstay of treatment would be cessation of use and supportive care of symptoms.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPTIAL: Toxicity is unlikely following acute single exposure of excessive amounts. Gastric decontamination is rarely necessary. HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is rare, GI decontamination is generally not necessary.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for estrogens.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine lab studies are generally not necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. In self harm ingestions monitor serum electrolytes, acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations. Monitor vital signs, particularly blood pressure. Monitor ECG in patients with cardiac symptoms or severe hypertension.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of benefit due to high protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with unintentional exposures can be watched at home with follow up with their regular physician as needed.  OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with significant adverse effects or deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admission is rarely necessary after acute overdose. Patients with severe adverse reactions (eg, strokes) should be admitted, and depending on the severity of their symptoms, may merit an ICU admission. Criteria for discharge include resolution or treatment of their symptoms. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931280-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ESTROGENS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
