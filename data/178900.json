They are sold as commercial pharmaceutical agents to treat medical conditions (eg, attention deficit disorder, narcolepsy, and obesity). Illicit amphetamines, such as hallucinogenic amphetamines, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate, are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Amphetamines are sympathomimetic agents structurally related to norepinephrine. They have greater stimulant effects than other catecholamines. Peripherally, amphetamines promote the release of norepinephrine from stores in adrenergic nerve terminals and directly stimulate alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. They also inhibit catecholamine metabolism by inhibiting monoamine oxidase enzymes. Centrally, amphetamines stimulate the cerebral cortex, medullary respiratory center, and reticular activating system. TOXICOLOGY: Overdose or chronic excessive use causes a sympathomimetic toxidrome (eg, tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, and, in severe cases, psychosis). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are common. Severe effects are rare but may be seen in large overdoses and chronic exposures. Diversion and abuse of pharmaceutical amphetamines is common. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Hyperactivity, diaphoresis, flushing, mydriasis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypertension, palpitations, tachycardia, chest pain, headache, hyperventilation, and confusion. SEVERE POISONING: Generally only seen after illicit use (usually by injection, insufflations, or smoking) of high doses. May cause hyperthermia (greater than 40 degrees C can be life-threatening), dehydration, severe hypertension, tachydysrhythmia, myocardial infarction, vasospasm, aortic dissection, cerebral vascular accidents, sudden cardiac death, pneumothorax, psychosis, seizures, ischemic colitis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hepatic failure, serotonin syndrome, delirium, paranoia, and coma. Rarely, severe acidosis, multiorgan failure, and death occur. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, dyskinesias, psychosis, and seizures. Dose response may be unpredictable. Chronic amphetamine abuse may result in cardiomyopathy, heart failure, malnutrition, weight loss, cerebral vasculitis, permanent psychiatric illness including depression and paranoid psychoses, bruxism, and infection. Amphetamine exposure to the fetus may cause neonatal withdrawal symptoms. An adult withdrawal syndrome has been described in chronic abusers, including severe depression.<br\/>"},{"id":"178900-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED DRUGS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most amphetamine related toxicity may be safely managed with supportive care that includes monitoring airway, breathing, and circulation, and control of agitation with benzodiazepines. Intravenous fluids may be needed for mild dehydration, and sedation for agitation. Charcoal may be indicated if recent ingestion, airway controlled, and low seizure risk. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe agitation requires aggressive treatment to avoid malignant hypertension, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and seizures. Large doses of benzodiazepines may be needed. Severe cases may require neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and active cooling measures. For tachycardia, treat with intravenous fluids, sedation. For severe hypertension unresponsive to sedation, consider IV nitroprusside. Rhabdomyolysis is best treated with adequate 0.9% normal saline; monitor CK, electrolytes, and creatinine. Diuretics and urinary alkalinization are not recommended. Ventricular dysrhythmias should be treated with standard ACLS protocols.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of potential for agitation, seizures. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal binds amphetamines. For oral exposures, consider charcoal administration if patient is able to drink safely, low risk for seizures.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if unable to protect airway, to control agitation, hyperthermia, and status epilepticus.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Psychomotor agitation: Sedate patient with benzodiazepines as necessary; large doses may be required.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Consider IV nitroprusside for severe hypertension unresponsive to sedation. DOSE: Start at 0.5 to 1 mcg\/kg\/min and titrate as needed.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (including core temperature) and mental status. Serum concentrations of amphetamine and related agents are not readily available or clinically useful. Urine toxicology screens may detect amphetamines as a class, but do not distinguish between pharmaceutical and illicit forms. False positive amphetamine results may occur after exposure to over-the-counter cold preparations containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. No specific lab work is needed in patients with mild clinical signs and symptoms. In patients with severe toxicity, monitor serum electrolytes, CK, renal function, and troponin. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Consider chest radiograph or CT to exclude pneumothorax or aortic dissection as clinically indicated. Consider a brain CT to exclude traumatic injury or cerebrovascular accident as clinically indicated.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not useful because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Inadvertent ingestions in asymptomatic patients, and pediatric exposures of commercial pharmaceutical agents within published pediatric therapeutic dose, who have no synergistic co-ingestions, may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions, synergistic co-ingestions, unclear history, symptomatic or intoxicated patients, exposure to doses outside published therapeutic ranges, or those in unstable social situations should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent or worsening vital sign abnormalities, continued or difficult to control agitation or psychosis, multiple seizures, cardiac ischemia, or dysrhythmias should be admitted. Intensive care unit is indicated for aggressive airway or cardiac monitoring. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (ie, progressive agitation, psychosis, dysrhythmias, malignant hypertension, hyperthermia), concerns about decontamination, or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"178900-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED DRUGS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Dose response is variable.
