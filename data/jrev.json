It is NOT indicated as first-line therapy for the treatment of epilepsy. It is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children 2 to 14 years of age. PHARMACOLOGY:  Felbamate is a structural analog of meprobamate.  Its mechanism of anticonvulsant action in humans is unknown.  In animals, it abolishes the hindlimb tonic extensor phase of maximal electroshock seizures, and elevates the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure threshold, as well as picrotoxin-induced seizures. These findings suggest that felbamate may reduce seizure spread and increase seizure threshold, effects predictive of efficacy in generalized tonic-clonic or partial seizures and absence seizures, respectively. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited.  In general, overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects at therapeutic doses. One patient, who ingested 12,000 mg in a suicide attempt, developed mild gastric distress and a resting heart rate of 100 bpm  A 3-year-old child developed restlessness, ataxia, tachycardia, crystalluria, and hematuria after ingesting 3.6 grams of felbamate elixir (232 mg\/kg). ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects reported, with an incidence rate of at least 5% and at least 5% greater than placebo, include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, constipation, abdominal pain, decreased weight, palpitations, tachycardia, leukopenia, otitis media, fatigue, headache, somnolence, insomnia, ataxia, depression, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, fever, diplopia, miosis, and taste perversion. INFREQUENT: Adverse effects that have been reported less frequently, but with a greater incidence rate than placebo, include chest pain, dizziness, anxiety, tremor, paresthesia, rash, dry mouth, purpura, hiccups, diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes, myalgia, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and abnormal vision. RARE: Thrombocytopenia, anaphylaxis. SEVERE: Aplastic anemia and liver failure are serious adverse effects that have occurred with felbamate therapy and have limited its use.<br\/>"},{"id":"jrevs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FELBAMATE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
