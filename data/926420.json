PHARMACOLOGY: Imatinib mesylate, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibits the abnormally functioning Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase which is produced by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality found in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in the Bcr-Abl cell lines and in the leukemic cells generated by CML. Imatinib also inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells, which express an activating c-kit mutation. In vitro studies demonstrate that imatinib is not entirely selective, as it also inhibits c-Kit and the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF) (including PDGF- and SCF-mediated cellular events). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, facial swelling, severe muscle pain, elevated serum CK levels, and elevated liver enzymes have been reported. Other expected effects include diarrhea and delayed myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia). ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Edema, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, rash, and fatigue. OTHER EFFECTS: Dyspepsia, anorexia, stomatitis, headache, dizziness, asthenia, paresthesia, cough, dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, pneumonitis, elevated liver enzymes, elevated serum creatinine, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, blurred vision, periorbital edema, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, pancytopenia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary edema, pericardial effusion, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. DRUG INTERACTION: Drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP3A4) activity, such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, may decrease the metabolism and increase concentrations of imatinib. <br\/>"},{"id":"926420-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IMATINIB <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes and IV fluids as needed. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Significant toxicity is not expected after imatinib overdose. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) to patients with neutropenia. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count. If febrile neutropenia develops, obtain cultures and begin antibiotics. Adjust antimicrobial therapy as indicated based on culture results and clinical and diagnostic (ie, radiographic) findings. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider prehospital activated charcoal after recent, large overdose if the patient is not vomiting and is alert and can protect the airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory disorder.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors if patients develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential for evidence of bone marrow suppression. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Neutropenic sepsis: If fever (38.3 C) develops during neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. For example: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. It has not been studied in the setting of chemotherapy overdose. In patients with a imatinib overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor renal function, CK, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Monitor serum electrolyte status in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Hematologic effects, such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia are relatively common during therapy of CML. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count for 3 to 4 weeks following an overdose. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An adult with an inadvertent, small exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. Inadvertent pediatric ingestion of more than a therapeutic dose for age and weight should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with myelosuppression should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.
