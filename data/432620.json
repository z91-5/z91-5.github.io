It is also indicated for adjunctive therapy in the management of incomplete or inevitable abortion. PHARMACOLOGY: The uterine myometrium contains receptors specific to oxytocin. Oxytocin promotes uterine contractions by increasing intracellular concentrations of calcium in uterine myometrial tissue, thereby increasing the activity of the calcium-dependent phosphorylating enzyme myosin light-chain kinase.  The effect is greatest during early labor at term due to the oxytocin receptor concentration which increases during pregnancy and peaks at term. TOXICOLOGY: Oxytocin has anti-diuretic effects and can cause hyponatremia in overdose. Large doses of oxytocin can cause excessive uterine contractions in pregnant women. It as a minimal effect on the uterus except near the end of pregnancy and midcycle of a woman's menstrual cycle.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Excessive dosage can cause uterine hypertonicity, spasm, and tetanic contraction. Extreme changes in blood pressure may be observed following administration of oxytocin, especially if given mistakenly as an intravenous bolus.  Inadvertent oxytocin epidural administration has been reported; transient hypertension was the only adverse effect noted. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe effects include uterine rupture, cervical and\/or vaginal lacerations, hemorrhaging, uteroplacental hypoperfusion, variable deceleration of fetal heart, fetal hypoxia, hypercapnia, or death. Antidiuretic effect of oxytocin can cause water intoxication with seizures, which can occur following large doses (40 to 50 milliunits\/min) of oxytocin infused for long periods. A woman developed severe hypotension and water intoxication after receiving a very large intravenous bolus injection of oxytocin instead of a continuous infusion. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported: nausea, vomiting, blood pressure changes (hypotension followed by a hypertensive period), water intoxication, hyponatremia (following continuous IV infusion), arteriospasm, cardiac dysrhythmias, premature ventricular contractions, seizures (secondary to water intoxication), fatal afibrinogenemia, headache, flushing, blurred vision and conjunctival hemorrhages, memory dysfunction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, postpartum hemorrhage, and anaphylactic reaction. Excessive dosage or allergic reaction can cause uterine hypertonicity, spasm, tetanic contraction, or rupture of the uterus. Severe water intoxication with seizures and coma have been reported with a slow oxytocin infusion over a 24-hour period. FETUS OR NEONATE: Bradycardia, premature ventricular contractions and other dysrhythmias, permanent CNS or brain damage, fetal death, and neonatal seizures have been reported due to induced uterine motility. Neonatal jaundice, retinal hemorrhage, and low apgar scores (at 5 minutes) have been reported after maternal use. <br\/>"},{"id":"432620-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OXYTOCIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive. Treat mild hyponatremia with water restriction and\/or 0.9% sodium chloride. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Manage severe hyponatremia with 0.9% sodium chloride; 3% sodium chloride may be necessary only with very serious toxicity. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines; recurrent seizures may require the addition of barbiturates or propofol. Consultation should be made with obstetrics and gynecology in cases of uterine hypertonicity or bleeding after use.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not required as oxytocin is administered intravenously or intramuscularly.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary if recurrent seizures secondary to hyponatremia develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension followed by a hypertensive period may occur. Administer normal saline 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Hyponatremia: Evaluate for hyponatremia and associated symptoms. Patients with mild symptoms can be managed with water restriction. Promote diuresis. Correct electrolyte imbalances and treat seizures. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms should receive 0.9% sodium chloride (rarely 3% NaCl in patients with very severe symptoms). The goal is slow correction; the serum sodium should not increase more than 2 mEq\/L\/hour in any 4-hour period or more than 15 mEq\/L per day. Rapid correction may cause central pontine myelinolysis. Monitor serum electrolytes, fluid intake and output, and urine volume and electrolytes.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes, especially sodium, to check for hyponatremia and water intoxication. A CBC, INR, and PTT should be ordered in cases of excessive vaginal bleeding. Monitor urine volume and osmolality to check for water intoxication. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring following significant exposures. The use of oxytocin to induce labor has been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal jaundice.  However, this may be the result of labor induction rather than a direct effect of the drug.  Monitor bilirubin. Monitor the fetus (ultrasound, fetal heart rate, and tocographic monitoring) following an overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: The effectiveness of hemodialysis following oxytocin overdose is unknown. Hemodialysis is probably not required as oxytocin is rapidly removed from plasma through the kidney and the liver.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management, and oxytocin is generally only used in the hospital setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with symptoms should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant symptoms and\/or abnormal vital signs should be admitted. Pregnant patients with symptoms of vaginal bleeding or contractions should be evaluated by an obstetrician\/gynecologist. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear. Obstetrician\/gynecologist should be consulted for any case of excessive uterine bleeding or contractions and in the case of inadvertent administration to a pregnant woman.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"432620-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>OXYTOCIN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Antidiuretic effect of oxytocin can cause water intoxication with seizures, which can occur following large doses (40 to 50 milliunits\/min) of oxytocin infused for long periods. A pregnant woman developed severe hypotension and water intoxication after receiving a very large intravenous bolus injection of oxytocin (a bolus of 25 Units of oxytocin instead of a continuous infusion of diluted oxytocin). She recovered after supportive therapy. Five cases of inadvertent epidural administration of oxytocin (0.04 to 5 IU in 4 cases and 10 mL (unknown dose and diluent) in another case) have been reported. Transient hypertension developed in one patient, in the others, no immediate adverse effects were observed.
