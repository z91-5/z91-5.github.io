Teriflunomide is the active metabolite of leflunomide and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. PHARMACOLOGY: Leflunomide, an isoxazole immunomodulatory agent, inhibits dihydrooratate dehydrogenase (an enzyme in de novo pyrimidine synthesis), and has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating activity. Teriflunomide, the primary active metabolite of leflunomide. Although the exact mechanism of action in multiple sclerosis is unknown, it may involve a reduction in activated lymphocytes in the CNS. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. A woman developed no adverse effects after inadvertently taking leflunomide 120 mg daily for 28 days. SEVERE TOXICITY: Chronic high doses of leflunomide (an average of 34 mg\/daily for 26 months) produced interstitial nephritis in one adult. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Leflunomide and teriflunomide have similar adverse effects. COMMON: Hypertension, reversible alopecia, diarrhea, rashes, and elevated liver enzyme levels. OTHER EFFECTS: Chest pain, nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, tenosynovitis, bronchitis, respiratory infection, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (rare), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (rare). Based on postmarketing experience, rare cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported with therapeutic use. Individuals with multiple risk factors may be at greatest risk. Rare reports of severe infections, including sepsis have also occurred, but may be confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy or comorbidity. REPRODUCTIVE: Leflunomide and teriflunomide are US FDA pregnancy category X, due to the risk of severe teratogenicity or fetal death. <br\/>"},{"id":"jtkbs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LEFLUNOMIDE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Myelosuppression has been reported. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal (50 g orally every 12 hours for 11 days) if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. DRUG ELIMINATION PROCEDURE: CHOLESTYRAMINE: Cholestyramine may also be used to accelerate the elimination of leflunomide or teriflunomide. Administer cholestyramine 8 g 3 times daily for 11 days (the 11 days do not need to be consecutive unless rapid leflunomide elimination is necessary).<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions (rare) or pulmonary toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors in patients who develop severe neutropenia or neutropenic sepsis. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Drug concentrations of leflunomide are not readily available. Monitor vital signs and liver enzymes. Monitor serum electrolytes and renal function in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor serial CBC with differential after substantial overdose. There are rare reports of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia after therapeutic doses of leflunomide.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Studies with both hemodialysis and chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis have shown that M1 is NOT dialyzable. Cholestyramine may enhance the elimination of the active metabolite.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted.
