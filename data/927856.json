The goal of treatment with miglustat is to reduce the rate of glycosphingolipid  biosynthesis so that the amount of glycosphingolipid substrate is reduced  to a level which allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase  enzyme to be more effective (substrate reduction therapy).   In vitro and in vivo studies have shown  that miglustat can reduce the synthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids.  In clinical trials, miglustat improved liver and spleen volume, as well as  hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"927856-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"927856-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Bioavailability: 97% <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"927856-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 83 to 105 L<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"927856-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Majority of drug is excreted unchanged in the urine<\/li><li>Systemic: Renal: unchanged   <\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"927856-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 6 to 7 h<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"927856-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>may be taken without regard to meals; capsules should be swallowed whole with water <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"927856-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>symptomatic improvement, reductions in liver and spleen volume, and improvements in Hb concentration and platelet counts are indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>platelet counts; periodically<\/li><li>renal function; particularly in elderly patients<\/li><li>neurological evaluation; baseline, then every 6 months<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"927856-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Zavesca<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 100 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"927856-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Tell patient to report any symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report the development of new or worsening hand tremors.<\/li><li>Side effects may include diarrhea; weight loss; stomach pain, gas, or bloating.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to take this drug at the same time each day.<\/li><li>Tell patient to follow dietary instructions during therapy.<\/li><li>Tell patient if a dose is missed, skip that dose and take the next dose at the usual time.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
