PHARMACOLOGY: Enfuvirtide, a fusion inhibitor, prevents viral fusion and entry of HIV-1 into cells by binding to the first heptad-repeat (HR1) in the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: At the time of this review, there are no acute overdose data available. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Injection site reactions (eg, erythema, induration, and pain), nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, lymph node tenderness, weight loss, sinusitis, cough, pancreatitis, and myalgias have been reported in clinical trials with enfuvirtide therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"927717-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AIDS ANTIVIRAL FUSION INHIBITORS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after an overdose.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary unless other toxic agents have been administered concurrently.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients should be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged.
