PHARMACOLOGY: Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric murine\/human monoclonal IgG1 kappa antibody directed against the CD20 antigen. It binds specifically to the antigen CD20, a hydrophobic transmembrane protein. The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro. In RA for example, rituximab induces depletion of peripheral B lymphocytes. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is rare. OVERDOSE: No overdose information is available. Symptoms are anticipated to be an extension of adverse clinical effects. ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are relatively common with rituximab infusions; symptoms appear to decrease with subsequent infusions. Hypotension, hypertension and conduction disturbances have been reported with therapy. Headache, asthenia, and dizziness are relatively common during infusions and usually are reported less frequently with each subsequent infusion. OTHER: Several fatal reactions have been associated with rituximab, which have included fatal infusion-related reactions (ie, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock), tumor lysis syndrome which may be associated with severe renal toxicity, and severe mucocutaneous reactions (eg, paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis). Electrolyte disturbances may also occur in patients that develop tumor lysis syndrome. Grade 3\/4 cytopenias (ie, lymphopenia, anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) have also been reported. Other events reported are hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, other viral infections, cardiac dysrhythmias, and renal toxicity. Hypersensitivity reactions (hypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema) have occurred with rituximab infusions, and typically occur with the first infusion. Some cases have been fatal. INFREQUENT: Infrequent reports of bronchiolitis obliterans and interstitial pneumonitis have occurred months after the completion of therapy. Conjunctivitis, transient ocular edema and visual changes have been reported infrequently with therapeutic use. RARE: Intestinal perforation and bowel obstruction have been rarely reported in postmarketing experience. There have also been rare reports of prolonged pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late-onset neutropenia. <br\/>"},{"id":"jt9zs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RITUXIMAB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited overdose data. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor vital signs and monitor for signs of infection. Hypotension and\/or hypertension may develop. Treat hypotension with IVFs as indicated. Cardiac dysrhythmias have been reported with therapy; cardiac monitoring is indicated. Monitor electrolytes, renal function and fluid balance. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Infusion reactions have been reported.  In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required. Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelet counts. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg, filgrastim, sargramostim). Thrombocytopenia and anemia have been observed with therapy.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL and\/or HOSPITAL: GI decontamination is not indicated because an ingestion is unlikely; administered via the parenteral route. For dermal exposures, cleanse skin with soap and water, and for eye exposures, flush with water.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: Monitor airway. MILD\/MODERATE: Administer antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factor in patients with severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours; transfusion for severe thrombocytopenia or bleeding.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs including temperature; monitor for infection. Assess respiratory and cardiac function if patients show signs of an infusion reaction. Cardiac monitoring is indicated. Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelet counts following an acute exposure; repeat as indicated. Obtain baseline electrolytes and assess renal function and hepatic enzymes after a significant overdose. Monitor fluid balance. Administration of rituximab can result in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases of PML. Observe patients for new-onset or changes in neurologic signs or symptoms and perform relevant diagnostic tests (eg, brain MRI, lumbar puncture).<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis may be indicated in patients that develop acute renal failure related to tumor lysis syndrome.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management.

ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved.

THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULT: Recommended dose for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is 375 mg\/m(2) via an IV infusion once weekly for 4 or 8 doses. Recommended dose for rheumatoid arthritis is two 1000 mg IV infusions separated by 2 weeks.
