PHARMACOLOGY: Fluoroquinolones inhibit bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase enzymes required for DNA replication, transcription, repair and recombination. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Dizziness, drowsiness, disorientation, slurred speech, nausea and vomiting. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea\/vomiting, diarrhea, headache, drowsiness, and insomnia. Seizures, hallucinations, elevated liver enzymes and renal toxicity are rare. Seizures appear related to predisposing factors. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and vasculitis have developed. WITHDRAWAL FROM MARKET: Grepafloxacin was withdrawn from the worldwide market in October, 1999 after reports of cardiovascular toxicity; QT prolongation had been associated with its use.
