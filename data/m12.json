ADVERSE EFFECTS: Thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity are dose-related side effects, occurring most commonly during chronic exposure, and may be a hypersensitivity reaction. Other adverse effects may include ventricular dysrhythmias associated with high serum levels following IV administration. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia and diarrhea have been reported during clinical use. Dose related increases in liver function tests and hepatic necrosis have been described during long term oral therapy.<br\/>"},{"id":"m12s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>INAMRINONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Activated charcoal.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs.
