PHARMACOLOGY: Olaparib is a polyadenosine 5-diphosphoribose polymerase enzyme inhibitor (PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3) that causes antitumor activity by disrupting cellular homeostasis of tumor cells and increased formation of PARP-DNA complex resulting in cell death. Increased cytotoxicity and antitumor activity is seen in cell lines and mouse tumor models with BRCA deficiencies. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose has not been reported. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects following therapeutic administration, occurring in at least 20% of patients during clinical trials included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, headache, decreased appetite, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, arthralgia, myalgia, back pain, dermatitis, abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis\/pharyngitis\/upper respiratory infection, and cough. LESS FREQUENT: Adverse effects that were reported less frequently in patients receiving olaparib during clinical trials included constipation, peripheral edema, dizziness, urinary tract infection, dysuria, leukopenia, stomatitis, peripheral neuropathy, pyrexia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, hypertension, dry skin\/eczema, pruritus, flushing, and venous thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism). RARE: Myelodysplastic syndrome\/acute myeloid leukemia and pneumonitis, including fatalities, have occurred rarely. DRUG INTERACTION: Olaparib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes. Concomitant administration with strong (eg, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ketoconazole) or moderate (eg, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil) CYP3A inhibitors may result in olaparib toxicity.<br\/>"},{"id":"931320-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OLAPARIB <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY:  Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) to patients with neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. <\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary unless other toxic agents have been administered concurrently.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors if patients develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours OR 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day SubQ once daily. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage.  Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, olanzapine).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Monitor for clinical evidence of bleeding. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor vital signs. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Serum olaparib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An adult with an inadvertent, small exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. Inadvertent pediatric ingestion should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with myelosuppression should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931320-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>OLAPARIB <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
