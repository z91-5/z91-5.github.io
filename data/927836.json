PHARMACOLOGY: Entacapone and tolcapone are selective and reversible inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). They block the COMT in peripheral tissues, thus preventing elimination of catecholamines and other hydroxylated metabolites, including levodopa. This activity results in greater and more sustained plasma levels of levodopa, leading to a more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. In a study, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness occurred in elderly volunteers after ingesting 800 mg 3 times daily of tolcapone. In studies, abdominal pain and loose stools were the most commonly reported adverse effects in patients receiving entacapone 800 mg 3 times daily for 7 days. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported following treatment with COMT inhibitors: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, anorexia, xerostomia, urine discoloration, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, dyskinesia, dystonia, akathisia, insomnia, drowsiness, headache, confusion, dizziness, hallucinations, increased sweating, rhabdomyolysis, paresthesia, dyspnea, sleep disorder, excessive dreaming, and elevated liver enzymes. Fatal liver damage has been reported following therapeutic use of tolcapone. A neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like complex has been reported in association with the abrupt dose reduction or withdrawal of these agents.<br\/><\/li><li><b>LEVODOPA\/CARBIDOPA <\/b><br\/>USES: Levodopa and carbidopa combination is used to treat symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (paralysis agitans), postencephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism which may follow injury to the nervous system by carbon monoxide intoxication and\/or manganese intoxication. PHARMACOLOGY: Levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, has the capacity to cross the blood brain barrier thus providing dopamine to the corpus striatum. Carbidopa is an inhibitor of aromatic acid decarboxylation which prevents the rapid decarboxylation of levodopa in extracerebral tissues making more levodopa available for transport to the brain. TOXICOLOGY: Cardiovascular and CNS effects are probably due to levodopa's immediate metabolite dopamine.  This compound at low serum levels causes hypotension and tachycardia due to stimulation of the dopaminergic and beta receptors. At higher levels alpha receptor stimulation overrides and hypertension is the result.  Dysrhythmias may occur due to stimulation of beta receptors in the heart. CNS effects due to excessive dopamine may be expected to include dyskinesias.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: The most common signs\/symptoms seen following acute overdose include confusion, agitation, diaphoresis, insomnia, anxiety, and excessive motor activity.  Other effects reported after acute overdose have included nausea, vomiting, sinus tachycardia, postural hypotension, restlessness, hypertension, dyskinesias, confusion, delirium, hallucinations, psychosis, xerostomia, urinary retention, mydriasis, increased CK, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and respiratory dyskinesias. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, dyskinesia (eg, choreiform, dystonia, facial tics, grimacing, head bobbing, torticollis, and choreoathetosis). OTHER EFFECTS: Anorexia, vomiting, somnolence, agitation, diaphoresis, insomnia, anxiety, confusion, postural hypotension, dizziness, hypertension, rash, delirium, hallucinations, psychosis, respiratory dyskinesias, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. A constellation of symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been described following withdrawal of levodopa\/carbidopa. Symptoms reported include fever or hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes, autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, and hyper- or hypotension.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"927836-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>COMT INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. NOTE: Vasopressors should only be used with caution in patients with symptomatic hypotension unresponsive to fluids and supine position, as COMT inhibitors may interfere with the metabolism of agents such as dopamine and norepinephrine and cause exaggerated or prolonged response.
