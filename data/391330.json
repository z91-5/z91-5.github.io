PHARMACOLOGY: Naproxen is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), leading to decreased synthesis of prostanoids. Naproxen, like other NSAIDs, has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. TOXICOLOGY: Prostaglandin inhibition is responsible for the gastrointestinal irritant effects and nephrotoxicity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning with NSAIDs is not uncommon but rarely severe. Naproxen overdose is uncommon in the United States since other NSAIDs are used more often. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Gastrointestinal effects (eg, dyspepsia, ulceration, bleeding) are most commonly encountered. Renal dysfunction, most often in elderly patients, may occur. Mild CNS effects include altered cognition, drowsiness, headache, and mood changes, especially in the elderly population. SEVERE POISONING: Severe poisoning is rare but can include CNS depression, hallucinations, seizures, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and metabolic acidosis. ADVERSE EFFECTS: CNS effects include drowsiness, headache, fatigue, and cognition disturbances, especially in the elderly. Gastrointestinal effects (eg, dyspepsia, ulceration, bleeding) are as common as with other NSAIDs. Renal dysfunction, especially in the elderly population, may be seen. Instances of agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and pancreatitis have been reported.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: If significant CNS depression occurs, consider orotracheal intubation for airway protection before giving charcoal. Give benzodiazepines for anxiety, agitation, delirium, and seizures. Be aware of the risk of renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of potential for somnolence and seizures.
