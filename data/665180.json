Naturally present in high concentrations in some foods. PHARMACOLOGY: Essential nutrient required for bone development, vision, reproduction, and differentiation and maintenance of epithelial tissue. Required cofactor for glycosylation of glycoproteins. TOXICOLOGY: High doses stimulate bone resorption and inhibit keratinization. Excessive doses are stored in hepatic Ito cells, which become hypertrophied and obstruct sinusoidal blood flow, eventually causing portal hypertension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is rare, with acute toxicity even more unusual than chronic toxicity. ORAL\/PARENTERAL TOXICITY: ACUTE: Ingestion or parenteral overdose may produce significant increases in intracranial pressure which may result in bulging fontanelles (in infants), nausea\/vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, blurred vision, irritability and other effects associated with increased intracranial pressure.  Exfoliation of the skin has also been reported. CHRONIC: Signs and symptoms of toxicity include: nausea\/vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, irritability, diplopia, headache, bone pain, alopecia, skin lesions, cheilosis and signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g. papilledema). Laboratory findings include elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, increased INR, hypercalcemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and periosteal calcification on radiographs. Increased opening pressure may be noted on lumbar puncture. BETA CAROTENE: There are no known cases of vitamin A toxicity associated with beta-carotene ingestion, although excessive beta-carotene ingestion may result in carotenemia (yellow skin discoloration). <br\/>"},{"id":"665180-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VITAMIN A <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: In general, doses of less than 300,000 International Units in children and less than 1,000,000 International Units in adults do NOT require decontamination.

Chronic Exposure: Obtain aminotransferase level, bilirubin, PT\/INR, and calcium concentrations.<\/li><li>Benign intracranial hypertension: The majority of patients with pseudotumor cerebri improve with discontinuation of vitamin A.  In rare cases, lumbar puncture with drainage of CSF may be required to alleviate symptoms.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Acute unintentional ingestions of less than 300,000 International Units in children and 1,000,000 International Units in adults do not require gastric decontamination. Acute pediatric ingestions of more than 300,000 International Units can be treated at home with gastric decontamination. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, and those with deliberate ingestion should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: ACUTE: Children who are symptomatic (ie, vomiting, irritability, bulging fontanelles, and other signs of increased intracranial pressure) should be admitted for observation. CHRONIC: Pediatric and adult patients with chronic hypervitaminosis A should be removed from the source of exposure and admitted based on evaluation of  liver enzymes, INR, electrolytes, neurologic status, and dermatologic problems.  The  need for admission is based upon the severity of clinical illness and laboratory abnormalities.
