PHARMACOLOGY: Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that produces therapeutic effects in patients with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The exact mechanism of how selective inhibition of pre-synaptic norepinephrine exerts effects in ADHD is yet to be determined. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive synaptic norepinephrine concentration. Tachycardia and hypertension may occur due to the excessive noradrenergic-mediated sympathomimetic syndrome. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Drowsiness, mild tachycardia and hypertension, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, erythema, rash, hyperactivity, drowsiness, dizziness, nystagmus, tremor, anxiety, hyperreflexia, headache, and agitation have been reported. SEVERE TOXICITY: Seizures have rarely been reported. An adolescent developed generalized seizures and prolonged QTc interval after ingesting 1.2 g of atomoxetine. Sinus tachycardia with mild QRS interval prolongation, generalized tonic clonic seizure, lateral nystagmus, tremor, and hyperreflexia developed in a girl who ingested 2.8 g of atomoxetine. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported following the therapeutic use of atomoxetine: increases in blood pressure and heart rate, somnolence, skin rash, pruritus, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, constipation, dry mouth, abdominal pain, dizziness, mood swings, insomnia, motor tics, paresthesia, somnolence, anxiety, sinus headache, allergic reactions (angioneurotic edema, urticaria, and rash), decreased libido, ejaculatory failure or disorder, dysmenorrhea, urinary hesitation, urinary retention, and\/or difficulty in micturition. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity has been reported with therapeutic use. <br\/>"},{"id":"jvqfs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ATOMOXETINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat dyskinesias and\/or agitation with IV benzodiazepines. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression or persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with persistent seizures or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG in patients with moderate to severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Atomoxetine is highly protein-bound and has a large volume of distribution, therefore it is unlikely that hemodialysis or hemoperfusion would be effective.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An adult patient with an inadvertent exposure to 100 mg or less, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who have ingested greater than 100 mg of atomoxetine, or greater than 2 capsules should be referred to a healthcare facility. Patients with a deliberate overdose, those who are symptomatic, and those who ingested an unknown amount of atomoxetine should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jvqfs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ATOMOXETINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A minimum toxic dose has not been established.

Generalized seizures and prolonged QTc interval developed in a 15-year-old who ingested 1.2 g atomoxetine.
