It is an alternative therapy for bacterial meningitis, brain abscess, meliodosis, rickettsial infections, typhoid fever, and invasive salmonellosis. PHARMACOLOGY: In therapeutic doses, chloramphenicol inhibits protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 50S and 70S subunit of the ribosome. It is bacteriostatic in most organisms, but bacteriocidal against H. influenza, S. pneumonia, and N. meningitidis. TOXICOLOGY: Chloramphenicol causes a dose-related bone marrow suppression, as well as idiosyncratic aplastic anemia. \"Gray baby syndrome\" of neonates (abdominal distention, vomiting, flaccidity, cyanosis, circulatory collapse, and death) occurs due to decreased metabolism of chloramphenicol in the immature liver. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Chloramphenicol is rarely used in the United States anymore, but remains the drug of choice for typhoid fever in several countries. Consequently, exposure and fatalities are extremely rare in the United States. Fatality rates as high as 50% have been reported in patients presenting with aplastic anemia or \"gray baby syndrome\". MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Chloramphenicol produces nausea and vomiting in overdose. Confusion and delirium, optic neuritis, and contact dermatitis can occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Myocardial depression resulting in cardiovascular collapse can occur within 12 hours of ingestion. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects include dose dependent bone marrow suppression that is generally reversible with discontinuation of therapy. Idiosyncratic aplastic anemia can occur; it is not dose-related, occurs within 5 months of treatment, has a 50% mortality rate, and confers a future risk of non-lymphocytic leukemia. \"Gray baby syndrome\" can occur in neonates receiving chloramphenicol. Affected infants exhibit vomiting, anorexia, respiratory distress, abdominal distention, green stools, cyanosis, ashen color, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse. Mortality rates as high as 40% have been reported, with most surviving patients exhibiting long term sequelae.<br\/>"},{"id":"119005-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CHLORAMPHENICOL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive including antiemetics, intravenous fluids, and discontinuation of exposure. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care including cardiovascular support with intravenous fluids and vasopressors if necessary. Discontinue chloramphenicol use. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) to patients with severe neutropenia, and monitor carefully for evidence of infection. Transfusion of packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe anemia. Consider hemodialysis or charcoal hemoperfusion in patients with severe toxicity and metabolic acidosis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: No prehospital decontamination is recommended. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if the patient is alert and protecting the airway. Consider gastric lavage in patients with known large overdoses.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients with respiratory depression should be intubated.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors to patients with severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days) and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 degrees C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin), or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Monitor serial CBC with differential. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes. Monitor neutropenic patients for clinical evidence of infection with particular attention to odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues (particularly in the perirectal region), exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Drug concentrations correlate well with toxicity, but are not readily available.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and charcoal hemoperfusion will decrease serum concentrations and may be of benefit in patients with large overdoses, severe toxicity and elevated serum concentrations, or in patients with severe hepatic or renal dysfunction. Exchange transfusion has been shown to lower serum concentrations in neonates.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with small inadvertent ingestions can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose, neonates who receive more than a therapeutic dose, and symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility. Patients should be observed for cardiovascular effects for 12 hours after overdose. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with hemodynamic instability, neutropenia, or severe anemia should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for patients with large overdose or significant toxicity. Patients showing signs and symptoms of bone marrow toxicity warrant a hematology consult.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"119005-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CHLORAMPHENICOL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Poorly defined.
