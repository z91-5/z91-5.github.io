Naftifine gel 1% is also used treat the same conditions caused by Trichophyton tonsurans. PHARMACOLOGY: Naftifine hydrochloride is a broad-spectrum, synthetic allylamine derivative antifungal agent. Its precise mechanism of action is unknown but apparently involves sterol biosynthesis via squalene 2, 3-epoxidase enzyme inhibition resulting in decrease of sterols, specifically ergosterol. Naftifine has both fungicidal and fungistatic activities. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: No overdose data are available.  Toxicity risk from naftifine is extremely low. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur primarily due to product emollient base. Refer to LAXATIVE-EMOLLIENT document for more information. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The primary adverse effects are burning\/stinging, dryness, erythema, rash, itching, local irritation, skin tenderness, and allergic contact dermatitis. <br\/>"},{"id":"8d22s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>NAFTIFINE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions  and any patient with more than mild GI distress after unintentional ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Hospital admission is rarely necessary. Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
