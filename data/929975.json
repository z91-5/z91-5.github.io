This class of laxatives include: citrate, sulfate, and tartrate salts of potassium or sodium. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Toxicity from overdose is rare. Chronic laxative abuse may occur in patients with eating disorders, Munchausen Syndrome or factitious disorders. PHARMACOLOGY: Saline cathartics are salts which retain fluids in the intestine by the osmotic action of the unabsorbed salt indirectly producing an increase in peristalsis. TOXICOLOGY: Saline cathartics are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract hence, systemic toxicity is unlikely unless massive amounts have been ingested. Large exposures can cause dehydration and electrolyte disturbances secondary to the osmotic effects. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The vast majority of cases are mild and patients experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. SEVERE TOXICITY: Saline cathartics are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract hence, systemic toxicity is unlikely unless massive amounts have been ingested. Severe effects may include dehydration, hypotension, hypernatremia, and electrolyte abnormalities. Hyperkalemia and ECG abnormalities developed in 2 patients after ingesting 6 tablespoons of cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate). EVENTS BY SYSTEM: CARDIOVASCULAR: A laxative withdrawal syndrome is described which is caused by persistent hyperaldosteronism and clinically manifested by edema. Theoretically, absorption of sodium could precipitate heart failure, but this has not been reported. GASTROINTESTINAL: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping are the most common signs and symptoms of saline toxicity. Patients with atherosclerotic disease receiving cathartics for procedural bowel preparation have been reported to develop ischemic colitis. Small bowel obstruction secondary to medication bezoar has been reported in patients taking laxatives chronically. GENITOURINARY: A mild diuresis may occur following excessive absorption of saline laxatives. FLUID BALANCE: Dehydration and hypovolemia may develop secondary to excessive diarrhea. ELECTROLYTE BALANCE: Hypokalemia may develop secondary to excessive diarrhea. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Typically, patients experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping.<br\/><\/li><li><b>MAGNESIUM <\/b><br\/>USES: Magnesium is available in many forms and has many different medical uses, including as an antacid and laxative, anticonvulsant, treatment of torsades de pointes, pre-eclampsia, management of acute asthma exacerbation, hydrofluoric acid ingestion, enema, and electrolyte supplement. Magnesium is an essential electrolyte in the body and is a cofactor in many enzyme systems. Industrially, magnesium is used as a component of aluminum alloys, in die-casting alloyed with zinc, to remove sulfur in the production of iron and steel, and for the production of titanium. PHARMACOLOGY: When taken orally, magnesium promotes bowel evacuation by osmotic retention of fluid which distends the colon and increases peristaltic activity. Parenteral magnesium decreases acetylcholine in motor nerve terminals and acts on myocardium by slowing rate of S-A node impulse formation and prolonging conduction time as well as stabilizing excitable membranes. Magnesium is also necessary for the movement of other electrolytes (calcium, sodium and potassium) in and out of cell. TOXICOLOGY: In overdose, magnesium impairs neuromuscular transmission, manifested as weakness and hyporeflexia. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Thousands of exposures occur every year, but severe manifestations are very rare. Severe toxicity is most common after intravenous infusion over multiple hours (usually for pre-eclampsia), and can occur after chronic excessive doses, especially in the setting of renal insufficiency. Severe toxicity has been reported after acute ingestion but is very rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea and vomiting are common with oral exposure. Flushing can occur most often with intravenous administration. Magnesium dust can irritate the eye and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract causing an atrophic nasopharyngitis. Metal fume fever can result from inhalation of magnesium fumes. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity occurs most often after intravenous infusions. It can also occur after chronic excessive oral doses, often in patients with renal insufficiency. Early manifestations are lethargy, hyporeflexia, followed by weakness, paralysis, hypotension, ECG changes (prolonged PR and QRS intervals), CNS depression, seizures, and respiratory depression. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects seen with magnesium sulfate include adverse effects on neuromuscular function and flushing (IV, dose-related), hypotension (IV, rate-related), and vasodilation (IV, rare-related). Magnesium sulfate may also cause diarrhea. Magnesium hydroxide has many drug interactions secondary to its antacid effect.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929975-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>LAXATIVES-SALINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In most cases, oral hydration and observation are all that is needed. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte abnormalities may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Significant systemic absorption does not occur so GI decontamination is not recommended.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is rare necessary; intubation should be needed as clinically indicated.<\/li><li>Antidote: No antidote is available.<\/li><li>Congestive heart failure: For patients with excessive sodium absorption and normal renal function, hypernatremia and volume overload can be managed with a diuretic such as furosemide (1 mg\/kg\/IV start with 20 mg in those naive to furosemide).<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Infuse isotonic fluids is usually sufficient in most cases. If hypotension persists, administer dopamine (5 to 20 mcg\/kg\/min) or norepinephrine (DOSE: ADULT: Infuse at 0.5 to 1 mcg\/min; CHILD: Infuse at 0.1 mcg\/kg\/min); titrate to desired response.<\/li><li>Hypokalemia: Monitor potassium if significant GI loss or dehydration. Replace potassium orally or intravenously as needed.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor electrolytes especially potassium and sodium closely in the case of massive overdose, severe diarrhea or those symptomatic patients with heart failure.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Generally, excessive sodium absorption will be renally eliminated. Enhanced elimination is generally unnecessary except in patients with renal failure and severe hypernatremia or volume overload.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients or those with mild diarrhea and inadvertent exposure can be managed at home. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant hypernatremia, confusion, dehydration, or hypotension should be admitted, observed, and carefully rehydrated. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose or severe diarrhea should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity. Severe toxicity is exceedingly rare.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>MAGNESIUM <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: For mild to moderate exposures, supportive care and removal of further magnesium exposure are the mainstays of treatment. Administer antiemetics for nausea and vomiting. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Administer intravenous fluids to promote magnesium diuresis. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: For patients with severe toxicity, treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. IV calcium chloride can be used to temporarily ameliorate respiratory depression until more definitive therapy can be instituted. Airway management may be necessary for patients with CNS depression or severe weakness. Emergent hemodialysis should be performed in patients with severe toxicity (dysrhythmias, persistent hypotension, severe CNS depression, and respiratory depression). INHALATION EXPOSURE: Move patients into fresh air and away from magnesium dust. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Wash exposed area with soap and water. EYE EXPOSURE: Irrigate eyes with water or normal saline and remove any particulate matter. INTRATHECAL EXPOSURE: Up to 100 mg of intrathecal magnesium sulfate has been used in anesthesia and is well-tolerated. After very large intrathecal overdose, immediate drainage of CSF (20 to 40 mL) should be considered. RECTAL EXPOSURE: Treatment is primarily supportive.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated as activated charcoal does not bind to magnesium. Wash exposed skin with soap and water; irrigate exposed eyes. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated as activated charcoal does not bind magnesium. Wash exposed skin with soap and water; irrigate exposed eyes.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation may be necessary if patients develop CNS, neuromuscular, or respiratory depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Monitor deep tendon reflexes (hyporeflexia generally precedes more severe toxicity), and monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, and serial magnesium concentrations after significant exposure. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients. Normal serum magnesium concentrations are 1.5 to 2.5 mEq\/L. At a magnesium concentrations of 3 mEq\/L, patients may experience nausea and vomiting. At a concentration of 4 mEq\/L, patients may have drowsiness, sweating, and unsteadiness. At 5 mEq, ECG may show QRS widening and PR prolongation. At concentrations of 6 to 7 mEq\/L bradycardia and hypotension may develop. Finally, at concentrations of 10 to 15 mEq\/L, voluntary muscle paralysis, heart block, and respiratory paralysis may develop.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is the most effective method to remove significant quantities of magnesium and may reverse life-threatening symptoms within 30 minutes. Emergent dialysis should be considered in any patients with severe toxicity (hypotension, dysrhythmias, severe CNS depression, respiratory depression) or patients with moderate effects and severe renal insufficiency.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients who are asymptomatic and exposures within therapeutic range may stay at home. Patients with minimal symptoms that are improving may also be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with systemic or moderate to severe symptoms should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation until symptoms are clearly improving and the patient is clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent weakness or magnesium concentrations that are not declining despite hydration should be admitted. Patients with hypotension, ECG changes, CNS or respiratory depression should be admitted to an ICU setting. Patients should remain admitted until symptoms are clearly improving and clinically stable. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for any patient with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Consult a nephrologist for hemodialysis in patients with severe toxicity. Patients with severe toxicity or renal insufficiency may require transfer to a hospital that can perform emergent hemodialysis.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929975-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>LAXATIVES-SALINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A toxic dose has not been established.

She required intubation and intensive supportive care but recovered despite a blood magnesium concentration of 38.7 mg\/dL. ORAL: Ingestion of 44 g magnesium or 750 mmol magnesium sulfate has caused symptomatic toxicity. An adult developed asystole but was resuscitated after ingesting 50 g Epsom salts (400 mEq magnesium). INTRATHECAL: A 22 weeks pregnant woman developed transient paralysis of her legs after receiving 2 mL of 50% magnesium sulfate intrathecally. EPIDURAL: Inadvertent epidural administration of 3 to 9 g magnesium sulfate did not cause toxicity. RECTAL: A woman developed acute magnesium toxicity (magnesium concentration: 7.1 mmol\/L) after administration and retention of a single magnesium sulfate enema containing 32.5 g magnesium sulfate. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: ADULTS: Dosing varies by indication. In cases of life-threatening conditions such as eclampsia, infusions of up to 4 to 5 g magnesium sulfate (98.6 mg elemental magnesium or 8.12 mEq elemental magnesium per gram) are given followed by 1 to 2 g\/hour continuous infusions.
