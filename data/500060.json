It is NOT approved for use in the treatment of night time leg cramps. Quinine has been used less commonly for chloroquine-resistant malaria. It has also been used as an abortifacient and as an adulterant in heroin because of its bitter taste. PHARMACOLOGY: Quinine has anti- and prodysrhythmic effects secondary to inhibition of cardiac sodium and potassium channels. It also can act as an alpha-adrenergic blocker. TOXICOLOGY: Inhibition of the sodium channels may result in widening of the QRS complex, and inhibition of the potassium channels may predispose patients to torsades de pointes. Alpha-adrenergic blockade may cause hypotension. Because of its oxytocic effects, it may act as an abortifacient. Quinine is directly toxic to the retina and causes inhibition of hearing by various mechanisms. It also inhibits ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells causing insulin release similar to sulfonylureas, resulting in hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. However, this is usually limited to high dose intravenous treatment. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Quinine exposure is uncommon; however, with severe exposure, manifestations are life-threatening. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In mild overdose, patients present with skin flushing, gastrointestinal upset, and cinchonism (tinnitus, deafness, vertigo, headache, and visual disturbances). SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients can develop ataxia, CNS depression, coma, seizures, respiratory arrest, hypotension, PR prolongation, QRS widening, QTc prolongation, ST depression, AV blocks, and various ventricular dysrhythmias. Cardiac toxicity resembles toxicity secondary to quinidine. Retinal toxicity may also result approximately 9 to 10 hours postingestion. Patients complain of blurred vision, tunnel vision, visual field constriction, diplopia, alteration in color perception, photophobia, scotomata, and frank blindness. Visual complaints usually resolve without treatment. ADVERSE EFFECTS: At therapeutic doses, patients often complain of skin changes, gastrointestinal upset, and various subtle neurological complaints, including headache, vision changes, and alteration in hearing. Quinine-induced thrombocytopenia appears to be immune mediated, may be life threatening, and usually resolves within a week of discontinuation. Hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura have also been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"500060-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>QUININE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is primarily supportive with IV fluids and antiemetics for gastrointestinal upset. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat QRS widening with ampules of sodium bicarbonate 1 to 2 mEq\/kg rapid IV bolus with a goal serum pH of 7.45 to 7.55 until QRS narrows. Treat torsades de pointes with 2 g of magnesium and aggressive potassium supplementation. Overdrive pacing may be necessary. Cardiovert unstable ventricular dysrhythmias. Type Ib antiarrhythmic drugs like lidocaine (50 to 100 mg IV in adults and 1 mg\/kg in children) may be utilized for ventricular dysrhythmias, but are often ineffective. Treat hypotension with IV fluids; add adrenergic vasopressors if hypotension persists. The management of retinal toxicity is controversial. It usually resolves without treatment. In general, stellate ganglion blocks are not effective. Oral vasodilatory drugs, nitrates, vasospastic drugs, and hyperbaric therapy have been utilized in some cases, but there have been no studies of efficacy. Treat seizures with aggressive benzodiazepine therapy; add propofol or barbiturates if seizures persist. Treat hypoglycemia with dextrose and consider octreotide (ADULTS: 50 to 100 mcg SubQ every 6 to 12 hours; CHILDREN: 1 mcg\/kg SubQ every 6 hours).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the ingestion is recent and the patient is not vomiting and is alert. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient is not vomiting and ingestion is recent. Consider gastric lavage for patients with massive, recent ingestions who are not vomiting and have a secure airway. Multi-dose activated charcoal can also be utilized (0.5 to 1 g\/kg every 2 to 4 hours) if the patient is not vomiting and airway is secure.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (ie, coma, CNS depression, seizures, or dysrhythmias).<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Specific laboratory studies for confirming quinine ingestion are not readily available in most clinical laboratories, and are not generally useful for guiding therapy. Monitor serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, CBC, CPK, urinalysis, and ECG. In the acutely ill patient, blood gas analysis may demonstrate metabolic acidosis. Lactate is also usually elevated.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no clinical role for hemodialysis or hemoperfusion because quinine has an extensive volume of distribution and is highly protein bound.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Home management is only indicate if the patient is asymptomatic, ingestion was minimal (therapeutic dose or less) and there is no suspicion for self-harm. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with an intentional ingestion, or a significant ingestion greater than weight\/age appropriate dosing, should be observed for 6 to 8 hours or until asymptomatic.
