Avoid use of GBCAs unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating systemic fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle, and internal organs. Screen all patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (eg, age greater than 60 years, hypertension, or diabetes), perform lab testing to estimate the GFR. For patients with the highest NSF risk, do not exceed recommended dose and allow a sufficient time period for elimination prior to readministration.<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"928353-s-3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"928353-s-3-9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"allergic or hypersensitivity reaction to gadolinium-based contrasting agents <br\/>"},{"id":"928353-s-3-10","title":"Precautions","mono":"<ul><li>diabetes; risk of chronically reduced kidney function and development of fatal or debilitating nephrogenic system fibrosis; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>elderly patients (greater than 60 years of age); risk of chronically reduced kidney function and development of fatal or debilitating nephrogenic system fibrosis; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>hypertension, chronic; risk of chronically reduced kidney function and development of fatal or debilitating nephrogenic system fibrosis; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>impaired drug elimination, known or suspected; increased risk of fatal or debilitating nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; avoid use unless diagnostic information is essential and alternative imaging not available<\/li><li>kidney injury, acute; high risk for fatal or debilitating nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; do not exceed dose and allow sufficient time for elimination before re-administering<\/li><li>nephrogenic systemic fibrosis which can be fatal or debilitating may occur in patients with kidney dysfunction; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>renal insufficiency, chronic and severe (GFR less than 30 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2)); high risk for fatal or debilitating nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; do not exceed dose and allow sufficient time for elimination before re-administering<\/li><li>repeated or higher than recommended doses of gadolinium-based contrast agents; increased risk of fatal or debilitating nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>arrhythmias have been reported<\/li><li>asthma, allergy, or other hypersensitivity disorders; increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>extravasation of gadobenate dimeglumine may lead to injection site reactions including pain, burning, swelling, blistering and necrosis; use caution to avoid local extravasation during IV administration<\/li><li>hemodialysis patients; prompt hemodialysis immediately following administration may be considered in order to enhance elimination<\/li><li>hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and fatalities; have been reported; discontinue use immediately and institute appropriate therapy if hypersensitivity occurs<\/li><li>interference with visualization of certain lesions has occurred; use caution when interpreting contrast MRI images in the absence of companion non-contrast MRI images<\/li><li>renal insufficiency; acute renal failure requiring dialysis or worsening renal function has occurred with gadolinium-based contrast agents; risk increases with increasing dose; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>report suspected adverse reactions, including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov\/medwatch<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928353-s-3-11","title":"Pregnancy Category","mono":"C (FDA)<br\/>"},{"id":"928353-s-3-12","title":"Breast Feeding","mono":"Micromedex: Infant risk cannot be ruled out.<br\/>"}]},"5":{"id":"928353-s-5","title":"Adverse Effects","mono":"<b>Common<\/b><ul><li><b>Gastrointestinal:<\/b>Nausea (1.3%), Vomiting (adults, less than 0.5%; pediatric, 1.4%)<\/li><li><b>Neurologic:<\/b>Headache (1.2%)<\/li><li><b>Other:<\/b>Fever (0.9%)<\/li><\/ul><b>Serious<\/b><ul><li><b>Cardiovascular:<\/b>Cardiac dysrhythmia, Chest pain (less than 0.5%), First degree atrioventricular block (less than 0.5%)<\/li><li><b>Dermatologic:<\/b>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis<\/li><li><b>Gastrointestinal:<\/b>Necrotizing pancreatitis, acute (0.1%), Vomiting, Worsening (0.5%)<\/li><li><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Anaphylaxis (0.1%)<\/li><li><b>Renal:<\/b>Injury of kidney, Acute<\/li><li><b>Respiratory:<\/b>Dyspnea (less than 0.5%), Pulmonary edema (0.1%)<\/li><li><b>Other:<\/b>Angioedema<\/li><\/ul>"},"6":{"id":"928353-s-6","title":"Drug Name Info","sub":{"0":{"id":"928353-s-6-17","title":"US Trade Names","mono":"Multihance<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"928353-s-6-19","title":"Class","mono":"Radiological Ionic Contrast Media<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"928353-s-6-20","title":"Regulatory Status","mono":"RX<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"928353-s-6-21","title":"Generic Availability","mono":"No<br\/>"}}},"7":{"id":"928353-s-7","title":"Mechanism Of Action","mono":"Gadobenate dimeglumine, a paramagnetic agent, produces a large magnetic moment which results in a large local magnetic field.
