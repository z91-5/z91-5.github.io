In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), patients are at a greater risk for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target Hb levels of 11 g\/dL and above in clinical studies. No trial has identified a Hb target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Therefore, in patients with CKD, use at the lowest sufficient dose is recommended. In cancer patients with certain tumor types (ie, breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, cervical), ESAs shortened overall survival and\/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in some clinical studies. In patients with cancer, use the lowest ESA dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions and serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions. Use ESAs only for treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course. Prescribers and hospitals must enroll in and comply with the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program (www.esa-apprise.com or 1-866-284-8089) to prescribe and\/or dispense epoetin alfa to patients with cancer.
