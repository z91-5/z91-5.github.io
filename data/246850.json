Persistent bone marrow suppression developed in another adult after a single 6 gram dose. VALGANCICLOVIR - Fatal bone marrow depression (medullary aplasia) occurred in an adult with renal impairment after receiving dosing that was 10-fold greater than recommended over several days. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: GANCICLOVIR - ADULT - 1 g orally 3 times a day; IV - up to 5 mg\/kg IV every 12 hours. INTRAVITREAL - 4.5 mg\/implant every 6 to 9 months. Renal dosing may be necessary. PEDIATRIC: Ganciclovir is not FDA-approved for pediatric patients. VALGANCICLOVIR - ADULT - up to 900 mg orally twice daily. Renal dosing may be necessarry.
