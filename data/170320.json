It is also used to chelate aluminum in renal failure patients undergoing dialysis. PHARMACOLOGY: Deferoxamine binds to iron that is not bound to iron-carrying proteins, forming an octahedral iron complex (ferrioxamine). Ferrioxamine is then excreted in the urine and bile, decreasing the overall amount of iron in the serum. TOXICOLOGY: The mechanism of rate-related hypotension caused by deferoxamine administration is poorly understood, but may be due in part to histamine release. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Deferoxamine use is relatively uncommon, and acute deferoxamine overdose is extremely rare. OVERDOSE: Hypotension is common at high infusion rates. Acute lung injury is common when high-dose continuous infusions are used for 24 hours or more. Pruritus, shortness of breath, chest pain, acute renal failure, and fatal acute lung injury have developed in patients who received inadvertent deferoxamine overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effect with therapeutic use is hypotension. Hypotension is predominantly rate-related. Less commonly, acute lung injury and ARDS have been described in patients receiving high-dose deferoxamine for more than 24 hours. Deferoxamine therapy has been associated with increased risk of infection with Yersinia enterocolitica; The virulence of the organism is facilitated when ferrioxamine acts as a siderophore for their growth. Zygomycetes, Aeromonas hydrophilia, and mucormycosis appear to also be more common. CHRONIC THERAPY: Uncommon adverse effects that occur more often in patients on chronic deferoxamine therapy include ocular toxicity (loss of color vision, visual field cuts, and pigmentary retinal degeneration), sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, dementia, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, bone dysplasia, and anaphylactic reactions. Acute renal failure and glomerulonephritis have been described in a handful of cases.<br\/>"},{"id":"170320-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DEFEROXAMINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment of mild to moderate toxicity predominantly consists of symptomatic and supportive care. Acute toxicity with hypotension commonly follows rapid IV infusion of deferoxamine. Administer intravenous fluids and reduce or interrupt the infusion. Reducing the infusion rate to less than 15 mg\/kg\/hour, with a maximum dose of 50 mg\/kg\/day, reduces the risk of hypotension. However, in the setting of acute iron overdose, higher doses may be required for adequate treatment. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with severe hypotension may require IV fluid boluses and the addition of pressors (norepinephrine or dopamine) to maintain blood pressure. Severe anaphylaxis should be treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. Patients who develop acute lung injury\/ARDS should have the deferoxamine discontinued and be treated with intubation and lung-protective ventilation strategies. The risk of acute lung injury\/ARDS may be decreased by discontinuing treatment with deferoxamine within 24 hours. Patients who develop severe Yersinia sepsis should discontinue deferoxamine therapy and begin empiric antibiotic treatment with intravenous therapy with a third generation cephalosporin, such as ceftriaxone (2 g\/day in adults or 100 mg\/kg\/day in 1 or 2 divided doses in children, to a maximum dose of 4 g\/day) combined with gentamicin (5 mg\/kg\/day in 1 to 3 divided doses) while awaiting culture results and sensitivities. Less severe Yersinia infections, such as gastroenteritis, may be treated with trimethoprim-sulfa while awaiting culture results.<\/li><li>Decontamination:  PREHOSPITAL\/HOSPITAL: Acute toxicity usually follows rapid intravenous administration, and deferoxamine is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary.<\/li><li>Airway management: Rarely, patients who develop acute lung injury or have anaphylactic reactions may require intubation for airway management.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and pulse oximetry. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, and urine output. Deferoxamine concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is effective at removing ferrioxamine in patients with renal failure.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: A majority of patients who receive acute deferoxamine therapy will already be admitted to the hospital. Patients on chronic home deferoxamine therapy who receive an inadvertent overdose should be evaluated in a medical facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop severe signs and symptoms of deferoxamine toxicity (hypotension, acute lung injury, anaphylaxis, Yersinia sepsis) will likely need to be admitted to an ICU setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or poison center for any patient with suspected deferoxamine toxicity (hypotension, acute lung injury, anaphylaxis, Yersinia sepsis). Patients with renal failure will benefit from a nephrology consult for possible dialysis. Patients with suspected Yersinia sepsis will benefit from an infectious disease consult to assist in tailoring antibiotic therapy.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"170320-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>DEFEROXAMINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Intravenous administration faster than 15 mg\/kg\/hr can result in hypotension. Acute lung injury has been associated with prolonged (greater than 24 hours) high dose (15 mg\/kg\/hour or more) infusions in patients with acute iron overdose. A 17-year-old adolescent developed acute renal failure and hypertension after an inadvertent dose of 45 g (700 mg\/kg) over 8 hours instead of the intended administration of 96 hours. No permanent sequelae was observed.

Duration of infusion is up to 24 hours in patients with severe poisoning. CHRONIC IRON OVERLOAD: ADULTS: IM: 500 to 1000 mg IM daily.
