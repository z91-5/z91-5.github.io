inhibits in-vivo and in-vitro melanoma cell growth with BRAF V600 mutation. Dabrafenib inhibits BRAF V600E kinases and other kinases, including BRAF V600K, BRAF V600D, and wild-type BRAF and CRAF kinases. When used in combination with trametinib, BRAF V600E and V600K are targeted and there is greater and prolonged inhibition compared with either drug alone. Some mutations in the BRAF gene, including those that result in BRAF V600E, can result in activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth; therefore, dabrafenib is not indicated to treat wild-type BRAF melanoma.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jxzvs8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"jxzvs8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Tmax, oral: 2 hours<\/li><li>Bioavailability, oral: 95%<\/li><li>Effects of food: decreased exposure (AUC 31% lower, Cmax 51% lower) and delayed median Tmax (by 3.6 hours)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxzvs8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Protein binding, plasma proteins: 97%<\/li><li>Vd: 70.3 L<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxzvs8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Liver: primarily<\/li><li>Desmethyl-dabrafenib: active<\/li><li>Hydroxy-dabrafenib: active<\/li><li>Carboxy-dabrafenib: inactive<\/li><li>substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, p-glycoprotein, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)<\/li><li>inducer of CYP3A4 (moderate) and may induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UDP glucorosynltransferases (UGT), and transporters<\/li><li>inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxzvs8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 23%, as metabolites<\/li><li>Fecal: 71%<\/li><li>Total body clearance: 34.4 L\/hr<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxzvs8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Dabrafenib: 8 hours<\/li><li>Dexmethyl-dabrafenib: 21 to 22 hours<\/li><li>Hydroxy-dabrafenib: 10 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}]},"9":{"id":"jxzvs9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>do not open, crush, or break the capsule<\/li><li>take at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal<\/li><li>do not take missed dose within 6 hours of the next dose<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jxzvs10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma confirmation with FDA-approved test; prior to treatment<\/li><li>tumor response indicates efficacy<\/li><li>serum glucose, in patients receiving dabrafenib monotherapy or in combination with trametinib; as clinically appropriate in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia<\/li><li>dermatologic examinations, in patients receiving dabrafenib monotherapy or in combination with trametinib; before starting dabrafenib, every 2 months during therapy, and for up to 6 months after discontinuation<\/li><li>noncutaneous malignancies, in patients receiving dabrafenib in combination with trametinib<\/li><li>signs or symptoms of bleeding, in patients receiving dabrafenib in combination with trametinib<\/li><li>left ventricular ejection fraction, in patients receiving combination therapy with trametinib; before treatment initiation, following 1 month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter<\/li><li>signs or symptoms of uveitis<\/li><li>signs or symptoms of skin toxicities and secondary infections<\/li><li>signs of hemolytic anemia, in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jxzvs11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Tafinlar<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 50 MG, 75 MG<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"jxzvs12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"jxzvs12b31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>DABRAFENIB <\/b><br\/>USES: Dabrafenib is used to treat unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults with BRAF V600E mutation. PHARMACOLOGY: Dabrafenib is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits in-vivo and in-vitro melanoma cell growth with BRAF V600 mutation. Dabrafenib inhibits BRAF V600E kinases and other kinases, including BRAF V600K, BRAF V600D, and wild-type BRAF and CRAF kinases. Some mutations in the BRAF gene, including those that result in BRAF V600E, can result in activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth; therefore, dabrafenib is not indicated to treat wild-type BRAF melanoma. EPIDEMIOLOGY: There have been no reports of dabrafenib overdose. OVERDOSE: Overdose of dabrafenib has not been reported. Extensions of adverse effects seen at therapeutic doses should be expected. In animal studies, dogs chronically administered 5 times the recommended human dose, or greater, developed coronary arterial degeneration\/necrosis with hemorrhage and cardiac atrioventricular valve hypertrophy\/hemorrhage. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse effects include hyperglycemia, hyperkeratosis, hypophosphatemia, headache, pyrexia, arthralgia, papilloma, alopecia, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). LESS COMMON: Other adverse effects occurring less frequently include hyponatremia, rash, back pain, and myalgia.

Monitor serum electrolytes including phosphate, liver enzymes and renal functions after significant overdose. Monitor serum glucose concentrations, particularly in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia. Monitor for signs of hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Children with unintentional ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted.
