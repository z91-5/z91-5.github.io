In a large trial that compared the safety of salmeterol, another LABA, or placebo added to usual asthma therapy, there was an increase in asthma-related deaths with salmeterol. This is considered a LABA class effect. Available data have not determined whether concurrent inhaled corticosteroid or other long-term asthma control drug use mitigates the increased risk of asthma-related death from LABA. Data from pediatric and adolescent trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization. Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, budesonide\/formoterol fumarate should only be used for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (eg, discontinue budesonide\/formoterol fumarate) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication.

Corticosteroids are available in oral, parenteral, inhalational, and topical formulations. PHARMACOLOGY: Multiple mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions. Anti-inflammatory effects result from decreased formation, release and activity of the mediators of inflammation (eg, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) which reduced the initial manifestations of the inflammatory process. The immunosuppressive properties decrease the response to delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, type III and type IV).  The antiproliferative effects reduce hyperplastic tissue characteristic of psoriasis. TOXICOLOGY: Corticosteroids decrease calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion, and inhibit osteoblast formation, leading to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute toxicity following overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Acute ingestion is rarely a clinical problem. Acute adrenal insufficiency rarely reported after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  Cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial fibrillation)(methylPREDNISolone), seizures (methylPREDNISolone), anaphylaxis. CHRONIC EXPOSURE:  Cushingoid appearance, muscle wasting and weakness, hypertension, hyperglycemia, subcapsulary cataracts and glaucoma, osteoporosis, psychosis. ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL:  Dysphoria, irritability, emotional liability, depression, fatigue,  anxiety, depersonalization, myalgia, and arthralgia.<br\/><\/li><li><b>SYMPATHOMIMETIC AEROSOLS<\/b><br\/>USES: Sympathomimetic aerosols are most commonly used for bronchodilation in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They also may be used to treat patients with lung irritation, allergic reactions, croup, and hyperkalemia. These medications may also be used for tocolysis during pregnancy. These medications include: nonselective beta agonists (epinephrine, isoproterenol), selective beta agonists that stimulate beta-2 or beta-1 receptors (albuterol, levalbuterol, arfomoterol tartrate, bitolterol, iseoetharine, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, reproterol hydrochloride, terbutaline), and amphetamine-like sympathomimetic aerosols (eg, levo-deoxyephedrine). These agents are rarely abused (injected) for their stimulant effects. PHARMACOLOGY: These medications achieve their effect via agonist activity on beta adrenergic receptors. Depending on the medication, some are more selective for beta-2 receptors while others have equal efficacy on beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. TOXICOLOGY: These medications exert their toxic effects via sympathetic activation via beta adrenergic receptors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Mild toxicity is common with the use of these medications. More severe effects are rare, especially if these medications are used correctly. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tachycardia, mild hypertension, tremors, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, mild hypokalemia and hyperglycemia, and premature ventricular contractions. DERMAL exposures would not be expected to cause significant toxicity. OCULAR exposures may cause mydriasis and mild systemic toxicity. ORAL ingestion of sympathomimetic aerosol preparations is unlikely to cause systemic toxicity as most of these agents are poorly absorbed via ingestion. SEVERE TOXICITY: More severe hypertension and tachycardia, persistent vomiting, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis, acute lung injury, life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, and myocardial infarction. PARENTERAL EXPOSURE: Systemic toxicity from injection of sympathomimetic inhalants has occurred and can cause severe toxicity and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects are common with the use of these drugs, and include elevations in blood pressure, tachycardia, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, tremor, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, bronchodilation, premature ventricular contractions, nausea, mydriasis, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and hyperventilation. PREGNANCY: These drugs do cross the placenta and may have negative effects on the fetus including heart rate and rhythm disturbances. In addition, interventricular septal thickness changes have been documented in fetuses exposed to these agents in utero. However, these complications are uncommon.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jwh8s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>CORTICOSTEROIDS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Seizures have been reported with IV pulse methylPREDNISolone therapy. If seizures occur, administer IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Serious toxicity is not expected after ingestion of corticosteroids alone, and prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely required. HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is not expected after overdose; gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. Activated charcoal should be considered after extremely large ingestions or if more toxic coingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe allergic reactions, but this is rare.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Monitor airway. Administer antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine laboratory studies are not likely to be necessary after acute overdose. Serum electrolytes and glucose are useful to assess for adverse effects from chronic therapy. Monitor vital signs, fluid and electrolyte status as indicated. Monitor neurologic status as indicated in symptomatic patients. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with a minor unintentional exposure who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms can likely be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Moderate to severely symptomatic patients and those with deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treated until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>SYMPATHOMIMETIC AEROSOLS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Many patients require no treatment beyond the discontinuation of the offending drug. Benzodiazepines may be used to treat agitation, tremors, mild hypertension and\/or tachycardia. Premature ventricular contractions usually do not require treatment. However, for patients with frequent or symptomatic premature ventricular contractions, checking and optimizing electrolytes is reasonable. Antiemetics may be used for patients with persistent nausea and vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Control agitation with benzodiazepines. For severe overdoses, the greatest concerns are cardiovascular and respiratory toxicities. For patients with cardiac dysrhythmias, correct electrolyte disorders (eg, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia). Treat unstable ventricular dysrhythmias with cardioversion, and antidysrhythmics like lidocaine and amiodarone. Hypertension and tachycardia typically improve with benzodiazepine sedation. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is the preferred agent, but other alternatives include labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine. Tachycardia may be treated with esmolol, but beta adrenergic antagonists should be used cautiously in patients with reactive airway disease or congestive heart failure, in addition, use of beta blockers may cause unopposed alpha effects (primarily hypertension), if the agent involved in the overdose has both alpha and beta agonist effects. In patients with severe respiratory distress, treatment includes orotracheal intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation. INHALATION EXPOSURE: Most of the treatment options above refer to inhalational exposure, as this is the most common mode of exposure for these medications. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Significant toxicity is not expected from such exposures, but simple decontamination with water or soap would be reasonable. EYE EXPOSURE: Significant toxicity is not anticipated, but simple irrigation of the eyes with water would be reasonable. PARENTAL EXPOSURE: Though not an intended mode of delivery, parenteral exposures with significant toxicity have been reported and should be managed similar to inhalational or oral toxicity, as appropriate. Inadvertent delivery of terbutaline subcutaneously has caused tachycardia, hypertension, and even ECG changes consistent with ischemia. There have been other reports of these agents being used intravenously for abuse, that caused agitation, tremor, hallucinations, amnesia, sweating, hypertension, tachycardia, and even hypotension, bradycardia and asystole.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: In general, there is no role for activated charcoal for oral ingestions of sympathomimetic aerosols due to their limited absorption via the gut. There is no role for dilution in any forms, and though likely not needed, it would not be unreasonable to wash skin for dermal exposures or irrigate eyes from ocular exposures. HOSPITAL: There is little to no role for activated charcoal for oral ingestions as these agents have limited absorption. There is definitely no role for gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation or multiple doses of charcoal.<\/li><li>Airway management: Though it is possible that sympathomimetic stimulants may cause acute lung injury due to massive catecholamine discharge in overdoses, airway management is usually not an issue in these patients.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for these exposures.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Patients who are asymptomatic do not need laboratory evaluation. Patients who experience cardiac manifestations such as tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, or dysrhythmias should be placed on a cardiac monitor and obtain an ECG, and evaluate electrolytes. Obtain a troponin level, if the patient is having chest pain. Perform a chest x-ray if the patient is experiencing respiratory symptoms. Patients with severe muscle pain should have a total CK checked to monitor for rhabdomyolysis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no specific evidence to support the use of dialysis, hemoperfusion, urinary alkalinization, or multiple dose charcoal.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients who are asymptomatic or who rapidly improve with cessation of the sympathomimetic aerosol(s) should be safe to manage at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who do not improve with cessation of the sympathomimetic aerosol or who experience worsening symptoms should be sent to a healthcare facility for further observation until they improve. Patients may be discharged to home after they show clear and consistent improvement of their symptoms. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who do not demonstrate improvement after a period of observation of several hours or who require continuing treatment with medications should be admitted to the hospital. Those with severe symptoms that require intubation or management of dysrhythmias or severe hypertension should be admitted to the ICU. Patients may be discharged once all medications have been stopped and their symptoms are clearly improving. CONSULT CRITERIA: Patients who are admitted to the ICU should receive critical care consultation.
