PHARMACOLOGY: The exact mechanism remains unknown. It may be able to block voltage-dependent sodium channels, augment the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate as some subtypes of GABA-A receptor, and antagonize the AMPA\/kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor TOXICOLOGY: Inhibits carbonic anhydrase, causing renal tubular acidosis and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. In most cases, acute exposure produced only minimal to moderate effects. Fatalities have occurred, but were the result of polydrug exposure. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Data limited. Drowsiness, dizziness, agitation, confusion, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, tremor, hypotension, depression, speech disturbances, impaired mentation, blurred vision and diplopia have occurred in overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Rarely, severe metabolic acidosis and coma have been reported after overdose. ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: The most common dose-dependent events associated with topiramate therapy include: paresthesia, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, dizziness, weight decrease, diarrhea, difficulty with memory and concentration and somnolence. Other events that occur less frequently but are likely dose-dependent include: anxiety, depression, hypoaesthesia, mood problems, dry mouth, confusion, involuntary muscle contractions, abnormal vision, and renal calculus. <br\/>"},{"id":"924096-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>TOPIRAMATE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
