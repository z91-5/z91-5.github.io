USES: MEDICINAL: Silver nitrate has been used for various conditions including burns, plantar warts, and mild inflammatory conditions of the eye, ear, nose, throat, rectum, urethra, and vagina. In low concentrations it is used as an antibacterial agent. It has been combined with sodium sulfadiazine to create silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream used topically to treat burns. Concentrations of silver nitrate greater than 1% have astringent, irritant, or caustic properties. Solutions of 10% up to 25% have been used to treat pruritus, impetigo vulgaris and plantar warts and solutions of 50% have been used in the treatment of granuloma pyogenicum, papillomatous growths, granulation tissue, and plantar warts. INDUSTRY: Silver nitrate is used in the manufacture of silver chloride, photographic sensitive materials, photographic plating, mirrors, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals.  It may also be used in photographic dark rooms. PHARMACOLOGY: Silver has bactericidal activity. Silver nitrate in concentrations between 0.5% and 1% are used as antibacterial agents. Concentrations of silver nitrate greater than 1% have astringent, irritant, or caustic properties. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure has occurred. Overdose is uncommon. OVERDOSE: Silver nitrate is a skin irritant that may cause dermatitis, rashes, burns, or argyria  (if exposures are chronic). It is a strong mucous membrane irritant-corrosive. Toxicity may be due to its silver component (argyria), its nitrate component (methemoglobinemia), and its corrosive nature. Silver nitrate is also a strong caustic and can cause tissue damage and necrosis. Silver can be absorbed predominantly through mucous membranes and burn wound surfaces. The irritant, astringent, or corrosive properties of silver nitrate are dependent on the concentration and duration of exposure. INGESTION: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as diarrhea may occur after ingestion. Dizziness and seizures have been observed after oral ingestions. INHALATION: The dust is a pulmonary irritant. ADVERSE EVENTS: Silver nitrate is a skin irritant that may cause dermatitis, rashes, burns, or argyria  (if exposures are chronic). Hypochloremia and associated hyponatremia may be seen due to reaction with chloride. Corneal opacification and bleeding conjunctiva have developed in newborns following the instillation of silver nitrate drops. Methemoglobinemia was noted in several burn patients who were treated with silver nitrate. <br\/>"},{"id":"548640-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SILVER NITRATE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor vital signs. INGESTION: Perform oral exam to assess for mucous membrane injury. A minor &quot;taste&quot; ingestions of silver nitrate may only require dilution. If no respiratory compromise is present, administer milk or water as soon as possible after ingestion. The ideal amount is unknown; no more than 8 ounces (240 mL) in adults and 4 ounces (120 mL) in children is recommended to minimize the risk of vomiting. Nausea and vomiting may develop following ingestion; monitor fluid status. Consider an endoscopy for a significant or suspected ingestion to assess for caustic injury. DERMAL: Remove contaminated clothing and copiously wash area with soap and water. Monitor electrolytes and\/or methemoglobin level in patients with evidence of systemic injury. OCULAR: Copious irrigation; perform slit lamp exam. Consider Ophthalmology consult for persistent symptoms. ARGYRIA:  If argyria develops, there is no effective treatment. Chelation therapy has not been found to be effective. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE ORAL TOXICITY: Endoscopy should be performed as needed in any patient with a silver nitrate ingestion and evidence of caustic injury. Early airway management in patients with upper airway edema or respiratory distress. METHEMOGLOBINEMIA: Determine the methemoglobin concentration. Treat patients with symptomatic methemoglobinemia with methylene blue (this usually occurs at methemoglobin concentrations above 20% to 30%, but may occur at lower methemoglobin concentrations). Administer oxygen while preparing for methylene blue therapy. METHYLENE BLUE: DOSE: ADULT OR CHILD: 1 to 2 mg\/kg\/dose (0.1 to 0.2 mL\/kg\/dose) IV over 5 minutes with a 30 mL flush of normal saline as needed every 4 hours. Improvement is noted shortly after administration if diagnosis is correct. Additional doses may be required. NEONATES: DOSE: 0.3 to 1 mg\/kg.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Esophagoscopy may be indicated due to the caustic nature of silver nitrate. In this setting, activated charcoal may obscure endoscopy findings.  Activated charcoal is NOT recommended in patients in whom significant gastrointestinal burns are likely (eg, presence of oral burns, persistent vomiting, drooling or stridor after ingestion). HOSPITAL: Dilution may be indicated in patients that can tolerate fluids. Activated charcoal is NOT recommended in patients in whom significant gastrointestinal burns are likely (eg, presence of oral burns, persistent vomiting, drooling or stridor after ingestion).<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support is unlikely to be necessary following a mild topical exposure with no signs of systemic toxicity. Aggressive airway management may be necessary in patients with a deliberate ingestion or any indication of upper airway injury. The presence of edema may make intubation difficult. An inhalation injury may produce respiratory difficulties resulting in pneumonitis or pulmonary edema; monitor respiratory function. Oxygen therapy as needed. Ensure adequate ventilation and perform mechanical intubation as needed.<\/li><li>Antidote: Chelators are ineffective in treating argyria or the other effects of silver toxicity.<\/li><li>Argyria of skin: There has been some success with hydroquinone (5%) to treat argyria. SELENIUM and SULFUR: These agents have been considered for the treatment of argyria. Selenium may act to precipitate or chelate silver; it is theorized that an increase in selenium intake can bind with silver for excretion rather than being deposited in the skin.<\/li><li>Injury of globe of eye: Copious irrigation; perform slit lamp exam. Ophthalmology consult as necessary.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor urea and electrolytes in symptomatic patients. Monitor methemoglobin levels in patients with symptoms of systemic absorption of silver nitrate or the presence of cyanosis. Following ingestion or suspected oral exposure to silver nitrate, endoscopy may be considered to rule out caustic injury. Obtain a baseline chest x-ray in a patient experiencing respiratory difficulties following an inhalation exposure. Obtain an ophthalmologic examination in patients with ocular symptoms after exposure to silver nitrate. It can also be used to detect exposure to silver nitrate as seen by deposits of silver in the eye by slit-lamp examination. Many methods exist to analyze silver; background serum levels of silver vary considerably but range from 0.04 mcg\/g of blood to 0.3 mcg\/g.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Enhanced elimination is unlikely to be necessary.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with an ingestion or a suspected ingestion of silver nitrate should be sent to a health care facility for evaluation. Patients with an endoscopic evaluation that demonstrates no burns or only a minor grade I burn(s), and who can tolerate oral intake can be discharged home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate acute ingestion should be monitored for signs and symptoms of caustic injury. Endoscopy should be performed as necessary. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, and those with endoscopically demonstrated grade II or higher burns should be admitted. Patients with evidence of respiratory distress, seizures, gastrointestinal bleeding, or large ingestions should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a hospital intensivist in patients requiring intensive care admission. Consult an ophthalmologist for patients with persistent ocular symptoms following irrigation.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"548640-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>SILVER NITRATE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ACUTE TOXICITY: The estimated acute oral fatal dose is approximately 10 g (form not specified) but 30 g has been survived. Silver nitrate is a strong irritant and would be expected to cause strong irritation or burns on skin and mucous membranes. ARGYRIA: On the average, argyria occurs after administration of 1 g of elemental silver by injection or 3.8 g of orally administered silver. METHEMOGLOBINEMIA: The most likely mechanism is conversion of nitrate to nitrite by organisms at the burn site resulting in methemoglobinemia in some patients.
