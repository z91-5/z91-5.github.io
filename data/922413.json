Fluvoxamine has essentially no abuse potential. PHARMACOLOGY: Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). TOXICOLOGY: The toxicity associated with fluvoxamine is likely due to an overabundance of serotonin activity after overdose or use with other serotonergic agents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Fluvoxamine overdose is relatively rare compared with other more popular SSRIs. Toxicity is usually very mild, especially if no other substances are co-ingested. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE: The most common toxicity in overdose is CNS depression. Symptoms of mild toxicity include drowsiness, tremor, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bradycardia, and anticholinergic effects. SEVERE: Seizures have been reported following overdoses equal to or greater than 1500 mg; however, this is very rare. One case of prolonged CNS depression after ingestion of 3 g of fluvoxamine has been reported. Serotonin syndrome (altered mental status, neuromuscular rigidity, and autonomic instability) rarely occurs with single substance ingestions of fluvoxamine; however, there is increased risk for developing potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome when multiple serotonergic drugs are ingested. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Sexual dysfunction has been reported at therapeutic doses. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may occur at low doses. Therapeutic dosing may decrease heart rate, but not to clinically significant bradycardia. Rarely, patients may exhibit increased suicidality after initiating fluvoxamine therapy. Drug discontinuation syndrome may rarely occur with cessation of therapy. Symptoms may include dizziness, lethargy, paresthesias, nausea, vivid dreams, irritability, and depressed mood.<br\/>"},{"id":"922413-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FLUVOXAMINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Supportive care is sufficient in nearly all patients. Antiemetics should be given if nausea and vomiting occur. Bradycardia does not usually require intervention; however, cardiac monitoring should be instigated for bradycardic patients. Investigation should be undertaken to assess for possibility of co-ingestants that may complicate the clinical course. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care remains the mainstay of treatment. Seizures should be managed with benzodiazepines. Patients with co-ingestants causing respiratory depression or loss of airway reflexes should be intubated. Hypotension is rare but should be treated with IV fluids and vasopressors if necessary. Patients with severe toxicity have likely ingested other substances. In serotonin syndrome, muscular rigidity is at least partially responsible for hyperthermia and death. External cooling and aggressive use of benzodiazepines should be used to limit morbidity and mortality. In severe serotonin syndrome, neuromuscular blockade with intubation may be required to relieve rigidity. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine with nonspecific serotonin receptor antagonism that has been used successfully in mild to moderate serotonin toxicity.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is generally not indicated. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal for recent, large (greater than 1000 mg) ingestions. Orogastric lavage and whole bowel irrigation are not indicated in fluvoxamine overdose. Each method carries some risk and fluvoxamine overdoses are usually not life threatening.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary unless co-ingestants that cause respiratory depression are present. Patients with CNS depression and normal respiration and airway reflexes should not be intubated prophylactically.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Administer IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Sedate with benzodiazepines. Consider cyproheptadine in patients with more severe manifestations who are able to take oral medications: ADULT dose 12 mg orally initially, then 2 mg every 2 hours if manifestations persist (maximum 32 mg in 24 hours), maintenance dose 8 mg every 6 hours. CHILDREN: 0.25 mg\/kg\/day divided every 6 hours, maximum 12 mg\/day. If hyperthermic, control agitation\/rigidity (benzodiazepines) and initiate external cooling measures (undress patient, cover with wet sheet and direct fan at skin). In severe cases, neuromuscular blockade (non-depolarizing agents) may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (including temperature) and mental status. Monitor ECG. Obtain salicylate and acetaminophen levels. Direct laboratory analysis towards ruling out more serious ingestions and conditions. Fluvoxamine concentrations are generally not available and do not correlate with symptoms.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to the large volume of distribution of fluvoxamine, methods to enhance elimination are not useful.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Children and adults with mild symptoms (eg, vomiting, mydriasis, diaphoresis, mild somnolence) following an inadvertent ingestion of up to 250 mg fluvoxamine can be managed at home with instructions to call the poison center back, if symptoms develop. For patients already on fluvoxamine, those with ingestions of up to 5 times their own single therapeutic dose can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back, if symptoms develop. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with an intentional ingestion or who develops more than mild symptoms should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. For fluvoxamine naive patients with ingestions of more than 250 mg and for patients on chronic fluvoxamine therapy with an ingestion of more than 5 times that patient's single therapeutic dose, prompt referral to a healthcare facility is necessary for evaluation and treatment. Patients should be observed for 8 hours. For ingestion of extended-release formulations, observation may be warranted for up to 10 to 18 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe CNS depression, signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and\/or co-ingestions of other more toxic symptoms may require admission. In general, patients will be asymptomatic within 24 to 48 hours. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for patients with severe toxicity or unclear diagnosis. Patients with signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome warrant aggressive management, ICU admission, and toxicology consultation.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"922413-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>FLUVOXAMINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Doses up to 1 g are generally well tolerated with only minimal or no symptoms.
