Hyaluronidase is also used for improvement in the resorption of radiocontrast media for urography if IV administration cannot be accomplished. PHARMACOLOGY: Hyaluronidase is an enzyme which hydrolyzes intercellular ground substance. It enhances absorption and diffusion of drugs injected concomitantly by decreasing viscosity and barrier action of these substances.  Hyaluronidase human recombinant is a purified preparation of the enzyme recombinant human hyaluronidase produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Hyaluronidase human recombinant is a dispersing agent which modifies connective tissue permeability through hydrolysis of hyaluronic acid. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose of hyaluronidase has not been reported. Extensions of adverse effects seen at therapeutic doses should be expected. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Purified hyaluronidase has little toxicity.  No cardiovascular, capillary, or renal effects have been reported following single large doses. Skin hypersensitivity is rare and it has low antigenicity. Nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension, dizziness, chills, urticarial reactions, local edema, and local ecchymoses may also occur during therapeutic use. Conjunctivitis, myopia, and astigmatism have occurred following subconjunctival injections of hyaluronidase. Postoperative periorbital swelling and inflammation have also been reported following periorbital injection of high concentrations of hyaluronidase. <br\/>"},{"id":"931043-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>HYALURONIDASE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
