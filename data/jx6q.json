PHARMACOLOGY: Aliskiren directly inhibits renin which decreases plasma renin activity (PRA) and inhibits the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) which indirectly increase levels of PRA, aliskiren reduces PRA, Ang I, and Angiotensin II (Ang II) by directly inhibiting renin. These reductions occur whether or not aliskiren is used as monotherapy or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents. It is unknown if aliskiren has an effect on other renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) components. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. The main effect expected with aliskiren overdose would be hypotension. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Aliskiren is generally well tolerated by most patients. Adverse effects reported with aliskiren therapy include hypotension (rare), diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal reflux disease, dizziness, headache, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. Most symptoms were dose-related, mild, and rarely led to discontinuation of therapy.<br\/><\/li><li><b>ANGIOTENSIN II ANTAGONISTS<\/b><br\/>USES: Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are used for the treatment of hypertension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are common, but toxicity is rare and deaths have not been reported following single-substance exposures. PHARMACOLOGY: Angiotensin II is an endogenous peptide that binds to angiotensin receptors, causing vasoconstriction and stimulation of aldosterone release. Angiotensin receptor blockers are competitive antagonists at these receptors. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive antagonism of angiotensin receptors causes vasodilation and hypotension. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild hypotension and tachycardia, hypokalemia, asymptomatic hypoglycemia, muscle cramps and dizziness have been reported. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity has not been observed with these agents. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Common adverse effects include hypotension and dizziness.

Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Correct any significant serum electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.
