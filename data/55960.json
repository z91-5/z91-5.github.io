Occasionally used as a drug of abuse. PHARMACOLOGY: Derivative of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA); acts at the spinal end of upper motor neurons, inhibits monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level. TOXICOLOGY: Presynaptic GABA-B agonist, in overdose causes CNS depressive effects similar to other GABA agonists. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Deliberate overdose is unusual. Inadvertent intrathecal overdose occurs rarely secondary to pump malfunctions or dispensing errors. Episodically used as a drug of abuse. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Lethargy, somnolence, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, delirium, nausea, and vomiting are fairly common. Mild elevations in liver enzymes, urinary retention, and incontinence are less common effects. SEVERE TOXICITY: Bradycardia, hypotension, coma, respiratory failure, seizures, mydriasis, flaccidity, and mild hypothermia may develop. Rare effects include status epilepticus, rhabdomyolysis, and first-degree AV block. Coma, flaccidity and loss of reflexes can last for several days after severe overdose and should not be mistaken for brain death. WITHDRAWAL: Abrupt discontinuation of baclofen (usually intrathecal), for any reason, can result in withdrawal symptoms, which have included hyperthermia, tachycardia, altered mental status (ie, hallucinations, delirium, agitation), exaggerated rebound spasticity, muscle rigidity, seizures, hypertension, and hypotension, and in rare cases manifestations may progress to rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ-system failure and death.<br\/>"},{"id":"55960-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BACLOFEN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most baclofen exposures require only supportive care.

Coma, flaccidity and absent reflexes can persist for more than 5 days after severe overdose and should not be mistaken for brain death.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended because of the risk of CNS depression and aspiration. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal, in patients who are alert or in whom airway is protected, for adults ingesting more than 100 mg and children ingesting more than 5 mg\/kg.

If intrathecal administration not possible, administer oral baclofen and supplement with intravenous benzodiazepines.
