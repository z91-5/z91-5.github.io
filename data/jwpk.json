These effects appear to be related to the formation of antibodies against bovine thrombin and\/or factor V which in some cases may cross react with human factor V, potentially resulting in factor V deficiency. The risk of antibody formation increases with repeated use. Patients with antibodies to bovine thrombin preparations should not be re-exposed to these products.<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"jwpks3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"jwpks3b9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"<ul><li>hypersensitivity to thrombin or components of bovine origin<\/li><li>direct circulatory injection; extensive intravascular clotting and even death may occur<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jwpks3b10","title":"Precautions","mono":"antibody formation against bovine thrombin and\/or factor V, may cross react with human factor V; potentially resulting in factor V deficiency and abnormalities in hemostasis, including bleeding or thrombosis <br\/>"},{"id":"jwpks3b11","title":"Pregnancy Category","mono":"Thrombin: C (FDA)<br\/>"},{"id":"jwpks3b12","title":"Breast Feeding","mono":"Thrombin: Micromedex: Infant risk cannot be ruled out.<br\/>"}]},"5":{"id":"jwpks5","title":"Adverse Effects","mono":"<b>Common<\/b><br\/><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Hypersensitivity reaction<br\/><b>Serious<\/b><br\/><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Antibody development (rare)<br\/>"},"6":{"id":"jwpks6","title":"Drug Name Info","sub":{"0":{"id":"jwpks6b17","title":"US Trade Names","mono":"Thrombin-JMI<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"jwpks6b19","title":"Class","mono":"Hemostatic<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"jwpks6b20","title":"Regulatory Status","mono":"RX<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"jwpks6b21","title":"Generic Availability","mono":"No<br\/>"}}},"7":{"id":"jwpks7","title":"Mechanism Of Action","mono":"Thrombin is a protein substance of bovine origin that immediately clots the fibrinogen of the blood without the aid of a physiological agent.<br\/>"},"9":{"id":"jwpks9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>for topical use only; do NOT inject, as intravascular clotting and death may result<br\/><\/li><li><b>Topical<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(powder) may be used dry or reconstituted<\/li><li>reconstitute with NS to a recommended concentration of 1000 to 2000 units\/mL; solution may be diluted with NS to other concentrations as needed<\/li><li>(spray kit) do not transfer spray pump to another vial<\/li><li>sponge recipient surface free of blood before application; do not wipe<\/li><li>spray or flood surface with solution or powder; or use absorbable gelatin sponges saturated with solution and hold in place with a pledget of cotton or small gauze sponge until hemostasis occurs<\/li><li>do not sponge treated surface to assure clot remains in place<\/li><li>use solutions promptly or store refrigerated for up to 3 h<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jwpks10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>hemostasis<\/li><li>signs of abnormalities in hemostasis<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jwpks11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Thrombin-JMI<\/b><br\/>Topical Powder for Solution: 5000 IU, 20000 IU<br\/>"}}}
