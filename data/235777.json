Overdose effects are expected to be an extension of adverse effects reported with high dose therapeutic use. Irreversible central nervous system toxicity (blindness, coma and death), and severe bone marrow suppression (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia) have resulted from high dose fludarabine. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most commonly reported adverse effects are myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), fever, chills, serious opportunistic infections (usually manifesting as pneumonia), nausea and vomiting, malaise, fatigue, anorexia and weakness. Neurologic effects such as agitation, confusion, visual disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, and coma have also been reported. Pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions (dyspnea, cough, and interstitial pulmonary infiltrate) can occur. In postmarketing experience, severe pulmonary toxicity has developed which has included ARDS, respiratory distress, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure. Edema is frequently reported. Life-threatening autoimmune hemolytic anemia has also been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"235777-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FLUDARABINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Administered intravenously; ingestion is unlikely.<\/li><li>Support: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: May be managed with antiemetics.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factor.

Keep patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free 0.9% saline).  Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter as soon as possible and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 24 hr or more).  FFP (25 mL FFP\/liter NS) or albumin 5% should be added to the solution used for perfusion; may increase fludarabine removal because it is 19% to 29% protein bound.
