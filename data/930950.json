PHARMACOLOGY: Vorapaxar inhibits thrombin-induced and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation. Vorapaxar reversibly inhibits protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), although its long half-life makes it effectively irreversible. Vorapaxar does not appear to affect coagulation parameters, nor does it inhibit platelet aggregation due to adenosine diphosphate, collagen, or thromboxane mimetic activities. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: At the time of this review, overdose has not been reported. It is anticipated that overdose effects are an extension of adverse effects observed with therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effect reported is bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding. INFREQUENT: Adverse effects that were reported less frequently include anemia, depression, dermatological reactions (ie, rashes, eruptions, and exanthema), iron deficiency, retinopathy, and diplopia and other oculomotor disturbances.<br\/>"},{"id":"930950-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VORAPAXAR<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no known treatment to reverse the antiplatelet effect of vorapaxar. Platelet transfusion is not expected to be beneficial. Monitor serial CBC with differential. Whole blood or packed red blood cell transfusions as needed for moderate or severe bleeding.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe bleeding, including intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count following an overdose. Monitor for clinical evidence of bleeding. Monitor serial hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients with suspected bleeding. Obtain head CT in patients with suspected intracranial bleeding. Routine serum coagulation profiles are not clinically useful in determining vorapaxar effect or toxicity in overdose; however, they may be useful to determine baseline coagulation deficiencies from pre-existing disease and\/or coagulopathy caused by co-ingestions. Serum vorapaxar concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. The duration of observation is unknown as vorapaxar has an effective half-life of 3 to 4 days and an apparent terminal elimination half-life of 8 days. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with moderate or severe bleeding, requiring therapeutic intervention, should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA:  Consult a Poison Center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or for whom diagnosis is unclear.  A hematology consult should also be considered.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930950-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>VORAPAXAR<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Toxic dose has not been established.
