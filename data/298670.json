Blockade of the Fc receptor on macrophages on the reticuloendothelial system in patients with immune cytopenia (e.g., idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP]), appears to account for the major immediate effects of IVIG. The more long-term effects of IVIG can be attributed to the immunomodulatory effects of IVIG on T cells and macrophages, particularly cytokine synthesis, and B-cell immune function and its regulatory action on the membrane-damaging components of the complement system. In contrast, the effects of IVIG in Kawasaki disease and perhaps other diseases may be caused by the presence of specific antibodies in the IVIG that are capable of neutralizing bacterial or even viral toxins that can have profound effects on the host's immune and inflammatory systems . Undoubtedly no single mechanism accounts for all of the immune modulating effects of IVIG in these inflammatory\/autoimmune processes .<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"298670-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"298670-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Tmax, SubQ: 2.9 days <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"298670-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Dialyzable: Unknown (hemodialysis);
