PHARMACOLOGY: Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors exert their activity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by protecting the endogenous incretin hormones and enhancing their actions. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are incretin hormones released in response to meal intake to maintain glucose homeostasis. Although these agents share the same mechanism of action, they may have slightly different pharmacokinetics. TOXICOLOGY: Because DDP-4 inhibitors increase insulin release and suppress glucagon release in a glucose-dependent manner, they are not expected to cause significant hypoglycemia in normal subject unless coingested with other hypoglycemic agents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited data. Clinical events may be similar to effects reported with therapeutic use. SEVERE TOXICITY: Has not been reported. Hypoglycemia can occur when combined with other hypoglycemic agents. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Hypoglycemia, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection have occurred infrequently during therapy with these agents. Gastrointestinal findings, which included abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and constipation were similar to the placebo group. Rates of hypoglycemia with other agents known to cause hypoglycemia (ie, metformin or pioglitazone) was similar to patients taking placebo. However, the potential to cause hypoglycemia when used with sulfonylureas or insulin has not been adequately studied. <br\/>"},{"id":"930755-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SITAGLIPTIN AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Although dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors produce very low rates of hypoglycemia with therapeutic use, hypoglycemia may develop after large overdose or if coingested with other hypoglycemic agents. Monitor serial blood glucose concentrations. Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor, change in mentation). Treat significant fluid loss with IV fluids; antidiarrheal agents as indicated. SEVERE TOXICITY: Limited data. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. DPP-4 inhibitors produce very low rates of hypoglycemia with therapeutic use. Following a significant exposure or if coingested with other hypoglycemic agents, monitor serial blood glucose concentrations. Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor, change in mentation). Treat with dextrose as necessary. Monitor neurologic function in patients with evidence of hypoglycemia. A baseline ECG may be indicated following a significant ingestion; repeat as necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Emesis is not indicated. Activated charcoal may be considered following a significant ingestion if the airway is protected. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered following a significant ingestion if performed soon after exposure and the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: If a large overdose occurs or coingested with other hypoglycemic agents, monitor blood glucose frequently. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor, change in mentation). Monitor vital signs and obtain an ECG in patients with large ingestions; clinically insignificant QTc prolongation has been reported at 8 times the therapeutic dose with sitagliptin. It has not been observed with saxagliptin.<\/li><li>Hemodialysis: SITAGLIPTIN: It is not extensively bound to plasma proteins, but has a moderately large volume of distribution; approximately 13% of a therapeutic dose may be removed by dialysis. LINAGLIPTIN: Extensively distributed in tissue with a relatively high protein binding; hemodialysis is not anticipated to be beneficial. SAXAGLIPTIN: Saxagliptin and its active metabolite are dialyzable.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child with an inadvertent ingestion of a single dose can be monitored at home if a responsible adult is present. An asymptomatic adult or adolescent with an inadvertent ingestion of 1 to 2 tablets of sitagliptin, saxigliptin and linagliptin can likely be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion or coingestion of other hypoglycemic agents should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients with hypoglycemia should be monitored until blood glucose is normal and symptoms have resolved. Patients may be discharged to home once symptoms have resolved and blood glucose or other laboratory studies are within normal limits and is cleared from a mental health standpoint. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any adult who becomes hypoglycemic and all children with more than a minor ingestion should be admitted. Patients with evidence of severe hypoglycemia or CNS effects should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in cases of severe poisonings or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated by a mental health specialist.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930755-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>SITAGLIPTIN AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: SITAGLIPTIN: Limited data. An elderly woman intentionally ingested 1700 mg of sitagliptin and was treated with intravenous glucose; hypoglycemia did not develop. Another elderly woman intentionally ingested 1800 mg and was given a regular diet; no symptoms developed. A dose of 800 mg did not cause toxic effects in healthy adults. Doses above 800 mg have not been studied. LINAGLIPTIN: Limited data. Single doses of up to 600 mg (120 times the recommended daily dose) administered to healthy subjects resulted in no adverse events. SAXAGLIPTIN: At doses of up to 400 mg daily (80 times the maximum recommended human dose) for 2 weeks, no significant adverse events occurred in healthy subjects. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: SITAGLIPTIN: 100 mg orally once daily as a monotherapy or in combination with metformin or PPAR(gamma) agonist (eg, thiazolidinediones). LINAGLIPTIN: 5 mg orally once daily in adults. SAXAGLIPTIN: The recommended dose is 2.5 to 5 mg once daily.
