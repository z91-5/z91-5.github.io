Activation of T lymphocytes involving the interaction between LFA-3 on antigen-presenting cells and CD2 on T lymphocytes plays a role in the pathophysiology of chronic plaque psoriasis. The majority of T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions are of the memory effector phenotype characterized by the presence of the CD45RO marker, express activation markers (e.g., CD25, CD69) and release inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon gamma.<\/li><li>Alefacept also causes a reduction in the subsets of CD2+ T lymphocytes (primarily CD45RO+), presumably by bridging between CD2 on target lymphocytes and immunoglobulin Fc receptors on cytotoxic cells, such as natural killer cells. Treatment with alefacept results in a reduction in circulating total CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts. CD2 is also expressed at low levels on the surface of natural killer cells and certain bone marrow B-lymphocytes. Therefore, the potential exists for alefacept to affect the activation and numbers of cells other than T lymphocytes. In clinical studies of alefacept, minor changes in the numbers of circulating cells other than T lymphocytes have been observed.<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"927697-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"927697-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Bioavailability: 63% <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"927697-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 94 mL\/kg<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"927697-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 270 h <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"927697-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intramuscular<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute with 0.6 mL of the supplied diluent only (Sterile Water for Injection, USP); do not shake, swirl vial gently to mix; dissolution should take less than 2 minutes; 0.5 mL of the resulting solution will contain 15 mg of alefacept<\/li><li>after reconstitution, solution should be used immediately or within 4 hours if stored at 2 to 8 degrees C (36 to 46 degrees F)<\/li><li>inject the full 0.5 mL of solution; rotate injection sites so that new injection sites are at least 1 inch from an old site; never inject alefacept into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, or hard<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"927697-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>improvement in amount of body surface area affected and severity of affected area (eg, redness, thickness and scaling of plaque areas) are indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>lymphocyte counts; prior to initiation of therapy, any subsequent therapy, and every 2 weeks during the 12-week course of therapy<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of new-onset or reactivation of latent infection during or after a course of therapy, particularly in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"927697-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>This drug may cause chills, myalgia, dizziness, increased cough, pharyngitis, nausea, itching, or injection site pain or inflammation.<\/li><li>Advise patient to immediately report urticaria or signs of angioedema (eg, facial edema).<\/li><li>Instruct patient to immediately report signs\/symptoms of liver injury, including persistent nausea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, easy bruising, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of infection or malignancy.<\/li><li>Instruct female patients to notify provider if they become pregnant while on therapy or within 8 weeks of therapy discontinuation.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to avoid concomitant use of other immunosuppressive agents and\/or phototherapy.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
