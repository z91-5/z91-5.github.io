Common medications in this class include carisoprodol and methocarbamol. Other medications in this class include chlorzoxazone, mephenesin, zoxazolamine, and chlorphenesin carbamate. These drugs cause their therapeutic effects through CNS depression. They have been used for recreational abuse. PHARMACOLOGY: The mechanism of action of many of these drugs is unknown. Overall, they cause generalized CNS depression, which may alter the perception of pain. The specific mechanisms of carisoprodol and methocarbamol include blockade of interneuronal activity and depression of the polysynaptic neuronal transmission in the spinal cord and reticular formation of the brain. TOXICOLOGY: Their toxicity is an extension of their pharmacology, generally causing CNS depression. EPIDEMIOLOGY: There are thousands of exposures to these drugs in the United States every year. Deaths are very uncommon. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate overdose may cause mental status depression, nystagmus, mydriasis, blurred vision, tachycardia, mild hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, lethargy, euphoria, confusion, incoordination, hallucinations, ataxia, and muscle weakness. Anticholinergic symptoms are common with some of these medications, including carisoprodol. Serotonin syndrome has been reported with carisoprodol. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe overdose may rarely cause coma, shock, respiratory depression, and seizures. Death is extremely rare. ADVERSE EFFECTS: At therapeutic dosing, one might expect drowsiness, dizziness, and headache. Carisoprodol, in postmarketing reporting and in case reports, has been associated with seizures and idiosyncratic reactions, including severe weakness, transient quadriplegia, euphoria, and temporary vision loss. Hepatotoxicity has rarely been reported following therapeutic doses of chlorzoxazone. <br\/>"},{"id":"2lb3s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS - CENTRAL ACTING <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: For mild to moderate exposures, good symptomatic and supportive care is the only necessary treatment. While decontamination may decrease the absorption of these drugs, it may not be necessary as most patients require little more than supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: For severe toxicity, administer intravenous fluids and vasopressors for hypotension, and endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for severe CNS and respiratory depression. For seizures, administer benzodiazepines initially and add propofol or phenobarbital if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is not recommended because of the risk of CNS and respiratory depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be considered in patients with large overdoses who present early and are not demonstrating CNS depression and can protect the airway. Gastric lavage is not recommended as these ingestions are rarely life-threatening.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management may be an issue after large ingestions, and these patients may require intubation for respiratory depression\/airway protection.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are indicated. Monitor patients with significant CNS depression for respiratory insufficiency and rhabdomyolysis. Qualitative or quantitative levels of these agents in the blood or urine may be obtained by certain labs but are not useful or generally available for clinical management.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: For ingestions, there is no role for dialysis, hemoperfusion, urinary alkalinization, or multiple dose activated charcoal.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with mild symptoms after small unintentional ingestions may be watched at home as long as someone else is available to obtain help should the patient deteriorate. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with intentional overdoses, who are having increasing symptoms or are not safe for home management, should be sent in to a health care facility for observation until symptoms improve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who are symptomatic after a period of observation should be admitted to the hospital. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, the patient may require an ICU admission. Criteria for discharge should be clear improvement of symptoms (eg, patient is alert and able to ambulate safely). CONSULT CRITERIA: A medical toxicologist or poison center should be consulted for patients with severe toxicity or unclear diagnosis.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"2lb3s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS - CENTRAL ACTING<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: CARISOPRODOL: ADULT: Adults have developed CNS depression after ingestions of 8.5 to 21 g, but survived with supportive care. DOSE-DEPENDENT EFFECTS: Dose-dependent effects have been reported in patients abusing carisoprodol. In most cases, ingestion of 1 to 3 tablets (each tablet 350 mg) produced a general feeling of wellbeing; ingestion of 4 to 10 tablets produced hypomania (ie, excessive cheerfulness, psychomotor excitation) and greater than 10 tablets produced confusion, disorientation and partial amnesia of events. CHILD: An ingestion of 3500 mg of carisoprodol by a 5-year-old child caused coma and then death 40 hours postingestion. A toddler developed CNS depression after ingesting 700 mg, but recovered. CHLORZOXAZONE: An adult developed severe symptoms after ingesting 10 g, but recovered. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: CARISOPRODOL: ADULT: 250 to 350 mg orally three times daily and at bedtime.
