PHARMACOLOGY: Tetrabenazine is a monoamine depletor whose exact mechanism is unknown. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive depletion of monoamines (ie dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, histamine) causes toxic effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare; no fatalities have been reported. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Acute dystonia, oculogyric crisis, nausea and vomiting, sweating, sedation, hypotension, confusion, diarrhea, hallucinations, rubor, and tremor have been reported in a limited number of exposures. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, syncope, confusion, and hallucinations may develop. ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: Drowsiness. Other events can include: orthostatic hypotension, extrapyramidal symptoms, insomnia, and nausea and vomiting. Tetrabenazine therapy may increase the risk of developing depression or suicidal thoughts and\/or behaviors. Patients with Huntington's disease may be at an increased risk, especially if receiving other dopamine antagonists.

Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility.
