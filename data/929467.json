Azelastine and bepotastine ophthalmic solutions are used to treat itching of the eyes associated with allergic conjunctivitis. PHARMACOLOGY: Azelastine and bepotastine are histamine H1-receptor antagonist. They are inhibitors of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (eg, mast cells) involved in the allergic response. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are also expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects. AZELASTINE: Since each bottle of a nasal spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride (Astelin(R)), acute overdose in adults is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse events, other than increased somnolence. In studies, adults did not experience increased incidence of serious adverse events following single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg). ADVERSE EFFECTS: AZELASTINE: NASAL: MOST COMMON: Bitter taste, nasal discomfort\/burning, headache, epistaxis, sneezing, sinusitis, and somnolence. OTHER EFFECTS: Rash, nasopharyngitis, weight gain, dry mouth, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, dryness of the nose, fatigue, cough, rhinitis, and dyspnea. AZELASTINE: OPHTHALMIC: MOST COMMON: Eye burning\/stinging, headaches, and bitter taste. OTHER EFFECTS: Asthma, conjunctivitis, dyspnea, eye pain, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, pruritus, rhinitis, and temporary blurring. BEPOTASTINE: OPHTHALMIC: Alterations in taste, eye irritation, nasopharyngitis, and headache. <br\/>"},{"id":"929467-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AZELASTINE AND RELATED AGENTS  <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Following the ingestion of greater than 3 to 5 times the therapeutic dose, patients should be observed for excessive sedation for several hours (up to 12 hours postingestion). ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous system toxicity should be admitted.
