They are also indicated for the relief of pruritus and hives in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. PHARMACOLOGY: Loratadine and desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) are long acting tricyclic histamine antagonists with selective H1-receptor histamine antagonist activity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE: ADULT: Somnolence, tachycardia, and headache have been reported in overdose (range 40 to 180 mg).  Additional symptoms have included: lethargy, syncope, urticaria, and vomiting. Sinus tachycardia (150 bpm) and respiratory alkalosis were reported in an adult following an ingestion of 300 mg; the patient recovered completely. PEDIATRIC: Extrapyramidal signs and palpitations have been reported in children following doses of greater than 10 mg. A 6-year-old child ingested 300 mg of loratadine and developed mild elevations in heart rate and blood pressure with no permanent sequelae. SEVERE: Prolonged QT interval and Torsdades de Pointes (TDP)and\/or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) have been reported after therapeutic use, and might occur after overdose. Most of thest patients had other risk factors for TDP or VT..ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Xerostomia, headache, somnolence and fatigue have been reported in adults. Children (6 to 12 years) also developed nervousness, wheezing, hyperkinesia, abdominal pain and conjunctivitis in addition to symptoms reported with adults following therapeutic use. In young children (2 to 5 years), diarrhea, epistaxis, pharyngitis, influenza-like symptoms, stomatitis, earache, fatigue, and rash were observed. RARE: Hepatotoxicity, ventricular dysrhythmias, anaphylaxis, alopecia, erythema multiforme, peripheral edema, and seizures. <br\/>"},{"id":"347800-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LORATADINE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Sinus tachycardia has been reported in overdose.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose and those who are symptomatic should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. Although a retrospective review suggested that individuals with ingestions of more than 35 mg of loratadine should be observed in a healthcare facility, 2 later published abstracts (a retrospective study and a prospective study) suggested that suspected pediatric ingestions of greater than 300 mg should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and observation.
