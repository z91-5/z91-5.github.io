Intravaginal miconazole is recommended as an agent of choice for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Miconazole 0.25%, zinc oxide 15%, and white petrolatum combination ointment is indicated for the treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis. PHARMACOLOGY: Miconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent that inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme CYP450 14-alpha-demethylase. Additionally, miconazole affects triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis and increases the amount of reactive oxygen species within the cell. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose of buccal or topical miconazole. INTRAVENOUS: Seizures have been reported following IV miconazole overdose. Cardiac and respiratory arrest have been observed after high-dose or rapid IV use.  IV formulation is not available in the US. ADVERSE EFFECTS: In general, miconazole is not highly toxic.  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dysgeusia, pruritus, contact dermatitis, and anaphylactic reactions have been reported following therapeutic use of miconazole. Buccal tablets have also caused oral discomfort, oral burning, oral pain, gingival pain, swelling, or pruritus, tongue ulceration, mouth ulceration, glossodynia, dry mouth, toothache, loss of taste, and altered taste. INTRAVENOUS: Intravenous miconazole has caused tremors, hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, hyponatremia, seizures, transient tachycardia and dysrhythmias, thrombophlebitis, thrombocytosis, microcytic normochromic anemia, phlebitis, and anemia. Intravenous formulation is no longer available in the United States. <br\/>"},{"id":"928517-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MICONAZOLE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
