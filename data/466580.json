PHARMACOLOGY: Physostigmine is a carbamate with reversible inhibition of cholinesterase activity. It effectively increases the concentration of acetylcholine at the sites of cholinergic transmission and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Physostigmine poisoning causes acetylcholine excess at muscarinic, nicotinic, and CNS sites. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive doses cause cholinergic excess, which includes bradycardia\/asystole, nausea\/vomiting, sweating, hypersalivation, bronchospasm, seizures, or pulmonary edema. Death may occur due to respiratory failure. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is uncommon and rarely severe. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, sweating, hypersalivation, and bronchospasm. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe bradycardia\/asystole, seizures, and pulmonary edema. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Diaphoresis, excessive salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, dysphoria, urinary incontinence have been reported. Bradycardia or seizures may occur if IV administration of physostigmine salicylate is too rapid. <br\/>"},{"id":"466580-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PHYSOSTIGMINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The vast majority of physostigmine overdoses require only supportive care. Treat diaphoresis and excessive salivation with supportive care. Nausea and vomiting can be treated with antiemetics. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with bradycardia or asystole should be treated with atropine (1 to 2 mg IV). There is a theoretical risk of respiratory depression that would require intubation. Bronchospasm and pulmonary edema should be treated with atropine (1 to 2 mg). The doses of atropine should be proportional to the symptoms of the patient and should be titrated to reverse bradycardia causing hypotension, bronchospasm, or pulmonary edema. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: There is no method of decontamination that is useful. HOSPITAL: There is no method of decontamination that is useful.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (respiratory depression, severe bronchospasm or bronchorrhea not responding to atropine).<\/li><li>Antidote: Atropine is the antidote for physostigmine. It is used to treat bradycardia with associated hypotension, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, or pulmonary edema. Initial dose of atropine is 1 to 2 mg IV and should be titrated to reverse these clinical effects. There is no maximum dose of atropine. Atropine infusions are generally not indicated due to the short duration of physostigmine.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Bradycardia and asystole may develop. Treat with atropine and per Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) guidelines.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Physostigmine plasma concentrations are not clinically useful or readily available. No specific lab work is needed in most patients. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with moderate to severe toxicity (seizures, bradycardia\/asystole, nausea\/vomiting, sweating, hypersalivation, bronchospasm, or pulmonary edema). Monitor oral secretions, lung sounds, and pulse oxygenation for signs of pulmonary edema.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value due to the large volume of distribution and short duration of action of physostigmine and wide availability of an antidote.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent ingestions, including children who have ingested small amounts of the ophthalmic solution, can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or children with significant ingestions should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation for 4 hours. All Symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation for 4 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent nausea and\/or vomiting, sweating, and hypersalivation should be admitted. Patients with seizures, bradycardia\/asystole, bronchospasm, or pulmonary edema should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (dysrhythmias), or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"466580-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PHYSOSTIGMINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: There is no specific toxic dose to physostigmine. In some cases, the recommended IV dose of 1 to 2 mg in adults has caused seizures and cardiac dysrhythmias, likely secondary to the underlying condition being treated.  Physostigmine may be particularly dangerous when used in the setting of a tricyclic antidepressant overdose; 2 mg of physostigmine has led to asystole and death in these patients. Adults have survived IV doses of 12 mg over 45 minutes, and ingestion of 1 gram.
