COMT, an enzyme with highest activity in the liver and kidney, is responsible for catalyzing levodopa. In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa), COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa in the brain and periphery. Because of entacapone's inhibition of COMT, concomitant administration with levodopa leads to higher plasma levels of levodopa, resulting in more dopaminergic stimulation in the brain and lessening of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Increased dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, however, also leads to increased adverse effects of levodopa, and may require dosage adjustments.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"925042-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"925042-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Bioavailability: 35%; food effects none <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"925042-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 20 L <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"925042-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: 90%; Renal: 10%, 0.2% unchanged <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"925042-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>may be taken with or without food <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"925042-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>reduction of extrapyramidal movements, rigidity, tremor, gait disturbances<\/li><li>blood pressure<\/li><li>signs and symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome upon abrupt dose reduction or withdrawal<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"925042-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 200 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Comtan<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 200 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"925042-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"925042-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>COMT INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/>USES: Tolcapone and entacapone are used with levodopa\/carbidopa to treat signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson disease. PHARMACOLOGY: Entacapone and tolcapone are selective and reversible inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). They block the COMT in peripheral tissues, thus preventing elimination of catecholamines and other hydroxylated metabolites, including levodopa. This activity results in greater and more sustained plasma levels of levodopa, leading to a more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. In a study, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness occurred in elderly volunteers after ingesting 800 mg 3 times daily of tolcapone. In studies, abdominal pain and loose stools were the most commonly reported adverse effects in patients receiving entacapone 800 mg 3 times daily for 7 days. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported following treatment with COMT inhibitors: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, anorexia, xerostomia, urine discoloration, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, dyskinesia, dystonia, akathisia, insomnia, drowsiness, headache, confusion, dizziness, hallucinations, increased sweating, rhabdomyolysis, paresthesia, dyspnea, sleep disorder, excessive dreaming, and elevated liver enzymes. Fatal liver damage has been reported following therapeutic use of tolcapone. A neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like complex has been reported in association with the abrupt dose reduction or withdrawal of these agents. <br\/>"},{"id":"925042-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>COMT INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. NOTE: Vasopressors should only be used with caution in patients with symptomatic hypotension unresponsive to fluids and supine position, as COMT inhibitors may interfere with the metabolism of agents such as dopamine and norepinephrine and cause exaggerated or prolonged response. Manage dystonic reactions with anticholinergic agents (diphenhydramine, benztropine) or benzodiazepines.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the risk of aspiration secondary to CNS depression and dyskinesias. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is alert and able to protect airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Insure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 mL to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine. NOTE: Vasopressors should only be used with caution in patients with symptomatic hypotension unresponsive to fluids and Trendelenburg position, as COMT inhibitors may interfere with the metabolism of agents such as dopamine and norepinephrine and cause exaggerated or prolonged response.<\/li><li>Drug-induced dystonia: ADULTS: Benztropine 1 to 2 mg IV or diphenhydramine 1 mg\/kg\/dose IV over 2 minutes.

Monitor input and output, serum electrolytes, CK, and renal function. Diuretics may be necessary to maintain urine output. Urinary alkalinization is NOT routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit due to the high protein binding of the COMT inhibitors.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and perform neurologic exam. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor liver enzymes after significant overdose. Monitor CK, renal function, and urine output in patients with rhabdomyolysis. Serum concentrations of COMT inhibitors are not widely available or clinically useful in managing overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
