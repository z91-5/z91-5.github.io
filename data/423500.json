The belladonna extract provides the active alkaloids atropine and scopolamine, while the opium component provides, primarily, morphine. The atropine alkaloid is parasympatholytic, exerting antispasmodic activity by relaxation of smooth muscle. Atropine activity also counteracts morphine induced smooth muscle spasm without affecting the analgesia. The morphine alkaloid of opium exerts analgesic activity by increasing the pain threshold and decreasing the sensitivity to pain. The oxidative dealkylated nor-metabolites of morphine begin the analgesic process.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"423500-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"423500-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Morphine, Liver: magnitude unspecified<\/li><li>Morphine, nor-metabolites: active<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"423500-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Morphine, Renal: changed <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"423500-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Rectal<\/b><br\/>moisten finger and suppository with water prior to insertion <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"423500-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"relief of moderate to severe pain associated with ureteral spasm and increase in intervals between opiate injections are indicative of efficacy<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"423500-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Rectal Suppository: (Belladonna Alkaloids - Opium Alkaloids) 16.2 MG-30 MG, 16.2 MG-60 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"423500-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"Drug may cause drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, photophobia, blurred vision, rapid pulse, pruritus, and urticaria. <br\/>"}}}
