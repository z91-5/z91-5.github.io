PHARMACOLOGY: Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant which is structurally related to the tricyclic antidepressants, with similar pharmacological effects. It selectively inhibits norepinephrine reuptake into the presynaptic neuron.  Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, maprotiline has little effect upon serotonin reuptake. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Effects include sinus tachycardia, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, restlessness, agitation, fever, muscle rigidity, athetoid movements, mydriasis, dry mouth, urinary retention, decreased bowel sounds, flushing, and dry skin.  SEVERE TOXICITY: Effects may include hallucinations, delirium, hypotension, respiratory failure, coma, QRS widening, ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest. Seizures can develop.  CNS depression may persist for days. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (greater than 5%): Dry mouth, constipation, nervousness, drowsiness, and dizziness, OTHER EFFECTS: Nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, and headache. RARE: Vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitation, dysrhythmias, heart block, syncope, hallucinations, restlessness, tremor, seizures, extrapyramidal symptoms, accommodation disturbances, mydriasis, urinary retention, elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral neuropathy, paralytic ileus, and myelosuppression, including agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, purpura, and thrombocytopenia. <br\/>"},{"id":"358095-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MAPROTILINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate toxicity on presentation may progress to severe toxicity over minutes to hours. For patients with mild to moderate effects on presentation, activated charcoal should be considered in patients presenting less than 2 hours postingestion. Aggressive symptomatic and supportive care includes airway protection, blood pressure support, QRS monitoring and narrowing, and seizure control. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Activated charcoal should be considered in patients presenting less than 2 hours postingestion (protect airway first). Aggressive symptomatic and supportive care is essential, including airway protection, blood pressure support, QRS monitoring, and seizure control. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Dopamine and dobutamine may not be effective. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Therapeutic doses of maprotiline may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of maprotiline and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities, overdrive pacing may be necessary. Treat QRS widening with sodium bicarbonate, treat ventricular dysrhythmias using ACLS protocols. Consider intravenous lipid therapy early for patients with ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital GI decontamination is not recommended because of the risk of seizures or CNS depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, significant CNS or respiratory depression, and hemodynamic instability.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Wide QRS complex: Treat QRS widening with sodium bicarbonate, an initial dose is 1 to 2 mEq\/kg. The goal is a serum pH of 7.45 to 7.55 and pH should be closely monitored so as not to exceed 7.6. Severe QRS widening (greater than 160 msec) not responsive to alkalinization may respond to a bolus of hypertonic saline. Consider early infusion of lipid emulsion in patients with refractory dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Ventricular dysrhythmias and QRS widening may respond to sodium bicarbonate or hypertonic sodium administration. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders (particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia). Sodium bicarbonate is generally first line therapy for ventricular dysrhythmias, administer 1 to 2 mEq\/kg, repeat as needed to maintain blood pH between 7.45 and 7.55. In patients unresponsive to bicarbonate, consider lidocaine. Cardiovert unstable ventricular dysrhythmias. Consider early infusion of lipid emulsion in patients with refractory dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Therapeutic doses of maprotiline may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of maprotiline and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, atrial overdrive pacing may be necessary.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULTS: 1 to 2 g IV (mixed in 50 to 100 mL D5W) infused over 5 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILDREN: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Rates of 100 to 120 beats\/min may terminate torsades. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Fat emulsion: Patients who develop significant cardiovascular toxicity should be treated with intravenous lipids. Administer 1.5 mL\/kg of 20% lipid emulsion over 2 to 3 minutes as an IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min. If possible, discontinue after 30 to 60 minutes. Longer periods of lipid therapy should be considered if the patient's hemodynamic stability is dependent on continued lipid infusion.<\/li><li>Seizure: Treat aggressively; acidemia may worsen cardiovascular toxicity. Initially use benzodiazepines, barbiturates. For recurrent seizures consider propofol, midazolam or pentobarbital infusion. In severe cases, neuromuscular paralysis with continuous EEG monitoring may be necessary to avoid severe acidemia and rhabdomyolysis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. Arterial blood gases and\/or pulse oximetry should be monitored in patients with respiratory or CNS depression. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic enzymes in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion of little benefit due to large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An adult with an inadvertent exposure of an extra dose, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Pediatric ingestions should be referred to a healthcare facility; severe toxicity has been reported after ingestion of 12 mg\/kg in a 6-year-old. All patients with intentional ingestions, or unintentional ingestions of unknown amounts, and all symptomatic patients should be referred to a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with worsening symptoms or severe systemic symptoms should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"358095-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MAPROTILINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Severe toxicity was reported in a child after an estimated ingestion of 12 mg\/kg.
