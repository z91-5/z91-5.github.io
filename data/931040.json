Immune checkpoint pathways downregulate T-cell activation to reduce the chance of an immune attack against normal tissues; however, cancer cells may exploit these coinhibitory pathways to resist detection or avoid elimination by the adaptive immune system. Blocking the PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling pathway allows activated tumor-specific T cells to kill tumor cells and secrete cytokines to restore antitumor immune responses.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"931040-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"3":{"id":"931040-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Total body clearance: 0.22 L\/day <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"931040-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"26 days <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"931040-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(Powder for solution) reconstitute with 2.3 mL of sterile water for injection for a final concentration of 25 mg\/mL, do not inject water directly on the powder, swirl, do not shake product, allow up to 5 minutes for bubbles to clear<\/li><li>withdraw required volume and dilute further in NS or D5W IV bag to a final concentration of 1 to 10 mg\/mL; mix solution by gentle inversion<\/li><li>store reconstituted and diluted solution for no more than 24 hours under refrigeration (2 to 8 degrees C or 36 to 46 degrees F) or no more than 6 hours at room temperature; discard any partially used vials<\/li><li>administer by IV infusion over 30 minutes through an IV line containing a sterile, nonpyrogenic, low-protein binding inline or add-on filter; do not infuse with other medications<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"931040-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>tumor response is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>changes in liver or renal function<\/li><li>changes in thyroid function; at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated<\/li><li>radiographic imaging with suspected pneumonitis<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of pneumonitis<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of colitis<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of hypophysitis<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"931040-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Keytruda<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 50 MG<\/li><li>Intravenous Solution: 25 MG\/ML<\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"931040-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Encourage patient to report symptoms of pneumonitis.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report symptoms of colitis, hypophysitis, or hepatitis.<\/li><li>Warn female patient to use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and for at least 4 months after discontinuation.<\/li><li>Side effects may include fatigue, constipation, nausea, decreased appetite, rash, pruritus, or arthralgia.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report symptoms of nephritis.<\/li><li>Tell patient to report symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
