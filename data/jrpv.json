PHARMACOLOGY: Antagonist of H2 histamine receptors. This effect decreases gastric acid secretion. TOXICOLOGY: Cimetidine inhibits the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes, 1A2, C219, and 2D6, and decreases the metabolism of many other medications. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures to H2 blockers are common, but significant toxicity has not been described. Adverse effects during therapeutic use are rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild drowsiness, dizziness or confusion. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is exceedingly rare. CNS depression and hypotension have been reported.
