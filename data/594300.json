PHARMACOLOGY: Teniposide acts at the premitotic stage of cell division to prevent cells from entering mitosis by causing dose-dependent single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA and DNA-protein cross-links. It does not intercalate into or bind strongly to DNA. It is cell phase-specific, acting in the late S or early G2 phase of cell division. TOXICOLOGY: Teniposide is a semi-synthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin. Overdose effects are likely to occur in rapidly dividing cells (ie, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Teniposide is intended for children only; limited reports of exposure. OVERDOSE: Severe myelosuppression is anticipated following overdose. Hypotension, metabolic acidosis and somnolence have been reported after 3 to 5 times the usual therapeutic dose. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Events are anticipated to be similar to adverse effects reported with therapy. Hematologic toxicity includes: myelosuppression, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Gastrointestinal effects include: mucositis, diarrhea and nausea\/vomiting. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe myelosuppression may produce bleeding and infection. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis-like symptoms may develop. ADVERSE EFFECTS: FREQUENT: Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity. Other adverse effects that may commonly occur include nausea, vomiting, mucositis and diarrhea. RARE: Hypersensitivity reactions, consisting of chills, fever, tachycardia, flushing, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and blood pressure changes (hypotension or hypertension). Transient hypotension following rapid intravenous administration have been infrequently reported in pediatric patients and may be due to the ethanol content of the formulation.<br\/>"},{"id":"594300-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>TENIPOSIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes and IV fluids as needed. Treat significant diarrhea with antidiarrheal agents. Monitor vital signs for clinically significant hypotension. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe myelosuppression (ie, neutropenia). MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MYELOSUPPRESSION: Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage.  HYPOTENSION: IV 0.9% NaCl, dopamine, norepinephrine. Central venous pressure monitoring may be indicated to guide fluid therapy. ANAPHYLAXIS: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Decontamination is not necessary in most situations as teniposide is administered intravenously. For dermal exposures, clean skin with soap and water, and for eye exposures, flush with water.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect airway or if unstable due to an infusion reaction (hypersensitivity reaction) or unstable hypotension.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours OR 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day subQ once daily. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered. <\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, olanzapine).<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Teniposide is classified as a neutral agent by one source and an irritant by another. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Administer hyaluronidase. Elevate the affected area. Apply warm packs for 15 to 20 minutes for at least 4 times daily. Administer analgesics for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable).  Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy. HYALURONIDASE: 150 Units (1 mL) given as five 0.2 mL injections into the extravasation site at the leading edge; use solution 150 Units\/1 mL vial and do not dilute further. Use a 25-gauge needle or smaller to inject subQ or intradermally into the extravasation site. Change needle after each injection.  Other sources recommend the following hyaluronidase dose: 150 to 900 Units subQ or intradermally.<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. It has not been studied in the setting of chemotherapy overdose. In patients with trastuzumab overdose, consider administering palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Monitor vital signs. Monitor renal and liver function following a significant exposure. Assess fluid and electrolyte status in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of mucositis. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unlikely that hemodialysis would be useful because teniposide is highly protein bound. Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange might be useful if performed early after large overdose, but use of these modalities has not been reported.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Intrathecal overdose with teniposide has not been reported, however, acute CNS depression has been observed in patients receiving higher than recommended doses of teniposide. After an overdose, keep the patient upright and immediately drain at least 20 mL of CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free saline). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 24 hours). Add fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP to 1 L NS or LR) or 5% albumin to the perfusate to enhance removal as teniposide is highly protein bound. Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), and daily monitoring of CBC. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with an overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"594300-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>TENIPOSIDE<\/b><br\/>TOXIC DOSE: A specific toxic dose of teniposide has not been established.
