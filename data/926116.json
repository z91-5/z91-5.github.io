PHARMACOLOGY: Antivenoms are effective based on their ability to complex an antigen with the appropriate antibody, thus neutralizing the antigen. Antivenom is produced through inoculation of the venom into an animal. Crude venom is generally poorly tolerated. Newer antivenoms are purified using multiple methods such as protein precipitation, digestion (to fragments such as Fab and Fab2) and affinity chromatography. A product can be designed to work against single venom (monovalent) or multiple venoms (polyvalent). TOXICOLOGY: The two primary risks associated with antivenom therapy are anaphylaxis and serum sickness. The likelihood of developing serum sickness is related to the amount of antivenom administered and the likelihood of developing anaphylaxis varies with the type of antivenom (intact IgG more immunogenic than Fab or Fab2 fragments). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Snake antivenoms are widely used in areas of the world with indigenous venomous snakes. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Most adverse effects from antivenom are secondary to immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Generalized urticaria, fever, itching, palpitations, nausea and vomiting can develop with an early anaphylactoid reaction. Severe anaphylaxis with bronchospasm, laryngeal edema and hypotension has occurred and can be fatal. Serum sickness can develop 5 days to 3 weeks after antivenom administration and is more common when larger amounts of antivenom are used. Clinical effects include fever, rash, myalgias, malaise, and in rare cases proteinuria and uritis. <br\/>"},{"id":"926116-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SNAKES-ANTIVENOMS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Ingestion unlikely; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild anaphylactoid reactions such as rash and urticaria often respond to further diluting the antivenom and administering it at a slower infusion rate, and administering antihistamines and corticosteroids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat anaphylaxis by immediately stopping antivenom infusion and administering antihistamines, corticosteroids and epinephrine. Endotracheal intubation and inhaled beta agonists may also be necessary. Treat bradycardia, asystole per ACLS guidelines.<\/li><li>Airway management: Early endotracheal intubation should be considered in any patient with upper airway edema or severe respiratory distress.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Antivenom plasma levels are not clinically useful nor readily available for most antivenoms. Monitor patients carefully (vital signs, skin exam, lung exam and pulse oximetry) for evidence of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction during antivenom infusion. Monitor laboratory studies as appropriate for the type of envenomation being treated.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Enhanced elimination is not useful.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: None. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients treated with snake antivenom are generally observed for recurrent symptoms. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with ongoing allergic or envenomation symptoms should be admitted to an ICU setting.
