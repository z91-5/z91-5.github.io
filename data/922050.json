The mechanism by which it exerts its effects in multiple sclerosis (MS) are not clearly understood . It is known, however, that the biologic response-modifying properties of interferon beta-1b are mediated through its interactions with specific cell receptors found on the surface of human cells . Binding of interferon beta-1b to these receptors induces the expression of a number of interferon-induced gene products (e.g., 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, protein kinase, and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase) that are believed to be the mediators of this interferon's biological actions .<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"922050-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"922050-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Bioavailability: 50%  <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"922050-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 0.25 to 2.88 L\/kg .<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"922050-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 8 min to 4.3 h .<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"922050-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Subcutaneous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute by attaching the prefilled syringe containing the diluent (sodium chloride 0.54% solution) to an intact vial, using the vial adapter<\/li><li>slowly inject 1.2 mL of diluent into vial to yield a concentration of 0.25 mg\/mL; gently swirl the vial to dissolve drug completely<\/li><li>do not shake; if foaming occurs, allow vial to sit undisturbed until foam settles<\/li><li>keeping the syringe and vial adapter in place, turn assembly over so vial is on top, and withdraw the appropriate dose into syringe<\/li><li>use reconstituted solution immediately or within 3 hours if refrigerated<\/li><li>rotate injection sites<\/li><li>missed dose: administer as soon as possible; do not give on 2 consecutive days; give next dose 48 hours later<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"922050-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>reduction in frequency of clinical exacerbations indicates efficacy in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis<\/li><li>changes in MRI studies may indicate improvement<\/li><li>CBC with differential; 1, 3, and 6 months after initiation of therapy, then periodically; frequent monitoring may be required for patients with myelosuppression<\/li><li>liver function tests and other blood chemistries; 1, 3, and 6 months after initiation of therapy, then periodically<\/li><li>thyroid function tests; every 6 months with history of thyroid dysfunction or as clinically indicated<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of liver injury<\/li><li>cardiac disease worsening; during initiation and continued treatment, in patients with preexisting congestive heart failure<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"922050-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Betaseron<\/b><br\/>Subcutaneous Powder for Solution: 0.3 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Extavia<\/b><br\/>Subcutaneous Powder for Solution: 0.3 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"922050-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"922050-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>INTERFERONS<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Data are limited.
