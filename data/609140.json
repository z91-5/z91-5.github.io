Thiamine (vitamin B-1) when given as a vitamin supplement has been used for energy metabolism and nervous system function. PHARMACOLOGY: Thiamine combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form thiamine pyrophosphate (ie, cocarboxylase), a coenzyme. Thiamine's role in carbohydrate metabolism is the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid in the blood and alpha-ketoacids to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. An increase in pyruvic acid blood concentrations indicates vitamin B1 deficiency. TOXICOLOGY: Exposure to thiamine is not anticipated to produce significant symptoms; excessive intake is usually excreted in the urine. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Thiamine is widely used; serious toxicity is not expected. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: PARENTERAL: Single parenteral doses of 100 to 500 mg have been given with no toxic effects reported. Parenteral thiamine does contain aluminum and potential toxicity may occur following excessive exposure or in patients with renal impairment. ORAL: Toxicity is uncommon following oral supplementation; excessive doses are usually excreted rapidly in the urine. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity has not been reported. ADVERSE EVENTS: PARENTERAL: Rare reports of anaphylactoid reaction (ie, respiratory distress, pruritus, shock and abdominal pain) have been reported, usually after multiple large parenteral doses of 25 to 100 mg of thiamine for more than 7 days. OTHER events have included injection site pain following intravenous administration. ORAL: Adverse events are not usually reported following oral supplementation, even following high doses of 300 mg\/day for several weeks.<br\/>"},{"id":"609140-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>THIAMINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not anticipated because of thiamine's low toxicity profile. ANAPHYLAXIS: Rare reports of anaphylaxis have occurred with parenteral thiamine administration. MILD\/MODERATE: Give antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Decontamination is not necessary because of the low risk of toxicity. HOSPITAL: Decontamination is usually not indicated unless other more toxic coingestants are suspected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is usually not necessary; aggressive airway support is necessary if anaphylaxis occurs.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Aluminum intoxication: Parenteral thiamine hydrochloride contains aluminum; prolonged or excessive doses of thiamine hydrochloride may produce toxicity in patients at risk (eg, renal failure).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine labs are not necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Monitor for clinical evidence of an anaphylactoid reaction (angioedema, urticaria, hypotension, wheezing) as necessary. Thiamine levels are not usually clinically available or useful for guiding treatment after overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Enhanced elimination is not anticipated to be effective. Thiamine is distributed in all tissues.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  Asymptomatic adults with an inadvertent ingestion of several extra doses, and asymptomatic children with an inadvertent minor ingestion can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent symptoms should be admitted to the hospital. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"609140-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>THIAMINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Limited overdose data. PARENTERAL: Single parenteral doses of 100 to 500 mg have produced no toxic effects. However, doses above 30 mg three times daily are poorly utilized. As body tissues become saturated with thiamine, it is excreted in the urine as pyrimidine. ORAL: Toxicity is uncommon; long-term supplementation of greater than 3 grams daily has been known to produce toxicity. THERAPEUTIC: BERIBERI: Adult: 10 to 20 mg IM 3 times daily for up to 2 weeks along with a multivitamin containing 5 to 10 mg thiamine daily for one month. Pediatric: 10 to 25 mg IM or IV or 10 to 50 mg\/day orally for 2 weeks, then 5 to 10 mg orally for one month. NEURITIS OF PREGNANCY (secondary to severe vomiting): 5 to 10 mg IM daily. WERNICKE-KORSAKOFF SYNDROME: Initial: 100 mg IV followed by 50 to 100 mg IM daily until patient able to tolerate a balanced diet.
