PHARMACOLOGY: Endogenous estrogens are mostly responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult female is the ovarian follicle. Estrogens bind to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues to activate pituitary secretion of gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone through negative feedback mechanisms. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Estrogens are widely used; however, overdose is rare and significant toxicity has not been reported after overdose. TOXICITY: Overdose effects include nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, dizziness, abdominal pain, drowsiness\/fatigue, and withdrawal bleeding in women. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Hypertension, edema, nausea, vomiting, migraine. LESS COMMON: Myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, anaphylaxis, cerebrovascular accident, and neoplasm.<br\/><\/li><li><b>ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES <\/b><br\/>USES: To suppress the follicle-stimulating hormone luteinizing hormone sequence from the anterior pituitary, resulting in the suppression of ovulation and production of mucus that is less acceptable to spermatozoa. PHARMACOLOGY: An oral contraceptive acts by suppression of gonadotropins. TOXICOLOGY: There are no significant toxic effects from overdose. OVERDOSE: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headaches, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea, arterial thromboembolism, hypertension, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, cerebral thrombosis.

In terms of care for chronic use, the most immediate treatment would be cessation of use and then supportive care for associated symptoms. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Acute toxicity from estrogen use is not expected, and the mainstay of treatment would be cessation of use and supportive care of symptoms.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPTIAL: Toxicity is unlikely following acute single exposure of excessive amounts. Gastric decontamination is rarely necessary. HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is rare, GI decontamination is generally not necessary.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for estrogens.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Routine lab studies are generally not necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. In self harm ingestions monitor serum electrolytes, acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations. Monitor vital signs, particularly blood pressure.
