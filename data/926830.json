Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neurohormone, and a potent vasoconstrictor with the ability to promote fibrosis, cell proliferation and tissue remodeling. The effects of which are mediated by binding to ETA and ETB receptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, suggesting a pathogenic role for ET-1 in this disease. Bosentan exerts a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ETA and ETB, with a slightly higher affinity for ETA than ETB receptors. Bosentan decreases both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance resulting in increased cardiac output without increasing heart rate.<br\/>"},{"id":"926830-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"926830-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Bioavailability: 50%; food effects none <br\/>"},{"id":"926830-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 18 L<br\/>"},{"id":"926830-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic: via CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 pathways; Active metabolite: Ro 48-5033 <br\/>"},{"id":"926830-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Biliary; Renal: &lt;3% <br\/>"},{"id":"926830-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 5 h <br\/>"}]},{"id":"926830-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>administer morning and evening with or without food <br\/>"},{"id":"926830-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>increase in exercise capacity, decrease in clinical worsening, improvement in WHO functional class<\/li><li>liver function tests; prior to initiation and monthly thereafter<\/li><li>symptoms of liver injury (nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, and lethargy)<\/li><li>pregnancy test (urine or serum); prior to initiation of therapy performed during the first 5 days of period and at least 11 days after last unprotected sexual intercourse and monthly thereafter<\/li><li>symptoms of pregnancy (delayed onset of menses)<\/li><li>hemoglobin; 1 and 3 months, then every 3 months<\/li><li>symptoms of pulmonary edema (shortness of breath, painful or difficulty breathing)<\/li><li>symptoms of worsening congestive heart failure (weight gain and increased leg edema)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926830-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Tracleer<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 62.5 MG, 125 MG<br\/>"},{"id":"926830-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"926830-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>ENDOTHELIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<\/b><br\/>USES: Endothelin receptor antagonists are used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO group I) to improve exercise ability and decrease the rate of clinical worsening (primarily evaluated in patients with NYHA class II to IV symptoms). PHARMACOLOGY: Endothelin-1, a neurohormone, is a vasoconstrictor peptide that is produced in the endothelium of blood vessels. Endothelin-1 acts on two receptors, endothelin receptor-A and endothelin receptor-B. The endothelin receptor-A primarily acts on vascular smooth muscle cells and causes vasoconstriction in both large and small blood vessels. Endothelin receptor-B is primarily found in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells of the brain, lung, kidney, and aorta and modulates vasoconstriction by producing vasodilator substances including prostacyclin and nitric oxide. TOXICOLOGY: Overdose causes excessive vasodilation and systemic hypotension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: An adolescent male experienced nausea, vomiting, hypotension, dizziness, sweating, and blurred vision after an overdose of bosentan 10 g. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: AMBRISENTAN: Peripheral edema, nasal congestion, sinusitis, flushing, palpitations, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, and constipation.
