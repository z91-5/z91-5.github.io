Morphine may be abused for euphoric effects by multiple routes (ie, injection, insufflation, smoking, ingestion). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is not common, but may be more common in patients with chronic opioid abuse or dependence, and may be life threatening. PHARMACOLOGY: Morphine binds primarily at the Mu opiate receptors at therapeutic doses. Morphine is an opiate, a group of naturally occurring compounds derived from the poppy, Papaver somniferum. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting and pinpoint pupils. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE TOXICITY: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia. Death may result from any of these complications. INTRATHECAL INJECTION: Hypotension, respiratory depression, hypertension, CNS depression, agitation, and protracted seizures have been reported after intrathecal morphine overdose. EPIDURAL OVERDOSE: Even large epidural overdoses have only caused CNS and respiratory depression.<br\/><\/li><li><b>OPIOID ANTAGONISTS, LONG ACTING <\/b><br\/>USES: Long acting opioid antagonists (methylnaltrexone, nalmefene, and naltrexone) blunt or reverse the effects of opioid medications. Their indications include reversal of life-threatening respiratory depression secondary to stimulation of opioid receptors (nalmefene), treatment of alcohol dependence (naltrexone), and reversal of opioid-induced constipation (methylnaltrexone). Naltrexone is also used to treat chronic opioid dependence once detoxification is complete. Nalmefene hydrochloride injection was discontinued from the market in 2008. PHARMACOLOGY: Long acting opioid antagonists compete and displace narcotics at opioid receptor sites. TOXICOLOGY: Secondary to its antagonists effects at opioid receptors, these drugs may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent patients. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Naltrexone is used commonly in patients with ethanol or opioid dependence to help prevent relapse. Nalmefene and methylnaltrexone are less widely used for their specific indications. Overdose with these agents is rare. OVERDOSE: Limited data available. High doses have caused tremor, hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, and agitation. High doses will precipitate opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse reactions to long acting opioid antagonists relate to their antagonistic effects to narcotics and the resulting withdrawal symptoms. They may include pain, hypertension, diaphoresis, and agitation. In neonate, withdrawal symptoms may manifest with crying and poor feeding efforts. Pulmonary edema and dysrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in association with the use of opioid antagonists to reverse narcotic effects, but it is unclear whether these complications were the result of their use. Other reported adverse effects include dose-related hepatotoxicity, eosinophilic pneumonia, injection site reactions, depression or suicidal ideation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypotension, somnolence, headache, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, anxiety, miosis, joint and muscle pain, and rhabdomyolysis.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929451-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>MORPHINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is generally not indicated because of the risk of aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence, incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed. A CONTINUOUS infusion is likely to be necessary after a controlled-release morphine ingestion. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1 to 2 hours. Morphine has a longer duration of effect, so it is necessary to observe the patient at least 4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist. Patients with seizures and myoclonus after massive intrathecal morphine overdose have required barbiturate coma with continuous EEG monitoring.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then add adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure if hypotension persists.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Massive intrathecal overdose can cause severe toxicity.  Keep the patient upright if possible (may not be useful unless overdose is recognized immediately if solution is isobaric). Immediately drain AT LEAST 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon immediately for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter). The optimal volume and duration is not known. In one case, irrigation with 900 mL of  lactated ringers over 1 hour was associated with a 97% reduction in CSF morphine concentration.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Morphine plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Obtain acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations levels in a patient with a suspected overdose. Routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of opioid toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid-naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid-naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions, adults with symptoms or ingesting more than a therapeutic dose, or any pediatric ingestion should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Observe for at least 4 hours, to ensure that peak plasma levels have been reached and there has been sufficient time for symptoms to develop. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. MODIFIED RELEASE: Patients that have ingested a controlled-release morphine preparation have the potential for delayed and prolonged effects and should be observed for at least 12 to 16 hours. The Tmax of many of these preparations is in the range of 7 to 9 hours after therapeutic doses and may be prolonged after overdose. Morphine continues to be released from these preparations adding to the systemic morphine load for up to 48 hours or longer after use. ADMISSION CRITERIA: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Patients with significant, persistent central nervous system depression should be admitted to the hospital. A patient needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as a controlled-release formulation has likely been taken; additional doses may be needed. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, and those needing a naloxone infusion or who are intubated should be admitted to an intensive care setting. MODIFIED RELEASE: Any patient developing even minor to moderate opioid effects and any patient requiring naloxone should be admitted to a monitored setting as they are at risk for more severe or prolonged symptoms. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear. Refer patients for substance abuse counseling if indicated.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>OPIOID ANTAGONISTS, LONG ACTING <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: For mild to moderate toxicity, supportive care is the mainstay of treatment. This may include benzodiazepines to treat agitation and antiemetics to treat nausea and vomiting. In addition, medical providers have used clonidine to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine to treat diarrhea. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. If hypertension develops secondary to withdrawal and agitation, benzodiazepines may be useful. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: For severe toxicity, the mainstay of treatment is supportive care. If patients develop pulmonary distress, endotracheal intubation may be required. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not indicated as toxicity is self-limited. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not indicated unless more toxic co-ingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with pulmonary distress.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring, obtain an ECG, and administer oxygen.  Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders.  Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, particularly in patients with underlying impaired cardiac function. Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the large volume of distribution of these agents.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No laboratory studies are need unless otherwise clinically indicated. Serum concentrations of these drugs are not widely available or clinically useful in guiding management. Patients who receive these agents to reverse opioid toxicity should be monitored for CNS and respiratory depression and evidence of opioid withdrawal. Monitor vital signs, mental status, CK, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Long acting opioid antagonist exposures in general should be very safe and asymptomatic patients with inadvertent exposure may remain at home. However, if it was used to reverse opioid toxicity, the patient should be brought into a healthcare facility for further evaluation or if the patients are symptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate overdose, and patients in whom these drugs were used to reverse opioid toxicity should be referred to a healthcare facility. Criteria for discharge include a patient who is asymptomatic or clearly improving after an observation period of 4 to 6 hours without treatment. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have persistent symptoms or any evidence of pulmonary edema should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: If there are any concerns, a toxicologist or a poison center can be consulted for advice regarding the use of long acting opioid antagonists. <\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929451-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>MORPHINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxicity of morphine for an individual varies with tolerance developed from habitual use.
