PHARMACOLOGY: Droxidopa, a synthetic amino acid analog which is metabolized to norepinephrine for pharmacologic effect, may increase blood pressure by causing vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries and veins. Minor, temporary increases in plasma norepinephrine levels have been observed following administration of droxidopa. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE:  Overdose data are limited. Signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are anticipated to be similar to excessive pharmacologic adverse events. During post-marketing surveillance, a patient ingested 7700 mg droxidopa and developed hypertensive crisis. The patient recovered with treatment. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse reactions following therapeutic administration, with an incidence rate greater than 5% and at least a 3% greater incidence than placebo, include headache, dizziness, nausea, and hypertension. LESS FREQUENT: Symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (ie, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, mental status changes, altered consciousness) have been reported during post-marketing surveillance with droxidopa therapy. RARE: Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, bronchial asthma) may occur due to the tartrazine component of specific droxidopa products. Exacerbation of pre-existing ischemic heart disease, dysrhythmia, and congestive heart failure may occur with administration of droxidopa.<br\/>"},{"id":"930897-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DROXIDOPA<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Nitroglycerin and phentolamine are alternatives. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, and epinephrine may be required. CAUTION: Droxidopa may cause high blood pressure. If the patient demonstrates signs and symptoms of an acute allergic reaction that requires epinephrine, monitor blood pressure closely because increased blood pressure is possible with epinephrine. Although rare, treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome with oral bromocriptine, IV benzodiazepines in conjunction with cooling and other supportive measures. Consider dantrolene in severe cases.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.

Consider dantrolene in severe cases.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. CAUTION: Droxidopa may cause high blood pressure. If the patient demonstrates signs and symptoms of an acute allergic reaction that requires epinephrine, monitor blood pressure closely because increased blood pressure is possible with epinephrine. SEVERE: Administer oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Droxidopa plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with a small inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic, can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged medically. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930897-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>DROXIDOPA<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
