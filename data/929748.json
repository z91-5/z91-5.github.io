It is also indicated as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. PHARMACOLOGY: Lurasidone acts as an antagonist at dopamine type-2 (D2) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A receptors. Lurasidone also has moderate antagonistic activity at alfa-2C and alfa-2A adrenergic receptors and is a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors. It exhibits minimal or no affinity for histamine type-1 (H1) or muscarinic type-1 (M1) receptors. TOXICOLOGY: Similar to other atypical antipsychotic agents in that it has a propensity to produce extrapyramidal effects. It does have alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist activity which may produce hypotension and other hemodynamic effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare.  MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Limited experience. During premarketing clinical trials, a patient ingested approximately 560 mg of lurasidone and recovered without sequelae. SEVERE POISONING: At the time of this review, there is no information on severe toxicity with lurasidone. Severe overdose might cause hypotension and altered mental status. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common events reported with therapeutic use include somnolence, akathisia, nausea, parkinsonism, and agitation. Infrequent but potentially serious events include hypotension, neutropenia\/leukopenia, hyperglycemia, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.<br\/>"},{"id":"929748-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LURASIDONE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Management will primarily be symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat hypotension with IV fluids and pressors (norepinephrine preferred) if needed. Manage dystonic reactions with anticholinergic agents. Treat severe neutropenia with colony stimulating factors. Although rare, treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome with benzodiazepines, bromocriptine, consider dantrolene, as well as cooling and supportive measures.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended due to the potential for somnolence or dystonic reactions and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a recent, significant overdose who is alert or in whom airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Insure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Treat hypotension with intravenous fluids. If hypotension persists, administer vasopressors. Norepinephrine is preferred; the manufacturer recommends avoidance of epinephrine and dopamine since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of lurasidone-induced alpha blockade.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor.

Lurasidone plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the treatment of overdose. Obtain a baseline ECG and repeat as needed; continuous cardiac monitoring may be necessary in symptomatic patients. Routine laboratory studies are not likely to be necessary.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating persistent neurotoxicity should be admitted.
