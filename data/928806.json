PHARMACOLOGY: Endothelin-1, a neurohormone, is a vasoconstrictor peptide that is produced in the endothelium of blood vessels. Endothelin-1 acts on two receptors, endothelin receptor-A and endothelin receptor-B. The endothelin receptor-A primarily acts on vascular smooth muscle cells and causes vasoconstriction in both large and small blood vessels. Endothelin receptor-B is primarily found in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells of the brain, lung, kidney, and aorta and modulates vasoconstriction by producing vasodilator substances including prostacyclin and nitric oxide. TOXICOLOGY: Overdose causes excessive vasodilation and systemic hypotension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: An adolescent male experienced nausea, vomiting, hypotension, dizziness, sweating, and blurred vision after an overdose of bosentan 10 g. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: AMBRISENTAN: Peripheral edema, nasal congestion, sinusitis, flushing, palpitations, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, and constipation. BOSENTAN: Respiratory tract infections, anemia.
