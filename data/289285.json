Hyaluronidase is also used for improvement in the resorption of radiocontrast media for urography if IV administration cannot be accomplished. PHARMACOLOGY: Hyaluronidase is an enzyme which hydrolyzes intercellular ground substance. It enhances absorption and diffusion of drugs injected concomitantly by decreasing viscosity and barrier action of these substances.  Hyaluronidase human recombinant is a purified preparation of the enzyme recombinant human hyaluronidase produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Hyaluronidase human recombinant is a dispersing agent which modifies connective tissue permeability through hydrolysis of hyaluronic acid. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose of hyaluronidase has not been reported. Extensions of adverse effects seen at therapeutic doses should be expected. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Purified hyaluronidase has little toxicity.  No cardiovascular, capillary, or renal effects have been reported following single large doses. Skin hypersensitivity is rare and it has low antigenicity. Nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension, dizziness, chills, urticarial reactions, local edema, and local ecchymoses may also occur during therapeutic use. Conjunctivitis, myopia, and astigmatism have occurred following subconjunctival injections of hyaluronidase. Postoperative periorbital swelling and inflammation have also been reported following periorbital injection of high concentrations of hyaluronidase. <br\/>"},{"id":"289285-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>HYALURONIDASE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Hyaluronidase is administered topically and parenterally. Hyaluronidase is a protein found in nature and is likely to be digested following an ingestion. Gastrointestinal decontamination of the topical product is generally not necessary.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Monitor airway.

SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs following significant overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting. <\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treated until symptoms resolve. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted.

Seven patients developed non-infectious periorbital inflammation 12 hours to 3 days after undergoing phacoemulsification under either a peribulbar or sub-tenon's block, including hyaluronidase (concentration range, 50 to 250 International Units\/mL) as an adjuvant to a local anesthetic agent. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: Varies by age, weight, and clinical condition of the patient; 50 to 300 units added to the injection solution. The typical dose is 150 units of hyaluronidase added to the vehicle containing the drug. CHILDREN: HYPODERMOCLYSIS: PREMATURE INFANTS OR DURING NEONATAL PERIOD: Daily dosage should not exceed 25 mL\/kg of body weight with a rate of administration no greater than 2 mL\/min. INFANTS AND CHILDREN LESS THAN 3 YEARS OF AGE: limit single clysis dose to 200 mL. UROGRAPHY (SUBCUTANEOUS): Administer 75 units SubQ over each scapula.
