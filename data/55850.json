Intramuscular bacitracin is available to treat infants with pneumonia and empyema caused by susceptible staphylococci. Bacitracin zinc is also available in combination with a variety of agents such as polymyxin B, neomycin (SEE AMINOGLYCOSIDES), and hydrocortisone (SEE CORTICOSTEROIDS). PHARMACOLOGY: Bacitracin is polypeptide antibiotic, produced by a strain of Bacillus subtilis.  It has a bactericidal activity in vitro against a variety of gram-positive organisms and a few gram-negative organisms. However, only staphylococcal infections may be treated with bacitracin. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses, and severe toxicity is not expected. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Bacitracin is used primarily topically, where it is poorly absorbed. Oral doses of up to 240,000 units per day did not produce significant gastrointestinal side effects.  Transient epigastric distress, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anal itching or burning may occur. Nausea and vomiting have also been reported with bacitracin IM injection. Although ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are possible, they are unlikely unless bacitracin is administered parenterally or as a surgical irrigating solution. Nephrotoxicity has been seen when 200,000 units has been given parenterally to humans for several days, or when the agent has been used as an irrigation solution. Bacitracin has a low sensitizing potential, but has still caused allergic contact dermatitis, eczema, and histamine wheal and flare. Several cases of anaphylaxis have been reported after the use of bacitracin ointment. Skin rash and pain at the injection site may occur with IM bacitracin. <br\/>"},{"id":"55850-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BACITRACIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Most cases of bacitracin toxicity occur through parenteral administration, or the use of bacitracin in surgical irrigating solutions. There is little absorption through intact skin, or GI tract.  Ingestions of bacitracin are rarely a problem, causing only nausea, vomiting, and other minor GI upset. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after ingestion of bacitracin. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors, and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe allergic reaction.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: Bacitracin ointments applied to broken skin may be absorbed systemically, and result in anaphylactic reactions.  Surgical wounds irrigated with bacitracin have also resulted anaphylaxis in rare cases. MILD\/MODERATE: Monitor airway. Administer antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with severe vomiting and\/or diarrhea. If bacitracin is being used parenterally, or as a surgical irrigating solution, the patient should be monitored for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.  Early stages of albuminuria and proteinuria appear to be reversible.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not recommended given the low toxicity of topical bacitracin.  The effectiveness of hemodialysis following IM bacitracin overdose is unknown.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent ingestion, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Hospital admission is rarely necessary. Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"55850-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>BACITRACIN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: PARENTERAL: Bacitracin 200,000 units given parenterally for several days has caused nephrotoxicity in humans.

ORAL: Oral bacitracin 80,000 to 100,000 units in 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days has been used to treat antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. Oral doses of up to 240,000 units caused virtually no side effects or absorption.
