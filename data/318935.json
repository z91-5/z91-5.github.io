PHARMACOLOGY: These drugs are fungistatic and may be fungicidal, depending on concentration. Imidazoles inhibit biosynthesis of ergosterol or other sterols, damaging the fungal cell membrane and altering its permeability.  As a result, loss of essential intracellular elements may occur. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose experience is limited with these agents.  Due to minimal oral absorption and limited systemic toxicity, severe toxic effects following oral overdose is not anticipated. Ingestion of even large quantities should produce only minor GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  ADVERSE EFFECTS: Allergic contact dermatitis to these agents is rare but has been reported.  Following dermal applications, pruritus, erythema, stinging, urticaria and localized edema have been reported. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequent side effects following oral administration of clotrimazole. Elevated liver enzymes have rarely been reported following the use of clotrimazole troches and sertaconazole 2% topical cream. Drowsiness and disorientation have been reported following oral clotrimazole therapy. Headache may infrequently occur following therapeutic use of these agents.<br\/><\/li><li><b>KETOCONAZOLE <\/b><br\/>USES: Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of various systemic fungal infections, including candidiasis, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, oral thrush, candiduria, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole 2% cream and shampoo are indicated for tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Ketoconazole 2% cream, gel, and foam are indicated for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. PHARMACOLOGY: Ketoconazole is a broad-spectrum imidazole antifungal agent that interferes with ergosterol synthesis, altering the permeability of the cell membrane of susceptible fungi. Ketoconazole is believed to be fungistatic at therapeutic concentrations. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Headache, fatigue, and tinnitus have occurred following acute overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects following therapeutic use have been reported: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypertension, dizziness, tinnitus, headache, confusion, myopathy, weakness, contact dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, papilledema, severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, gynecomastia, adrenal suppression, suppression of androgen synthesis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, and fatal hepatic failure.
