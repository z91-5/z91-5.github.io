PHARMACOLOGY: Oprelvekin, a recombinant human interleukin-11, is a thrombopoietic growth factor that stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and induces megakaryocyte maturation, thereby increasing the production of platelets.  TOXICOLOGY: Oprelvekin is capable of inducing plasma volume expansion with hemodilution as a result of stimulation of renal sodium reabsorption. Serious fluid retention has resulted in peripheral edema, dyspnea on exertion, pulmonary edema, capillary leak syndrome, atrial arrhythmias, and exacerbation of preexisting pleural effusions. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: No reports of overdose. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Based on limited experience, oprelvekin doses of greater than 50 mcg\/kg may increase the risk of cardiovascular effects (ie, dysrhythmias, fluid retention). ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Edema, dyspnea, tachycardia, conjunctival injection, palpitations, atrial arrhythmias and pleural effusions have been reported. Other reported effects include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, oral moniliasis, blurred vision, rhinitis, neutropenic fever, anemia, headache, dizziness, and fatigue. SERIOUS: Allergic reaction including anaphylaxis may occur. Syncope, fluid retention (ie, peripheral edema, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, capillary leak syndrome and exacerbation of preexisting pleural effusions), atrial fibrillation, fever, and pneumonia have also been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"924409-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OPRELVEKIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting.  MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Assess cardiovascular function. Monitor for fluid retention following a significant exposure; monitor fluid and electrolyte balance frequently. Evaluate and monitor airway patency and adequacy of respiration and oxygenation. Treatment may consist of diuretic therapy to manage fluid retention and an increase in plasma volume. If symptoms are severe, endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation may be indicated. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; oprelvekin is only available parenterally.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, respiratory distress, severe allergic reactions, or hemodynamic instability.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Tachyarrhythmia: Monitor ECG and consider continuous cardiac monitoring following a significant overdose. Sinus tachycardia does not generally require treatment unless hemodynamic compromise develops. Atrial fibrillation or flutter generally respond to discontinuing oprelvekin, occasionally rate control is required; a short acting agent is preferred.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Obtain an ECG following a significant overdose, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor fluid balance and electrolytes as indicated. Assess for evidence of fluid retention (eg, peripheral edema, dyspnea, pleural effusion). Obtain a chest x-ray in patient's with evidence of fluid retention to evaluate for pulmonary edema, and\/or pleural effusion. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who are symptomatic and patients with deliberate overdose should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924409-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>OPRELVEKIN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The minimum acute oral toxic dose for humans is unknown.
