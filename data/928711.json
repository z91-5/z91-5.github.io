Although the specific mechanism of action of paliperidone is unknown, its proposed therapeutic activity is antagonism of both the central dopamine Type 2 (D(2)) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT(2A)) receptors. It also has antagonistic effects on the alpha-1 adrenergic, alpha-2 adrenergic, and H1 histaminergic receptors; however, the degree of affinity is unclear. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Drowsiness\/lethargy, tachycardia, dystonia, agitation\/irritability, tremor, hypertension, hypotension, confusion, dizziness\/vertigo, and muscle rigidity have been reported following paliperidone overdose.
