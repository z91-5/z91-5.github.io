It is also rarely used as an antiperistaltic agent. PHARMACOLOGY: Methadone is a long-lasting mu-receptor agonist with pharmacological properties qualitatively similar to those of morphine. Individuals who receive subcutaneous or oral methadone daily can develop partial tolerance to the nauseant, anorectic, miotic, sedative, respiratory-depressant, and cardiovascular effects. TOXICOLOGY:  The agonist activity at mu-receptor is responsible for the physical dependency, sedation, and respiratory depression. Methadone prolongs the QT interval by interactions with cardiac potassium channels.  Most patients develop minor QTc prolongation, a small number develop QTc greater than 500 msec and are at risk for torsades de pointes. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is common with associated major effects and deaths. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, miosis (variable in children), and constipation. SEVERE TOXICITY: Coma, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, dysrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, syncope, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, cardiac arrest and death. ONSET:  May be delayed. DURATION: Prolonged, 12 hours to several days after exposure. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Sedation, constipation, tolerance and dependence. OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS: Dizziness, nausea, weakness, diaphoresis, anorexia, rash, urticaria, urinary retention, visual disturbances, headache, insomnia, constipation, bradycardia, elevated liver enzymes, palpitation, ventricular arrhythmias (reported with maintenance dose of 400 mg PO daily), type I hypersensitivity reaction. Withdrawal symptoms (restlessness, irritability, weakness, lacrimation, excessive perspiration, anxiety, depression, dilated pupils, tremors, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may occur in dependent individuals if used with opioid antagonist or agonist\/antagonist, or with rapid tapering or rapid discontinuation. Prolonged QT interval and limited cases of torsades de pointes have been reported in patients receiving methadone. <br\/>"},{"id":"7ygss12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>METHADONE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive care with continuous monitoring of airway patency is the mainstay of treatment in patients who present with mild to moderate methadone toxicity. Carefully monitor respiratory rate and end tidal CO2 to avoid unrecognized respiratory depression. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression.  Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression).  Early intubation and ventilation assistance should be performed if respiratory depression does not respond to naloxone. Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if a patient presents with circulatory collapse that does not reverse with naloxone. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines, propofol and\/or barbiturates. Monitor for QT prolongation and dysrhythmias, and follow the appropriate ACLS algorithm if needed. Consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in cases of pulmonary edema not responsive to mechanical ventilation with high PEEP.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is not recommended because of the risk of aspiration with loss of airway protection and risk of seizure. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient presents early after a large ingestion with appropriate level of consciousness, patent airway, and can drink the charcoal.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in a patient with severe methadone toxicity who presents with respiratory depression that does not reverse with naloxone. Noninvasive ventilation or endotracheal intubation may be necessary in patients who develop pulmonary edema. Consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to treat pulmonary edema refractory to standard measures.<\/li><li>Antidote: Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or via an endotracheal tube. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence (including most patients taking methadone overdoses) incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal.  Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg.  Very high doses are rarely needed.  Nebulized naloxone (2 mg naloxone in 3 mL normal saline administered via nebulizer face mask) is also effective. Continuous infusion is likely to be necessary in patients who have ingested methadone, as the duration of action of naloxone is 1 to 2 hours, compared with a duration of action of 24 hours for methadone.  The infusion should be started at a rate such that two thirds of  the dose effective for initial reversal is administered each hour, and titrated as needed. Naloxone can potentiate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients. Opioid withdrawal is not life threatening, but is extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Intravenous magnesium and overdrive pacing as indicated.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status carefully.  Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring, and capnometry if available. Obtain a 12-lead ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with moderate to severe toxicity. Monitor bedside blood glucose. Obtain a chest x-ray if aspiration or pulmonary edema is suspected. Methadone is not detected on most opioid urine drug screens.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Because of the large volume of distribution and increased protein binding, there is no role for enhanced elimination.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME MANAGEMENT: All patients with suspected methadone overdose (deliberate or inadvertent) should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All children who have ingested any amount of methadone need to be observed in an Emergency Department (ED) for at least 8 hours and considered for hospital admission. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All patients who develop CNS or respiratory depression should be admitted for observation (for at least 24 hours) even after adequate response to naloxone therapy. Patients with mild toxicity who do not require naloxone can be admitted for observation to a general ward after 8 hours of initial observation. Patients who required intubation or naloxone infusion require an intensive care unit admission. Patients should not be discharged until they have remained awake and alert for 4 to 6 hours after the naloxone infusion has been discontinued. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity, or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"7ygss12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>METHADONE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>TOXIC DOSE: There is little margin between a therapeutic methadone dose for an opioid tolerant person and a toxic dose with doses of 30 to 40 mg potentially lethal for a non-tolerant adult.

Inadvertent ingestion of methadone was found to be the most toxic of the opioids; doses as low as a single tablet can lead to death (10 mg can be potentially lethal for a 10 kg toddler).
