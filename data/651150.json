The hormone vasopressin contracts vascular smooth muscle via V1 receptors coupled to phospholipase C, which stimulate the release of vasoconstrictive calcium. Splanchnic, renal, and cutaneous circulation are also affected at therapeutic doses. Gastrointestinal smooth muscle is contracted at pressor doses. At lower concentrations, vasopressin also stimulates V2 receptors, leading to an antidiuretic effect.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"651150-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"651150-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Liver: extensive<\/li><li>Kidney: extensive<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"651150-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 6%, as unchanged drug<\/li><li>Total body clearance: 9 to 25 mL\/min\/kg<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"651150-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"10 minutes or less <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"651150-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/>vasodilatory shock: dilute in NS or D5W to a final concentration of 1 unit\/mL (100 units\/100 mL) for fluid-restricted patients or 0.1 unit\/mL (50 units\/500 mL) for non-fluid-restricted patients.<br\/>"},"10":{"id":"651150-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"increased blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock who are hypotensive despite standard therapy may indicate efficacy<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"651150-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Injection Solution: 20 U\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Novaplus Vasopressin<\/b><br\/>Injection Solution: 20 U\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Pitressin<\/b><br\/>Injection Solution: 20 U\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Vasostrict<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 20 U\/ML<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"651150-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Warn patient to report symptoms of angina, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report symptoms of water intoxication, such as drowsiness, listlessness, and headaches.<\/li><li>Side effects may include abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, tremor, sweating, urticaria, ischemia (mesenteric, skin, digital), or hyponatremia.<\/li><li>Counsel patient to take with 1 to 2 glasses of water to reduce gastric symptoms when used for diabetes insipidus, abdominal distention, or diagnostic radiography.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
