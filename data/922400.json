PHARMACOLOGY: Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic and exert their antimicrobial effects by inhibition of protein synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is relatively common. However, severe toxicity is not observed. Anaphylaxis can develop during therapeutic use in some individuals. OVERDOSE:  Severe toxicity following acute overdosage is unlikely.  MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea and vomiting are common following overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypersensitivity reactions can develop with therapy in the form of various skin rashes along with more severe reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  COMMON: Nausea and vomiting with therapeutic use. Epigastric burning and ulceration may also occur. Skin hyperpigmentation may develop. Renal dysfunction, including elevated BUN, may occur due to the antianabolic activity of tetracyclines. DEMECLOCYCLINE: A diabetes insipidus syndrome has been reported following demeclocycline. CHRONIC EFFECTS: Chronic ingestion of therapeutic doses can cause discoloration and enamel defects in the teeth of the fetus if used after the 12th week of pregnancy or in infants during the first 6 to 8 months of life. <br\/>"},{"id":"922400-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>TETRACYCLINES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tetracyclines generally have a low order of toxicity. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea, treat dehydration with IV fluids as necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor renal function following a large overdose. ANAPHYLAXIS: Mild to moderate allergic reactions may be treated with antihistamines with or without inhaled beta adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. Diphenhydramine: ADULT: 50 mg orally, IV, or IM initially, then 25 to 50 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 24 to 72 hours. CHILD: 1.25 mg\/kg orally, IV, or IM initially, then 5 mg\/kg\/day orally in 4 divided doses for 24 to 72 hours. Treatment of severe anaphylaxis also includes oxygen supplementation, aggressive airway management, epinephrine, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is unlikely, gastrointestinal decontamination is generally NOT required.  DILUTION: Tetracycline and doxycycline have been implicated in causing esophageal ulcerations when taken therapeutically with minimal amounts of fluids. Immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mL) of water or milk (not to exceed 4 ounces or 120 mL in a child). HOSPITAL: Tetracyclines are generally of a low order of toxicity. In most cases, gastrointestinal decontamination will not be required. Antacids may be useful in managing gastric irritation.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support is unlikely to be necessary following mild to moderate exposure; airway management may be necessary in patients that develop severe anaphylaxis.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific lab work (CBC, electrolyte, urinalysis) is needed unless otherwise clinically indicated following a minor exposure. Monitor renal function after very large ingestions or in patients with baseline impaired renal function. Plasma tetracycline concentrations are not clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of value with these agents because of their high degree of protein binding. Tetracycline is not dialyzable.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child taking an inadvertent 1 to 2 tablets can likely be monitored at home, or an asymptomatic adult taking an inadvertent extra dose can be safely managed at home.

Immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 milliliters) of water or milk (not to exceed 4 ounces or 120 milliliters in a child). OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Obtain a baseline CBC and renal function following a significant exposure. Patients may be discharged to home once symptoms have resolved and laboratory studies are within normal limits. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients experiencing severe or persistent anaphylactic symptoms should be admitted for further monitoring and treatment as indicated. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.
