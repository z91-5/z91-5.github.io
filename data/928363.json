PHARMACOLOGY: Ibuprofen inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme, leading to decreased prostaglandin production and decreased pain and inflammation. TOXICOLOGY: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are due to both local irritant effects and the inhibition of prostaglandins (PG), which are responsible in part for maintaining the GI mucosal barrier. Inhibition of thromboxane A2 production in platelets prolongs bleeding time and contributes to gastrointestinal bleeding. Inhibition of PGI2 and PGE2, which have vasodilatory and natriuretic activity in the kidney, can be linked to sodium and water retention and occasional acute renal failure. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is common; however, severe toxicity is very rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In general, patients are asymptomatic or have mild GI upset (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain). Mild CNS depression (drowsiness, lethargy) and headache are common (incidence up to 30%). Nystagmus, diplopia, headache, tinnitus, and transient deafness may also occur following overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: With massive overdose, seizure, coma, acute renal failure, and, very rarely, cardiopulmonary arrest may occur. Upper GI bleeding may occur after acute or chronic ingestion. Elevated liver enzymes, hypoprothrombinemia, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia (associated with renal failure), hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, dyspnea, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation have also been observed in overdose. Transient episodes of apnea have been reported in young children following large ingestions. Acute pancreatitis has been reported. ONSET: Symptoms typically occur within 4 to 6 hours of ingestion. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Gastrointestinal distress, nausea, and epigastric pain are the most common findings; upper GI bleeding may occur after acute or chronic ingestion. Angioedema, hives, itching, rash, and swelling have also been reported with therapeutic use. Fluid retention, interstitial nephritis, nephritic syndrome, and acute renal failure can develop. Hematologic effects include agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Headache, asthma exacerbation, aseptic meningitis, delirium, and anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported.<br\/><\/li><li><b>OXYCODONE  <\/b><br\/>USES: Oxycodone is primarily used for the treatment of pain. Oxycodone is commonly abused for euphoric effects by multiple routes (i.e., injection, insufflation, smoking, ingestion). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is common, particularly in patients with chronic opioid abuse, and may be life threatening. PHARMACOLOGY: Oxycodone binds at the opiate receptors. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting and pinpoint pupils. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE POISONING: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, prolonged QT, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia. Death may result from any of these complications.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928363-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>IBUPROFEN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most ibuprofen toxicity resolves with supportive care. Otherwise healthy patients with a history of ibuprofen poisoning generally require only supportive care and fluid and electrolyte replacement.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic children, adults with deliberate ingestion, and children ingesting more than 200 mg\/kg should be referred to a health care facility for observation and treatment. Most patients who have ingested significant amounts of ibuprofen will manifest symptoms within 4 to 6 hours.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is generally not indicated because of the risk of CNS depression and aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence, incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed. A CONTINUOUS infusion is likely to be necessary after a controlled-release oxycodone ingestion. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1 to 2 hours. Oxycodone has a much longer duration of effect, so it is necessary to observe the patient at least 4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then add adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure if hypotension persists.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Oxycodone plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Obtain a baseline acetaminophen and salicylate levels in a patient with a suspected overdose, as oxycodone is often present in combination products. Routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of opioid toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid-naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid-naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA:  Patients with deliberate ingestions, adults with symptoms or ingestions of more than the therapeutic dose, or a pediatric ingestion should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Monitor for at least 4 to 6 hours. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. CONTROLLED RELEASE: Patients ingesting controlled-release preparations should be observed for at least 12 hours and admitted if symptoms develop (Tmax is 4.2 to 5.1 hours at a therapeutic dose and the drug can continue to be released from the controlled release preparation for 24 to 48 hours; effects may be delayed and prolonged). ADMISSION CRITERIA: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Those with significant, persistent central nervous system depression should be admitted to the hospital. A patient needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as a controlled-release formulation has likely been taken; additional doses may be needed. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, and those needing a naloxone infusion or who are intubated should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONTROLLED RELEASE: Patients with even mild to moderate opioid effects, and those who require naloxone after ingestion of a controlled-release formulation should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.
