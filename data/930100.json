PHARMACOLOGY: Vismodegib is a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor. It binds to and inhibits Smoothened, a transmembrane protein that is involved in Hedgehog signal transduction. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose has not been reported. OVERDOSE: Toxicity following overdose has not been reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects include: muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, joint pain, vomiting, decreased appetite, and ageusia. LESS FREQUENT: Other adverse effects occurring less frequently include: hyponatremia, azotemia, hypokalemia, and amenorrhea. In postmarketing surveillance, there have been infrequent reports of hepatotoxicity including elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, or hepatocellular damage. <br\/>"},{"id":"930100-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VISMODEGIB <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Management is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Management is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea or vomiting. Significant alterations in sodium may lead to seizures; correct hyponatremia and treat seizures (eg, benzodiazepines).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely required following a minor exposure. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal for a large overdose if the ingestion is recent and the patient is not vomiting and the airway can be maintained.<\/li><li>Airway management: Insure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression or seizure activity.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hyponatremia: Evaluate for hyponatremia and associated symptoms. Patients with mild symptoms can be managed with water restriction. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms should receive 0.9% sodium chloride (rarely 3% NaCl in patients with very severe symptoms). The goal is slow correction; the serum sodium should not increase more than 2 mEq\/L\/hour in any 4-hour period or more than 15 mEq\/L per day. Rapid correction may cause central pontine myelinolysis. Monitor serum electrolytes, fluid intake and output, and urine volume and electrolytes.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes and renal function. Monitor vital signs. Toxic levels of vismodegib have not been established; routine drug plasma levels are not likely to be available. Due to the risk of embryo-fetal death or severe birth defects, a pregnancy test is recommended in women of childbearing age who have been exposed to vismodegib.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding (99% or greater). Plasmapheresis might be effective based on the small volume of distribution and high protein binding, but has not been used in overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A minor (a single dose) inadvertent dose in a patient currently being treated with vismodegib can likely be managed at home. An asymptomatic child with an inadvertent exposure (a single dose) can likely be monitored at home, if a responsible adult is present. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating persistent electrolyte imbalance should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930100-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>VISMODEGIB <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
