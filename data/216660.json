Unlike the barbiturates, etomidate reduces subcortical inhibition at the onset of hypnosis while inducing neocortical sleep. Studies in animals suggest that a part of the action of etomidate consists of a depression of the activity and reactivity of the brain stem reticular formation.<\/li><li>Etomidate does not cause significant cardiovascular or respiratory depression , but may cause a brief period of apnea . Also, it does not appear to elevate plasma histamine or cause histamine release when administered in recommended doses . The decrease in cerebral blood flow produced by etomidate is approximately the same as that produced by thiopental and methohexital ; this reduction appears to be uniform in the absence of intracranial tumors. Etomidate slightly lowers intracranial pressure and it usually causes a moderate decrease in intraocular pressure . Also, etomidate (at induction doses of 0.3 mg per kg of body weight [mg\/kg]) has been reported to reduce plasma cortisol concentrations ; this effect persists for 6 to 8 hours and appears to be unresponsive to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) .<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"216660-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"216660-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"216660-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Renal: 75% (80% as metabolite) <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"216660-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 75 min <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"216660-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>only administer intravenously<br\/><\/li><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/>inject dose over 30 to 60 seconds<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"216660-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>induction of anesthesia<\/li><li>blood pressure<\/li><li>cardiorespiratory rate<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"216660-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 2 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Amidate<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 2 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"216660-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"216660-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>ETOMIDATE<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Overdose data is limited.

ADVERSE EFFECTS: Prolonged infusion can cause prolonged suppression of endogenous cortisol and aldosterone production. The following adverse effects have been reported: Transient venous pain at injection site, transient skeletal muscle movements, usually bilateral (myoclonic, averting movements, tonic movements, eye movements), hyperventilation, hypoventilation, apnea of short duration (5 to 90 seconds with spontaneous recovery), laryngospasm, hiccup, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, anaphylactoid reaction, seizures, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and psychoses. <br\/>"},{"id":"216660-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ETOMIDATE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: There is no known antidote for overdose.
