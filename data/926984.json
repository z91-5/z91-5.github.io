EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: The extent of symptoms in human overdose is unknown. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Headache, back pain, nasopharyngitis, nausea, myalgia, diarrhea, and upper respiratory tract infection. Increases of serum transaminase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal were reported following fenofibrate therapy.
