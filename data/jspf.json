Adapalene exhibits some retinoic acid-like activity but it also has additional effects. It is thought that adapalene reduces important features of the pathology of acne vulgaris by normalizing the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells and keratinization to prevent microcomedone formation, similar to the mechanism of retinoic acid.   Unlike retinoic acid, adapalene selectively binds to some nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and does not bind to cellular receptors called cytosolic retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs) . It is hypothesized that by selectively binding to certain nuclear retinoic acid receptors and not others, adapalene enhances keratinocyte differentiation without inducing epidermal hyperplasia and severe irritation, such as is seen with retinoic acid . Also, adapalene may help reduce cell-mediated inflammation, an effect demonstrated by  in vitro studies. Adapalene decreases formation of comedones and inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions .<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jspfs8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"jspfs8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Bioavailability: low <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"jspfs8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Topical: Biliary, major route.<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"jspfs8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"17.2 +\/- 10.2 hr <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"jspfs9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Topical<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(cream, gel and lotion) apply a thin film after washing; use cream at nighttime<\/li><li>(cream, gel, and lotion) avoid eyes, lips, and mucous membranes<\/li><li>(cream, gel, and lotion) do not apply to cuts, abrasions, eczematous, or sunburned skin<\/li><li>(cream, gel, and lotion) avoid sun exposure<\/li><li>(cream, gel, and lotion) protective clothing and application of sunscreen is recommended when sun exposure can not be avoided<\/li><li>(cream, gel, and lotion) application of moisturizers may be necessary for relief of dry skin or irritation<\/li><li>(cream, gel, and lotion) if cutaneous signs and symptoms of treatment (such as erythema, scaling, and stinging\/burning) are severe, the frequency should be reduced or adapalene discontinued<\/li><li>(cream and gel) other topical preparations (sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid) should not be used prior to using topical adapalene; if the other topical preparations have been applied, it is recommended to not start therapy with topical adapalene until the effects of the other preparations have subsided<\/li><li>(lotion) other topical preparations (sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid) should not be used prior to using topical adapalene<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jspfs10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"improvement of acne vulgaris is indicative of efficacy<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"jspfs11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Topical Cream: 0.1 %<\/li><li>Topical Gel\/Jelly: 0.1 %, 0.3 %<\/li><li>Topical Lotion: 0.1 %<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Differin<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Topical Cream: 0.1 %<\/li><li>Topical Gel\/Jelly: 0.1 %, 0.3 %<\/li><li>Topical Lotion: 0.1 %<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"jspfs13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Drug causes sun-sensitivity.
