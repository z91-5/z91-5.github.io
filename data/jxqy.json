PHARMACOLOGY: Avanafil inhibits phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. Sexual stimulation is required to initiate local release of nitrous oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum. Avanafil enhances the local effect of NO, which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase and increases levels of cGMP. The increased levels of cGMP help produce smooth muscle relaxation and blood inflow in corpus cavernosum, facilitating erection of the penis. In the absence of sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 has no effect. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Toxicity following overdose has not been reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects include: back pain, flushing, headache, nasal congestion, and nasopharyngitis. LESS FREQUENT: Other adverse effects occurring less frequently include: URI, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, sinus congestion, hypertension, dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, dizziness, and rash. Adverse effects reported with the use of other PDE5 inhibitors include: sudden hearing loss, change in color vision (rarely), and loss of vision (rarely).<br\/>"},{"id":"jxqys12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AVANAFIL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor vital signs. HYPOTENSION: Monitor blood pressure, administer isotonic fluids at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. CHEST PAIN: Nitrates are CONTRAINDICATED in patients with a recent avanafil ingestion due to the possibility of a severe hypotensive reaction. Nitrates should be avoided for 24 hours (longer if on P450 inhibitors or if hepatic or renal dysfunction are present), given the risk of hypotension and exacerbation of ischemia. SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPOTENSION: Monitor blood pressure, administer isotonic fluids at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Administer norepinephrine or dopamine if hypotension persists. PRIAPISM is an emergency requiring immediate consult with a urologist.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely required following a minor exposure. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal for a large overdose if the ingestion is recent and the patient is not vomiting and the airway can be maintained.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support is unlikely to be necessary following a minor exposure; airway management may be necessary in patients that develop hemodynamic or cardiovascular instability.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Administer isotonic fluids at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine, if unresponsive to fluids.<\/li><li>Priapism: Priapism is an emergency requiring immediate consult with a urologist. At the time of this review, priapism has not been reported with avanafil but it has been reported with other PDE5 inhibitors. Clinical history should include the use of other agents (ie, antihypertensives, antidepressants, illegal agents) that may also be contributing to priapism. In a patient with ischemic priapism the corpora cavernosa are often completely rigid and the patient complains of pain, while nonischemic priapism the corpora are typically tumescent, but not completely rigid and pain is not typical. Aspirate blood from the corpus cavernosum with a fine needle. Blood gas testing of the aspirated blood may be used to distinguish ischemic (typically PO2 less than 30 mmHg, PCO2 greater than 60 mmHg, and pH less than 7.25) and nonischemic priapism. Color duplex ultrasonography may also be useful. If priapism persists after aspiration, inject a sympathomimetic. PHENYLEPHRINE: Dose: Adult: For intracavernous injection, dilute phenylephrine with normal saline for a concentration of 100 to 500 mcg\/mL and give 1 mL injections every 3 to 5 minutes for approximately 1 hour (before deciding that treatment is not successful). For children and patients with cardiovascular disease: Use lower concentrations in smaller volumes. NOTE: Treatment is less likely to be effective if done more than 48 hours after the development of priapism. Distal shunting (NOT first-line therapy) should only be considered after a trial of intracavernous injection of sympathomimetics.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor blood pressure. No specific lab work (CBC, electrolyte, urinalysis) is needed unless otherwise clinically indicated. Toxic levels of avanafil have not been established; routine drug plasma levels are not likely to be available or clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic, can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be observed with frequent monitoring of blood pressure. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent hemodynamic or cardiovascular instability should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for cases of severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Consult a urologist in cases of priapism.
