Plants and animals that contain cardiac glycosides are covered in separate managements. Cardiac glycosides are used for congestive heart failure and for ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation. PHARMACOLOGY: Cardiac glycosides inhibit the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. The increase in intracellular sodium leads to increased activity of the sodium-calcium exchanger, which elevates intracellular calcium and improves cardiac contractility. Cardiac glycosides also increase cardiac vagal tone which decreases cardiac sympathetic activity. TOXICOLOGY: The effects in overdose are an extension of the therapeutic effects. Increased intracellular calcium leads to early afterdepolarization, cardiac irritability, and dysrhythmias. Increased vagal and decreased sympathetic tones lead to bradycardia and heart block. Inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump causes hyperkalemia. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Cardiac glycoside toxicity is uncommon, but severe toxicity and deaths may occur. Most cases are due to exposure to pharmaceuticals, but occasionally patients will develop symptoms after ingestion of plant or animal products containing cardiac glycosides. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Toxicity from cardiac glycosides can be acute (from a single overdose due to accidental ingestion by a child or due to a self-harm attempt by an adult) or chronic toxicity (due to increased dosing or decreased drug clearance). The manifestations and treatment are slightly different. The most common symptoms following acute ingestion are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lethargy, and bradycardia. With chronic toxicity, patients often present with bradycardia, malaise, nausea, anorexia, delirium, and vision changes. SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with acute poisoning may develop severe bradycardia, heart block, vomiting, and shock. Hyperkalemia is a marker of severe acute toxicity and serum potassium is the best predictor of cardiac glycoside toxicity after acute overdose. Severe chronic toxicity causes ventricular dysrhythmias and varying degrees of heart block, but hyperkalemia is uncommon. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Headache, fatigue, stupor, gynecomastia, skin rash, and thrombocytopenia have been associated with chronic use.<br\/>"},{"id":"179990-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients who do not develop significant cardiac toxicity require only supportive care and monitoring. Patients with mild bradycardia and nonspecific symptoms from chronic poisoning should be monitored and rehydrated, but do not require specific therapy. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Following acute ingestion, patients with hyperkalemia (greater than 5 mEq\/L), symptomatic bradycardia, ventricular ectopy, or dysrhythmias should be treated with digoxin immune Fab. Digoxin immune Fab is also indicated for patients with chronic toxicity with ventricular ectopy or symptomatic bradycardia. If digoxin immune Fab is not available, patients can be treated with atropine or cardiac pacing for bradycardia and antidysrhythmics (lidocaine or amiodarone) for ventricular ectopy or dysrhythmias. Other treatments have been suggested. Phenytoin (100 mg to 300 mg IV bolus) and magnesium sulfate (2 g) have both been anecdotally reported to produce resolution of dysrhythmias from cardiac glycoside poisoning. Finally, cardiac pacing (at a rate that exceeds cardiac ectopy) can be used for patients who do not respond to medical management.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Emesis is not recommended for cardiac glycoside ingestion. Activated charcoal should be given to patients who can protect their airway and are not actively vomiting. HOSPITAL: Cardiac glycosides are well adsorbed by charcoal; administration of charcoal should be considered in all cases that present within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway protection is mandatory in patients with altered mental status.<\/li><li>Antidote: The antidote for cardiac glycoside poisoning is digoxin immune Fab (digoxin immune antibody fragment) which rapidly reverses the effect of cardiac glycosides. INDICATIONS: Indications for digoxin immune Fab include manifestations of severe toxicity (ventricular dysrhythmias, progressive bradyarrhythmias, 2nd or 3rd degree heart block), refractory hypotension, hyperkalemia (greater than 5 mEq\/L in acute overdose), significant risk of cardiac arrest (ingestion greater than 10 mg in an adult or greater than 4 mg in a child, serum digoxin concentration greater than 10 ng\/mL post-distribution [generally 6 hours after ingestion]), or lack of response to conventional therapy. The appropriate dose can be calculated from either the ingested dose or the steady state serum digoxin concentration. BY INGESTED DOSE: The digoxin immune Fab dose (in vials) equals the ingested dose of capsules (in mg) divided by 0.5 mg per vial OR the ingested dose of tablets (in mg) multiplied by 0.8 (for 80% bioavailability) and divided by 0.5 mg per vial. BY STEADY STATE CONCENTRATION: The digoxin immune Fab dose (in vials) equals the steady state serum digoxin concentration (in ng\/mL) multiplied by the patient weight (in kg) divided by 100. Administer 10 to 20 vials for critically ill patients or patients in cardiac arrest. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Allergic reactions are rare, but can happen, especially in patients with a history of asthma and\/or allergy to antibiotics. Hypokalemia, worsening of heart failure, and loss of ventricular rate control can also occur.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial serum digoxin concentrations and serum electrolytes every hour, until patient is improved and digoxin concentrations are clearly declining towards therapeutic. False positive digoxin concentrations have been reported in patients with pregnancy, liver disease, and hypothermia. Monitor renal function. For acute cardiac glycoside exposure, serum potassium (hyperkalemia) is the best marker of toxicity. Serum potassium should be monitored every 60 minutes following any potentially significant acute exposure to a cardiac glycoside. Serum potassium is NOT predictive of toxicity for chronic cardiac glycoside toxicity. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECG's.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis does not increase the clearance of digoxin. Multiple dose charcoal enhances digoxin clearance and may be considered in a patient who can protect their airway if digoxin immune Fab is not available.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who have only GI symptoms and a clearly decreasing serum digoxin concentration can be discharged after a minimum of 8 hours of observation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admit all patients, who develop dysrhythmias, heart block, severe vomiting, or who require digoxin immune Fab treatment, to an ICU setting. Admit patients to a monitored setting if they have digoxin concentrations that are not clearly declining during 8 hours of observation.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"179990-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES<\/b><br\/> TOXICITY: ADULTS: Healthy adults may develop symptoms after acute ingestions of more than 2 to 3 mg, but rarely develop life-threatening toxicity with acute ingestions of less than 5 mg. Ingestions causing cardiac arrest in healthy adults are generally 10 mg digoxin or more. PEDIATRIC: A healthy child can probably tolerate an acute ingestion of 2 mg digoxin without severe toxicity. Toxic effects are likely with ingestions of more than 0.1 mg\/kg, and acute ingestions of 4 mg digoxin or more in young children may be fatal. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Varies with formulation. ADULTS: (intravenous and\/or oral capsule) For rapid digitalization, give a digoxin loading dose of 0.4 to 0.6 mg orally or IV; for gradual digitalization, give digoxin maintenance doses of 0.05 to 0.350 mg orally once daily. (Tablet) 0.5 to 0.75 mg orally as a loading dose for rapid digitalization, then 0.125 to 0.5 mg orally once daily. (Solution) maintenance dose of 3 mcg\/kg orally daily. CHILDREN: (intravenous and\/or oral capsule) For rapid digitalization, give orally or IV in divided doses (premature) 15 to 25 mcg\/kg; (full-term) 20 to 30 mcg\/kg; (1 to 24 months) 30 to 50 mcg\/kg; (2 to 5 years) 25 to 35 mcg\/kg; (5 to 10 years) 15 to 30 mcg\/kg; (over 10 years) 8 to 12 mcg\/kg; for daily maintenance doses for gradual digitalization, give 20% to 30% of IV digitalizing dose for premature infants or 25% to 35% of oral or IV digitalizing dose for all other pediatric patients. (Solution) older than 2 years, maintenance dose of 10 mcg\/kg\/day orally. (Tablet) 2 to 5 years of age, 10 to 15 mcg\/kg\/day in divided doses; 5 to 10 years of age, 7 to 10 mcg\/kg\/day in divided doses; over 10 years of age, 3 to 5 mcg\/kg\/day in divided doses.<br\/>"}]},"13":{"id":"179990-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Advise patient to report symptoms of toxicity (arrhythmias, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, persistent diarrhea, confusion, weakness, blurred vision, green-yellow color disturbances, halo effect).<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report symptoms of arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, ventricular fibrillation).<\/li><li>Drug may cause nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headaches, dizziness, confusion, anxiety, or depression.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
