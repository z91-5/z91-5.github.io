It is also used as an alternative to exercise with thallium myocardial perfusion imaging to detect coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole is also available in combination with aspirin. Refer to &quot;SALICYLATES&quot; management for information on aspirin overdose. PHARMACOLOGY: Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes resulting in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine. By acting on the platelet A(2)-receptor, the increase in concentration of adenosine stimulates platelet adenylate cyclase and in turn increases the levels of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which inhibits platelet aggregation. TOXICOLOGY: Inhibition of adenosine uptake in arterial endothelial cells causes vasodilation and hypotension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses.  Dizziness, warm feeling, flushing, sweating, restlessness, weakness, dizziness, hypotension, and tachycardia may occur with overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: SEVERE TOXICITY: A woman with long-standing angina developed myocardial infarction after ingesting approximately 5 g of dipyridamole tablets. Loss of consciousness, hypotension, deep ST depression and T wave inversion, elevated PT and PTT, and respiratory arrest developed in another woman after dipyridamole overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (greater than 11%): Angina pectoris, ECG changes (mostly ST-T changes), headache, and dizziness. OTHER EFFECTS: Hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distress, diarrhea, flushing, tachycardia, hypersensitivity reactions, and dyspnea. RARE: Thrombocytopenia, seizures, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, stroke, and transient cerebral ischemia may occur.<br\/><\/li><li><b>SALICYLATES<\/b><br\/>USES: Salicylates are used primarily as an analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet agent. Found in many over-the-counter preparations in oral and topical forms. It may also be found in combination with other agents such as narcotics, barbiturates, and caffeine. Topical forms are often used as rubefacients. Also found in some essential oils in high concentrations such as oil of wintergreen. PHARMACOLOGY: Salicylates inhibit cyclooxygenase, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins, and cause platelet dysfunction. TOXICOLOGY: Salicylates stimulate the respiratory center in the brainstem, interfere with the Krebs cycle (limiting ATP production), uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (causing accumulation of pyruvic and lactic acid and heat production), and increase fatty acid metabolism (generating ketone bodies). The net result is a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Common poisoning which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: GI upset, tinnitus, tachypnea, and respiratory alkalosis. SEVERE TOXICITY: Metabolic acidosis, hyperpnea, diaphoresis, fever, altered mental status, seizures, coma, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema and death. Chronic overdoses present more insidiously and may be subtle, especially in the elderly, and may consist primarily of neurologic manifestations such as confusion, delirium, and agitation. Coagulopathy, hepatic injury, and dysrhythmias are rare complications of severe overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: GI upset and tinnitus.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"925056-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>DIPYRIDAMOLE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Dipyridamole is also available in combination with aspirin. Refer to &quot;SALICYLATES&quot; management for information on aspirin overdose. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Consider using a xanthine derivative (eg, aminophylline 50 to 240 mg) to reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole overdose. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression or persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, CNS depression, hemodynamic instability, or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea or severe overdose. Monitor serial troponin and ECG in patients with chest pain. Monitor coagulation studies in patients with severe overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dipyridamole is highly protein-bound. Hemodialysis is not expected to be of value in overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Patients should be observed for 6 hours with frequent monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. Patients with unstable vital signs and\/or life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias should be admitted to an intensive care unit. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing severe poisonings.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>SALICYLATES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: An initial salicylate level should be obtained and repeated every 1 to 2 hours until a clear peak and decline is observed. Start intravenous fluids. Concentrations greater than 30 mg\/dL and rising should be treated with urine alkalinization. The presence of a large anion gap metabolic acidosis or altered mental status indicates a more severe poisoning. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with severe poisoning should be continued on urine alkalinization; hemodialysis should be strongly considered. Relative indications for hemodialysis include: renal failure, congestive heart failure, altered mental status, seizures, evidence of cerebral edema, worsening acidosis despite adequate resuscitation, persistently rising salicylate concentrations despite adequate treatment (greater than 50 to 60 mg\/dL in a chronic poisoning or levels greater than 90 to 100 mg\/dL in an acute overdose). Patients with an altered mental status may have cerebral edema; a head CT should be obtained. Mannitol can be given for cerebral edema. Severely ill patients may require respiratory support and intubation. Maintain preintubation minute ventilation at the same high respiratory rate because once the patient's respiratory drive is removed metabolic acidosis may worsen.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination with activated charcoal can be considered for large ingestions in patients with normal mental status in whom there will be a delay to definitive healthcare, but a poison center should be consulted first. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be administered to any patient who presents within 2 hours of a significant ingestion, can adequately protect their airway, and has no alteration in mental status. Administer activated charcoal to patients with large ingestions who present after 2 hours, as salicylate absorption can be delayed and erratic. Consider the use of gastric lavage for patients that present with large ingestions within 2 hours.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who are comatose or with altered mental status may need mechanical respiratory support and orotracheal intubation. If the patient requires intubation, monitor end tidal CO2 and arterial blood gases frequently and maintain the preintubation minute ventilation to prevent severe acidosis.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain serial salicylate levels every 1 to 2 hours until concentrations have peaked and are declining; basic metabolic panel every 2 hours until clinical improvement; arterial or venous blood gas for patients undergoing urinary alkalinization or moderate\/severe toxicity. In addition, obtain CBC, liver enzymes, renal function studies, INR and PTT in patients with clinical evidence of moderate\/severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Fluid\/electrolyte balance regulation: Correct dehydration with 0.9% saline 10 to 20 mL\/kg\/hour over 1 to 2 hours until a good urine flow is obtained (at least 3 to 6 mL\/kg\/hour).  In patients in whom urinary alkalinization is being considered, initial hydration may be with 10 to 20 mL\/kg of D5W with 88 to 132 mEq of bicarbonate added.  Patients in shock may require more rapid fluid administration. Correct hypokalemia with intravenous potassium boluses and oral potassium. Monitor urine output and pH hourly.<\/li><li>Acidosis: Administer 1 to 2 mEq\/kg NaHCO3 by IV bolus and begin urinary alkalinization.  Monitor blood gases and urinary pH to guide frequency and quantity of administration. Patients with refractory acidosis, inability to maintain appropriate respiratory alkalosis, or acidemia should be treated with hemodialysis.<\/li><li>Alkaline diuresis: Urinary alkalization will increase elimination of salicylates. Place 150 mEq (3 ampules) of NaHCO3 in 1 liter of 5% dextrose to provide an isotonic solution; administer 10 to 20 mL\/kg initially as a bolus, then infuse at 2 to 3 mL\/kg\/hour. Administer 20 to 40 mEq\/L of potassium chloride as an IV infusion as needed to maintain normokalemia. Oral potassium may be administered if tolerated. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia may occur with alkalinization and hypokalemia can prevent the development of an alkaline urine. Monitor serum electrolytes (in particular potassium and calcium), serum and urinary pH frequently (every 1 to 2 hours); goal of therapy is a urine pH of 7.5 to 8.<\/li><li>Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis efficiently removes salicylate and corrects acid base and electrolyte abnormalities. Hemodialysis is recommended in patients with high serum salicylate levels (greater than 90 to 100 mg\/dL after acute overdose, to 50 to 60 mg\/dL with chronic intoxication), refractory acidosis, inability to maintain appropriate respiratory alkalosis, acidemia, evidence of CNS toxicity (i.e., seizures, mental status depression, persistent confusion, coma, and cerebral edema), progressive clinical deterioration despite appropriate fluid therapy and attempted urinary alkalinization, acute lung injury, inability to tolerate sodium bicarbonate (e.g., renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema), refractory\/profound electrolyte disturbances, or renal failure. The clinical condition of the patient is more important than the serum salicylate concentration in determining the need for hemodialysis, especially in patients with chronic toxicity or delayed presentation after acute overdose. In patients with early presentation after acute overdose, serum concentrations approaching 100 mg\/dL warrant consideration for dialysis even with mild or moderate clinical manifestations of toxicity. Administer a second dose of activated charcoal to patients with persistently rising salicylate levels despite urinary alkalinization and an initial dose of activated charcoal. Consider whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol for patients with large ingestions of enteric coated products if they are alert and able to protect the airway.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with inadvertent ingestions of less than 150 mg\/kg or 6.5 g, whichever is less, of aspirin equivalent doses can generally be observed at home with normal follow-up procedures. Consider follow-up at periodic intervals of approximately 12 hours after acute ingestion of non-enteric coated salicylate products or 24-hours for enteric-coated aspirin. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have a rising salicylate concentration, metabolic acidosis, or alterations in mental status should be admitted to an intensive care setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with intentional ingestions and those with unintentional ingestions greater than 150 mg\/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin equivalent doses, whichever is less, should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. For oil of wintergreen (98% methylsalicylate), greater than a lick or taste by children under 6 years of age or greater than 4 mL by patients 6 years of age and older requires referral to an emergency department for evaluation. Patients who have a well defined peak and decline in salicylate concentration and mild to moderate symptoms that resolve with treatment can often be treated and released from an ED observation unit. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing severe poisonings and for recommendations on determining the need for hemodialysis. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy who do not require referral to a healthcare facility for other reasons (ie ingested dose or symptoms) should be referred to an obstetrician for outpatient follow up and assessment of maternal fetal risk.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"925056-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>DIPYRIDAMOLE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: CHILDREN: Ingestion of 625 mg in a 19-month-old produced toxicity, while ingestion of 400 mg in a child weighing 30 pounds (29 mg\/kg) produced no signs of toxicity. ADULTS: Doses of up to 2000 mg\/day have been used therapeutically.  Acute ingestions of 200 to 1250 mg have produced toxicity. A woman with long-standing angina had a non-ST elevation developed myocardial infarction after ingesting approximately 5 g of dipyridamole tablets.  Loss of consciousness, hypotension, deep ST depression and T wave inversion, elevated PT and PTT, and respiratory arrest developed in a woman after ingesting 1.75 g of dipyridamole. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: ADULTS: Thallium myocardial perfusion: 0.142 mg\/kg\/min (0.57 mg\/kg total) as an IV infusion over 4 minutes prior to thallium; a total dose in excess of 60 mg will most likely not be necessary. Thrombosis prophylaxis, heart valve replacement: 75 to 100 mg orally 4 times daily as an adjunct to warfarin therapy. Stroke prevention: One capsule of extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg\/aspirin 25 mg orally twice daily. CHILDREN: Safety and effectiveness of dipyridamole have not been established in pediatric patients. Oral doses of 1 to 4.2 mg\/kg\/day have been used in children with platelet dysfunction and cardiac valve replacement.
