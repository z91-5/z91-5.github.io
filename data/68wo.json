Occasionally used as a drug of abuse for their hallucinogenic effects, primarily by adolescents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is common, but rarely severe. May occur via oral, parenteral or dermal (patches or cream) routes. PHARMACOLOGY: Antihistamines are competitive antagonists of histamine (H1 and H2) receptors. Second generation antihistamines tend to be less sedating as they do not cross the blood-brain barrier as readily as the first generation antihistamines. Decongestants are sympathomimetic agents that act as alpha agonists leading to decreased nasal congestion. TOXICOLOGY: Anticholinergic (primarily antimuscarinic) effects develop in overdose due to antagonism of central H1 receptors. Large overdoses of H1 blockers, particularly diphenhydramine, may cause sodium channel antagonism. Decongestants can lead to sympathomimetic (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia, hyperventilation, intercranial hemorrhage) symptoms. GENERAL: Severe overdose may cause hypertension, tachycardia, toxic psychosis, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, and\/or coma, and may occur as a result of either antihistamine or decongestant (sympathomimetic) toxicity. The antihistamine effects usually predominate over sympathomimetic effects in adult exposures; while either the antihistamine or sympathomimetic effects may predominate in pediatric exposures. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Somnolence, anticholinergic effects (i.e., mydriasis, flushing, fever, dry mouth, and decreased bowel sounds), tachycardia, mild hypertension, and nausea and vomiting are common after overdose. Agitation, confusion and hallucinations may develop with moderate poisoning. SEVERE POISONING: Severe effects may include agitated delirium, psychosis, seizures, coma, hypotension, QRS widening, and ventricular dysrhythmias, including torsades de pointe, but are generally only reported in adults after very large, deliberate ingestions. Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure may rarely develop in patients with prolonged agitation, coma or seizures. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: ANTIHISTAMINES: Mild sedation, dizziness, impaired coordination, and mild anticholinergic effects. Paradoxical excitation can develop in some patients. SYMPATHOMIMETICS: Hypertension, tachycardia, insomnia, anxiety, nervousness, and restlessness may occur.<br\/><\/li><li><b>ANTIHISTAMINES <\/b><br\/>USES: Antihistamines are used primarily to treat allergic reactions. Also used to treat pruritus, peripheral vertigo, and as a sleep aid. Occasionally used as a drug of abuse for their hallucinogenic effects, primarily by adolescents.

Large overdoses of H1 blockers, particularly diphenhydramine, may cause sodium channel antagonism.

ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Mild sedation, dizziness, impaired coordination, and mild anticholinergic effects. Paradoxical excitation can develop in some patients.<br\/><\/li><li><b>HYDROCODONE<\/b><br\/>USES: Hydrocodone is used for the treatment of pain, and for cough suppression. Hydrocodone may be abused for euphoric effects by multiple routes (i.e., injection, insufflation, ingestion). It is available in combination products with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and mucolytics\/expectorants. It is also available as a sustained release formulation. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is fairly common, particularly in patients with chronic opioid abuse, and may be life threatening. PHARMACOLOGY: Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic derivative of codeine, that binds at the opiate receptor. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting and pinpoint pupils. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE POISONING: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia. Death may result from any of these complications.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"68wos12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANTIHISTAMINE\/DECONGESTANT <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The majority of antihistamine overdoses require only supportive care; give activated charcoal if patient presents shortly after ingestion; sedate with benzodiazepines for agitation and delirium. Hypertension and tachycardia are generally mild and well tolerated, and do not require specific treatment. Physostigmine can be used to establish a diagnosis, it may also help avoid an invasive, costly work-up, but should only be given in a setting where intensive monitoring and resuscitation are available. It should NOT be given if there is a history or ECG (QRS widening) evidence that suggests a tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early. Gastric lavage may be of benefit, if the patient presents soon after a large ingestion; administer activated charcoal as well. GI decontamination should be performed only in patients who can protect their airway or who are intubated. Severe delirium may develop and require large doses of benzodiazepines for sedation. Seizures (may rarely progress to status epilepticus) may require aggressive use of benzodiazepines, propofol and\/or barbiturates. Monitor for QRS widening and ventricular dysrhythmias; treat with intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, titrate to blood pH 7.45 to 7.55), or lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate unsuccessful. Monitor core temperature and treat hyperthermia with aggressive benzodiazepine sedation to control agitation and external cooling. Clinical manifestations may be prolonged due to delayed absorption in the setting of an anticholinergic ileus.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures. For dermal exposure, remove patches and wash skin thoroughly. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal if recent, substantial ingestion, and patient able to protect airway. Consider gastric lavage in recent, large (greater than 1 g) ingestion, but first protect the airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (i.e., seizures, dysrhythmias, severe delirium or hyperthermia).<\/li><li>Antidote: Physostigmine is indicated to reverse the CNS effects caused by clinical or toxic dosages of agents capable of producing anticholinergic syndrome; however, long lasting reversal of anticholinergic signs and symptoms is generally not achieved because of the relatively short duration of action of physostigmine (45 to 60 minutes).  It is most often used diagnostically to distinguish anticholinergic delirium from other causes of altered mental status. CAUTION: If tricyclic antidepressants are coingested, physostigmine may precipitate seizures and dysrhythmias. DOSES: ADULT: 2 mg IV at a slow controlled rate, no more than 1 mg\/min. May repeat doses at intervals of 10 to 30 min if severe symptoms recur. For patients with prolonged anticholinergic delirium consider a continuous infusion, start at 2 mg\/hr and titrate to effect. CHILD: 0.02 mg\/kg by slow IV injection, at a rate no more than 0.5 mg\/minute. Repeat dosage at 5 to 10 minute intervals as long as the toxic effect persists and there is no sign of cholinergic effects. MAXIMUM DOSAGE: 2 mg total. NOTE: Physostigmine will not reverse symptoms of sympathomimetic overdose.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: DYSRHYTHMIAS: QRS widening or ventricular tachycardia may respond to sodium bicarbonate. A reasonable starting dose is 1 to 2 mEq\/kg bolus; repeat as needed. Endpoints include resolution of dysrhythmias, narrowing of QRS complex and blood pH 7.45 to 7.55. Use lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate is not successful.<\/li><li>Seizure: Most seizures are self-limited or respond to intravenous benzodiazepines. Patients with recurrent or recalcitrant seizures should be treated with propofol or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: HYPERTHERMIA: Control agitation with benzodiazepines, initiate aggressive external cooling measures (i.e., remove patient clothing, cover with a wet sheet or keep skin damp and direct fans at the patient's skin to enhance evaporation).<\/li><li>Delirium:  Sedate patient with benzodiazepines until the patient is sleepy. Large doses (greater than 10 mg of lorazepam) may be required.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (including temperature) and mental status. No specific lab work is needed in most patients. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with significant toxicity (i.e., agitation, delirium, seizures, coma, hypotension). Monitor creatinine phosphokinase in patients with prolonged agitation, seizures, or coma; monitor renal function and urine output in patients with rhabdomyolysis. Obtain a basic metabolic panel in patients with moderate to severe toxicity to monitor for acidosis and dehydration.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are of no value.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children (other than mild drowsiness or stimulation) with acute inadvertent ingestions may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions and symptomatic patients should be sent to a health care facility for observation for 6 to 8 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous system toxicity (i.e., hallucinations somnolence, delirium, coma) or persistent tachycardia should be admitted. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, or delirium should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (i.e., seizures, dysrhythmias, severe delirium, coma) or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>ANTIHISTAMINES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The majority of antihistamine overdoses require only supportive care; give activated charcoal if patient presents shortly after ingestion; sedate with benzodiazepines for agitation and delirium.

Seizures (may rarely progress to status epilepticus) may require aggressive use of benzodiazepines, propofol and\/or barbiturates. Monitor for QRS widening and ventricular dysrhythmias; treat with intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, titrate to blood pH 7.45 to 7.55), or lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate unsuccessful. Monitor core temperature and treat hyperthermia with aggressive benzodiazepine sedation to control agitation and external cooling. Clinical manifestations may be prolonged due to delayed absorption in the setting of an anticholinergic ileus.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures. For dermal exposure, remove patches and wash skin thoroughly. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal if recent, substantial ingestion, and patient able to protect airway. Consider gastric lavage in recent, large (greater than 1 g) ingestion, but first protect the airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (i.e., seizures, dysrhythmias, severe delirium or hyperthermia).<\/li><li>Antidote: Physostigmine is indicated to reverse the CNS effects caused by clinical or toxic dosages of agents capable of producing anticholinergic syndrome; however, long lasting reversal of anticholinergic signs and symptoms is generally not achieved because of the relatively short duration of action of physostigmine (45 to 60 minutes).  It is most often used diagnostically to distinguish anticholinergic delirium from other causes of altered mental status. CAUTION: If tricyclic antidepressants are coingested, physostigmine may precipitate seizures and dysrhythmias. DOSES: ADULT: 2 mg IV at a slow controlled rate, no more than 1 mg\/min. May repeat doses at intervals of 10 to 30 min if severe symptoms recur. For patients with prolonged anticholinergic delirium consider a continuous infusion, start at 2 mg\/hr and titrate to effect. CHILD: 0.02 mg\/kg by slow IV injection, at a rate no more than 0.5 mg\/minute. Repeat dosage at 5 to 10 minute intervals as long as the toxic effect persists and there is no sign of cholinergic effects. MAXIMUM DOSAGE: 2 mg total.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: DYSRHYTHMIAS: QRS widening or ventricular tachycardia may respond to sodium bicarbonate. A reasonable starting dose is 1 to 2 mEq\/kg bolus; repeat as needed. Endpoints include resolution of dysrhythmias, narrowing of QRS complex, and a blood pH of 7.45 to 7.55. Use lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate is not successful.<\/li><li>Seizure: Most seizures are self-limited or respond to intravenous benzodiazepines. Patients with recurrent or recalcitrant seizures should be treated with propofol or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: HYPERTHERMIA: Control agitation with benzodiazepines, initiate aggressive external cooling measures (i.e., remove patient clothing, cover with a wet sheet or keep skin damp and direct fans at the patient's skin to enhance evaporation).<\/li><li>Delirium:  Sedate patient with benzodiazepines until the patient is sleepy. Large doses (greater than 10 mg of lorazepam) may be required.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (including temperature) and mental status. No specific lab work is needed in most patients. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with significant toxicity (i.e., agitation, delirium, seizures, coma, and hypotension). Monitor creatinine phosphokinase in patients with prolonged agitation, seizures, or coma; monitor renal function and urine output in patients with rhabdomyolysis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are of no value in this setting.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children (other than mild drowsiness or stimulation) with acute inadvertent ingestions may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions and symptomatic patients should be sent to a health care facility for observation for 6 to 8 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous system toxicity (i.e., hallucinations somnolence, delirium, coma) or persistent tachycardia should be admitted. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmisas, or delirium should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (i.e., seizures, dysrhythmias, severe delirium, coma) or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>HYDROCODONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital GI decontamination is generally not indicated because of the risk of CNS depression and aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed, but may occasionally be necessary. A CONTINUOUS infusion may be necessary in patients that have ingested a large overdose or sustained release formulation. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1-2 hours. Hydrocodone has a longer duration of effect, so it is necessary to observe the patient at least 3-4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are very rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose, although there are no specific reports after hydrocodone overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Hydrocodone plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Obtain a four hour acetaminophen and salicylate levels in a patient with a suspected overdose. Other routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of hydrocodone toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose, particularly in young children or those with underlying respiratory compromise. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or who are symptomatic, or any pediatric ingestion above the therapeutic dose for age and weight should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment.  IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Observation for at least 4 hours, to ensure that peak plasma levels have been reached and there has been sufficient time for symptoms to develop. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. EXTENDED RELEASE: Observe for at least 7 to 12 hours (at therapeutic doses, Tmax for extended-release hydrocodone is 5 hours; for combination chlorpheniramine products: Tmax is 3.4 hours).  Peak concentrations are expected to be delayed after overdose, and symptoms may be delayed or prolonged. Patients who develop even moderate opioid effects or who require naloxone after ingestion of an extended-release product should be admitted. ADMISSION CRITERIA: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Patients with significant, persistent central nervous system depression should be admitted to the hospital. A patient needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as additional doses may be needed. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, and those needing a naloxone infusion or who are intubated should be admitted to an intensive care setting. EXTENDED RELEASE: Patients who develop even moderate opioid effects or who require naloxone after ingestion of an extended-release product should be admitted.
