PHARMACOLOGY: Varenicline tartrate is a partial agonist of alpha-4-beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor types. Its binding can produce agonist activity at a sub-type of the nicotinic receptor, but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Varenicline also prevents nicotine binding to alpha-4-beta-2 receptors, which prevents stimulation of the central nervous mesolimbic dopamine system (the mechanism responsible for the reinforcement and reward experience associated with smoking). OVERDOSE: Limited data. Transient tachycardia and vomiting have been reported after overdose. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects. Agitation and confusion have also been observed in a limited number of patients (adults and children) following exposure to varenicline. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea (in up to 52%), vomiting, insomnia  (in up to 35%), headache (in up to 24%), abdominal pain, abnormal dreams (in up to 15%), constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, somnolence, lethargy, and gastroesophageal reflux have been reported. Based on postmarketing experience, serious neuropsychiatric events (including depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt) have been reported in some patients following the therapeutic use of varenicline.<br\/>"},{"id":"jwh2s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VARENICLINE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Usually not necessary.

Transient tachycardia and vomiting, and mild hypertension developed in an adolescent who ingested 15 mg. Another teenager ingested 10 mg and developed agitation, vomiting, tachycardia and tachypnea; symptoms resolved completely with supportive care. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: The maximum total daily therapeutic dose is 2 mg. In clinical trials, a daily dose of 3 mg twice daily produced minimal increases in the incidence of common side effects. <br\/>"}]},{"id":"jwh2s13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Encourage patient  to report agitation, hostility, depression, suicidal ideation, or unusual changes in behavior.<\/li><li>Counsel patient to immediately report seizures.<\/li><li>Warn patient to avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination until drug effects are realized due to dizziness, somnolence, or difficulty concentrating.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report symptoms of angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke.<\/li><li>Side effects may include nausea, constipation, flatulence, vomiting, insomnia, or vivid, unusual or strange dreams.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report symptoms of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome.<\/li><li>Encourage patient to report persistent nausea.<\/li><li>Advise patient to take drug after eating and with a full glass (8 ounces) of water.<\/li><li>Tell patient to limit alcohol use.<\/li><\/ul>"}]}
