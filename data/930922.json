The Fc region of the drug binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn aids in delay of lysosomal degradation of immunoglobulins by cycling them back into circulation and increasing their plasma t(1\/2). Hemophilia B patients have a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which is an established test for the biological activity of factor IX; factor IX Fc fusion protein recombinant therapy shortens the aPTT over the effective dosing period.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"930922-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"930922-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Vss: 327 mL\/kg<\/li><li>Vss, pediatrics: 349 mL\/kg (2 to 5 years); 303 mL\/kg (6 to 11 years); 326 mL\/kg (12 to 17 years)<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"930922-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Total body clearance: 3.304 mL\/kg\/hr (50 international units\/kg); 2.65 mL\/kg\/hr (100 international units\/kg)<\/li><li>Total body clearance, pediatrics: 4.406 mL\/hr\/kg (2 to 5 years); 3.613 mL\/hr\/kg (6 to 11 years); 3.483 mL\/hr\/kg (12 to 17 years)<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"930922-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>86.52 hours<\/li><li>Pediatrics: 66.4 hours (2 to 5 years); 72.23 hours (6 to 11 years); 83.59 hours (12 to 17 years)<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"930922-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>allow vial and prefilled diluent syringe to reach room temperature before use<\/li><li>slowly add diluent provided into drug vial; swirl gently until completely dissolved; do not shake<\/li><li>after reconstitution: do not refrigerate, protect from direct sunlight, use within 3 hours<\/li><li>for IV use only; administer as IV bolus no faster than 10 mL per minute<\/li><li>do not administer in same tubing or container with other drugs<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"930922-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>plasma Factor IX activity, to determine adequate response<\/li><li>prevention or reduction of bleeding episodes indicates efficacy<\/li><li>development of neutralizing antibodies; regularly in all patients, but especially with: allergic reactions, bleeding not controlled with recommended dose, or expected Factor IX activity levels not achieved<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions; particularly early in treatment<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"930922-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Alprolix<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 1 IU<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"930922-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Side effects may include headache, oral paresthesia, dizziness, or fatigue.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report symptoms of hypersensitivity (ie, hives, wheezing, difficulty breathing, or tightening of the chest).<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report symptoms of bleeding after treatment (may indicate development of an inhibitor).<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
