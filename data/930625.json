Secnidazole and tinidazole are related compounds and are long-acting 5-nitroimidazole derivatives. These drugs have antiprotozoal and antibacterial activity and are used in the treatment of protozoal and anaerobic bacterial infections. Metronidazole and tinidazole are used for the treatment of trichomoniasis, amebic liver abscesses, intestinal amebiasis, pelvic inflammatory disease, bacterial vaginosis, giardiasis, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, as well as for perioperative prophylaxis. Secnidazole is used to treat giardiasis, intestinal amebiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis, but secnidazole is not currently available in the United States. PHARMACOLOGY: These chemicals are reduced in a process unique to anaerobic metabolism; the short-lived metabolite disrupts DNA and inhibits nucleic acid synthesis. TOXICOLOGY: Mechanism is not known. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Metronidazole is commonly prescribed. Acute toxicity is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: METRONIDAZOLE: Most patients remain asymptomatic. Dark (green\/black) urine and increased liver enzymes have been reported. TINIDAZOLE: At the time of this review, there are no reports of human overdose with tinidazole. SEVERE TOXICITY: CNS depression and seizures have been reported rarely. Dizziness, diplopia, disorientation, ataxia, and sensory neuropathy have been reported with chronic overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: METRONIDAZOLE: Characteristic adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and vertigo. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported in children receiving chronic therapy. Leukopenia has been reported in approximately 1% of patients receiving therapeutic dosing. In 2 patients, sensorineural hearing loss occurred within 48 hours of use. An expected reaction in a patient who takes metronidazole and drinks ethanol is a disulfiram-like reaction; patients taking these agents should avoid ingestion of ethanol during treatment and for 3 days after cessation of treatment. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, flushing, anxiety, confusion, vertigo, and headache may occur. In severe reactions, patients may become hypotensive. TINIDAZOLE: Overall the adverse effects reported with tinidazole are similar to those of metronidazole. In clinical studies, adverse effects were mild and self-limited with therapy.<br\/><\/li><li><b>SALICYLATES<\/b><br\/>USES: Salicylates are used primarily as an analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet agent. Found in many over-the-counter preparations in oral and topical forms. It may also be found in combination with other agents such as narcotics, barbiturates, and caffeine. Topical forms are often used as rubefacients. Also found in some essential oils in high concentrations such as oil of wintergreen. PHARMACOLOGY: Salicylates inhibit cyclooxygenase, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins, and cause platelet dysfunction. TOXICOLOGY: Salicylates stimulate the respiratory center in the brainstem, interfere with the Krebs cycle (limiting ATP production), uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (causing accumulation of pyruvic and lactic acid and heat production), and increase fatty acid metabolism (generating ketone bodies). The net result is a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Common poisoning which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: GI upset, tinnitus, tachypnea, and respiratory alkalosis. SEVERE TOXICITY: Metabolic acidosis, hyperpnea, diaphoresis, fever, altered mental status, seizures, coma, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema and death. Chronic overdoses present more insidiously and may be subtle, especially in the elderly, and may consist primarily of neurologic manifestations such as confusion, delirium, and agitation. Coagulopathy, hepatic injury, and dysrhythmias are rare complications of severe overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: GI upset and tinnitus.<br\/><\/li><li><b>TETRACYCLINES<\/b><br\/>USES: Tetracyclines are used in the treatment of a wide variety of gram-negative and gram-positive infections. PHARMACOLOGY: Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic and exert their antimicrobial effects by inhibition of protein synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is relatively common. However, severe toxicity is not observed. Anaphylaxis can develop during therapeutic use in some individuals. OVERDOSE:  Severe toxicity following acute overdosage is unlikely.  MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea and vomiting are common following overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypersensitivity reactions can develop with therapy in the form of various skin rashes along with more severe reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  COMMON: Nausea and vomiting with therapeutic use. Epigastric burning and ulceration may also occur. Skin hyperpigmentation may develop. Renal dysfunction, including elevated BUN, may occur due to the antianabolic activity of tetracyclines. DEMECLOCYCLINE: A diabetes insipidus syndrome has been reported following demeclocycline. CHRONIC EFFECTS: Chronic ingestion of therapeutic doses can cause discoloration and enamel defects in the teeth of the fetus if used after the 12th week of pregnancy or in infants during the first 6 to 8 months of life.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930625-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>METRONIDAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of CNS depression or repeated seizure activity. DISULFIRAM-LIKE REACTION: Manage hypotension with IV fluids. If hypotension persists, use direct-acting vasopressors such as epinephrine or norepinephrine. Benzodiazepines may be used for associated agitation or anxiety. Fomepizole inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing the formation of acetaldehyde, and could theoretically be useful in treating severe disulfiram-like reactions, although there is limited experience with this therapy.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Most patients remain asymptomatic; prehospital decontamination is not routinely recommended. HOSPITAL: Consider decontamination if a patient presents promptly after a large oral overdose, is not vomiting, and does not have CNS depression or seizures.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with CNS depression or seizures.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Nausea: Antiemetics may be used to control nausea.<\/li><li>Tachycardia: If the patient cannot tolerate fluids, IV fluids can be given. If anxiety from a disulfiram-like reaction is present, a benzodiazepine can be given.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: If patient is hypotensive, it is either from a disulfiram-like reaction or a co-ingestant. Secure intravenous access and put patient in supine position. Initiate treatment with IV fluids. Initiate pressors if necessary and titrate to a mean arterial pressure of at least 60 mmHg. If a pressor is needed to increase blood pressure, a direct-acting agent such as norepinephrine or epinephrine is best. Insert foley bladder catheter and monitor urine output.<\/li><li>Headache: Oral analgesics can be given if tolerated. If the patient is nauseated, IV analgesics can be given.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare and often self-limited but may be a result of CNS stimulation. Treatment includes IV benzodiazepines. If seizures persist, use propofol or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Metronidazole plasma concentrations are not clinically useful or readily available. A CBC should be obtained if leukopenia is suspected clinically. Monitor serum electrolytes and glucose, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. No specific lab work is needed in most patients but may be helpful in ruling out other causes of altered mental status or seizures if they occur. Consider head CT and lumbar puncture to rule out intracranial mass, bleeding or infection for patients with CNS manifestations. Acute toxicity has not been reported with this drug.  However, standard treatment measures may be indicated in ingestions of greater than 1 to 2 grams.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are UNLIKELY to be of value for metronidazole.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with unintentional ingestions can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation for at least 4 hours. Any patient with symptoms should be sent to a healthcare facility and observed until symptoms improve or resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant seizure activity, marked disulfiram-like reaction and\/or persistent abnormal vital signs should be admitted. Patients with seizures, severe hypotension or any other life-threatening result of toxicity should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>SALICYLATES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: An initial salicylate level should be obtained and repeated every 1 to 2 hours until a clear peak and decline is observed. Start intravenous fluids. Concentrations greater than 30 mg\/dL and rising should be treated with urine alkalinization. The presence of a large anion gap metabolic acidosis or altered mental status indicates a more severe poisoning. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with severe poisoning should be continued on urine alkalinization; hemodialysis should be strongly considered. Relative indications for hemodialysis include: renal failure, congestive heart failure, altered mental status, seizures, evidence of cerebral edema, worsening acidosis despite adequate resuscitation, persistently rising salicylate concentrations despite adequate treatment (greater than 50 to 60 mg\/dL in a chronic poisoning or levels greater than 90 to 100 mg\/dL in an acute overdose). Patients with an altered mental status may have cerebral edema; a head CT should be obtained. Mannitol can be given for cerebral edema. Severely ill patients may require respiratory support and intubation. Maintain preintubation minute ventilation at the same high respiratory rate because once the patient's respiratory drive is removed metabolic acidosis may worsen.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination with activated charcoal can be considered for large ingestions in patients with normal mental status in whom there will be a delay to definitive healthcare, but a poison center should be consulted first. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be administered to any patient who presents within 2 hours of a significant ingestion, can adequately protect their airway, and has no alteration in mental status. Administer activated charcoal to patients with large ingestions who present after 2 hours, as salicylate absorption can be delayed and erratic. Consider the use of gastric lavage for patients that present with large ingestions within 2 hours.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who are comatose or with altered mental status may need mechanical respiratory support and orotracheal intubation. If the patient requires intubation, monitor end tidal CO2 and arterial blood gases frequently and maintain the preintubation minute ventilation to prevent severe acidosis.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain serial salicylate levels every 1 to 2 hours until concentrations have peaked and are declining; basic metabolic panel every 2 hours until clinical improvement; arterial or venous blood gas for patients undergoing urinary alkalinization or moderate\/severe toxicity. In addition, obtain CBC, liver enzymes, renal function studies, INR and PTT in patients with clinical evidence of moderate\/severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Fluid\/electrolyte balance regulation: Correct dehydration with 0.9% saline 10 to 20 mL\/kg\/hour over 1 to 2 hours until a good urine flow is obtained (at least 3 to 6 mL\/kg\/hour).  In patients in whom urinary alkalinization is being considered, initial hydration may be with 10 to 20 mL\/kg of D5W with 88 to 132 mEq of bicarbonate added.  Patients in shock may require more rapid fluid administration. Correct hypokalemia with intravenous potassium boluses and oral potassium. Monitor urine output and pH hourly.<\/li><li>Acidosis: Administer 1 to 2 mEq\/kg NaHCO3 by IV bolus and begin urinary alkalinization.  Monitor blood gases and urinary pH to guide frequency and quantity of administration. Patients with refractory acidosis, inability to maintain appropriate respiratory alkalosis, or acidemia should be treated with hemodialysis.<\/li><li>Alkaline diuresis: Urinary alkalization will increase elimination of salicylates. Place 150 mEq (3 ampules) of NaHCO3 in 1 liter of 5% dextrose to provide an isotonic solution; administer 10 to 20 mL\/kg initially as a bolus, then infuse at 2 to 3 mL\/kg\/hour. Administer 20 to 40 mEq\/L of potassium chloride as an IV infusion as needed to maintain normokalemia. Oral potassium may be administered if tolerated. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia may occur with alkalinization and hypokalemia can prevent the development of an alkaline urine. Monitor serum electrolytes (in particular potassium and calcium), serum and urinary pH frequently (every 1 to 2 hours); goal of therapy is a urine pH of 7.5 to 8.<\/li><li>Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis efficiently removes salicylate and corrects acid base and electrolyte abnormalities. Hemodialysis is recommended in patients with high serum salicylate levels (greater than 90 to 100 mg\/dL after acute overdose, to 50 to 60 mg\/dL with chronic intoxication), refractory acidosis, inability to maintain appropriate respiratory alkalosis, acidemia, evidence of CNS toxicity (i.e., seizures, mental status depression, persistent confusion, coma, and cerebral edema), progressive clinical deterioration despite appropriate fluid therapy and attempted urinary alkalinization, acute lung injury, inability to tolerate sodium bicarbonate (e.g., renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema), refractory\/profound electrolyte disturbances, or renal failure. The clinical condition of the patient is more important than the serum salicylate concentration in determining the need for hemodialysis, especially in patients with chronic toxicity or delayed presentation after acute overdose. In patients with early presentation after acute overdose, serum concentrations approaching 100 mg\/dL warrant consideration for dialysis even with mild or moderate clinical manifestations of toxicity. Administer a second dose of activated charcoal to patients with persistently rising salicylate levels despite urinary alkalinization and an initial dose of activated charcoal. Consider whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol for patients with large ingestions of enteric coated products if they are alert and able to protect the airway.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with inadvertent ingestions of less than 150 mg\/kg or 6.5 g, whichever is less, of aspirin equivalent doses can generally be observed at home with normal follow-up procedures. Consider follow-up at periodic intervals of approximately 12 hours after acute ingestion of non-enteric coated salicylate products or 24-hours for enteric-coated aspirin. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have a rising salicylate concentration, metabolic acidosis, or alterations in mental status should be admitted to an intensive care setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with intentional ingestions and those with unintentional ingestions greater than 150 mg\/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin equivalent doses, whichever is less, should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. For oil of wintergreen (98% methylsalicylate), greater than a lick or taste by children under 6 years of age or greater than 4 mL by patients 6 years of age and older requires referral to an emergency department for evaluation. Patients who have a well defined peak and decline in salicylate concentration and mild to moderate symptoms that resolve with treatment can often be treated and released from an ED observation unit. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing severe poisonings and for recommendations on determining the need for hemodialysis. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy who do not require referral to a healthcare facility for other reasons (ie ingested dose or symptoms) should be referred to an obstetrician for outpatient follow up and assessment of maternal fetal risk.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>TETRACYCLINES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tetracyclines generally have a low order of toxicity. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea, treat dehydration with IV fluids as necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor renal function following a large overdose. ANAPHYLAXIS: Mild to moderate allergic reactions may be treated with antihistamines with or without inhaled beta adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. Diphenhydramine: ADULT: 50 mg orally, IV, or IM initially, then 25 to 50 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 24 to 72 hours. CHILD: 1.25 mg\/kg orally, IV, or IM initially, then 5 mg\/kg\/day orally in 4 divided doses for 24 to 72 hours. Treatment of severe anaphylaxis also includes oxygen supplementation, aggressive airway management, epinephrine, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is unlikely, gastrointestinal decontamination is generally NOT required.  DILUTION: Tetracycline and doxycycline have been implicated in causing esophageal ulcerations when taken therapeutically with minimal amounts of fluids. Immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mL) of water or milk (not to exceed 4 ounces or 120 mL in a child). HOSPITAL: Tetracyclines are generally of a low order of toxicity. In most cases, gastrointestinal decontamination will not be required. Antacids may be useful in managing gastric irritation.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support is unlikely to be necessary following mild to moderate exposure; airway management may be necessary in patients that develop severe anaphylaxis.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific lab work (CBC, electrolyte, urinalysis) is needed unless otherwise clinically indicated following a minor exposure. Monitor renal function after very large ingestions or in patients with baseline impaired renal function. Plasma tetracycline concentrations are not clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of value with these agents because of their high degree of protein binding. Tetracycline is not dialyzable.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child taking an inadvertent 1 to 2 tablets can likely be monitored at home, or an asymptomatic adult taking an inadvertent extra dose can be safely managed at home. Tetracycline and doxycycline have been implicated in causing esophageal ulcerations when taken therapeutically with minimal amounts of fluids. Immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 milliliters) of water or milk (not to exceed 4 ounces or 120 milliliters in a child). OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Obtain a baseline CBC and renal function following a significant exposure. Patients may be discharged to home once symptoms have resolved and laboratory studies are within normal limits. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients experiencing severe or persistent anaphylactic symptoms should be admitted for further monitoring and treatment as indicated. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated by a mental health specialist.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930625-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>METRONIDAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: METRONIDAZOLE: ADULTS: Single doses up to 15 g have been tolerated well.
