It is taken medically for the prevention and treatment of hypokalemia. Tablets are readily available, including sustained-release formulations. Potassium is used as a salt substitute and is often present in \"low-sodium\" foods. It is also used as a water softener, and in chemistry and manufacturing processes. PHARMACOLOGY: Potassium is the human body's main intracellular cation, with only 2% of the body's stores in the intravascular compartment. It is necessary for nerve conduction, and muscle  (including cardiac) contraction. TOXICOLOGY: Local irritation after ingestion causes GI upset. Severe hyperkalemia after large IV or oral overdoses causes muscular dysfunction including weakness, paralysis, cardiac dysrhythmias, and rarely death. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Potassium toxicity from overdose is rare but may result from intentional ingestion. Iatrogenic overdoses can occur. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, paresthesias, and muscle cramps are common. Rarely, GI bleed may occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Muscular weakness progressing to paralysis may occur. Cardiac dysrhythmias often occur with concentrations greater than 8 mEq\/L, and death from cardiac arrest with concentrations of 9 to 12 mEq\/L or higher. Characteristic ECG findings occur in the following order: peaked T waves, QRS complex blends into the T wave, PR interval prolongation, P wave is lost and ST segments depress, merging S and T waves, and finally, sine waves. The presence of the sine wave is a near terminal event, signaling that hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest are near. As serum hyperkalemia is corrected, the ECG changes resolve in reverse order. ADVERSE EFFECTS: SPECIAL SITUATIONS: Inadvertent intrathecal injection of potassium was rapidly fatal in the only case that has been reported. Potassium permanganate crystals are caustic. Potassium carbonate and hydroxide are very alkaline and have been associated with ocular injury. <br\/>"},{"id":"475890-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>POTASSIUM <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Establish IV access. Initiate ECG monitoring. Cation-binding resins (ie, kayexelate) should be given orally. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Continuous ECG monitoring should be initiated and intravenous access obtained. Treat hyperkalemia associated with ECG changes aggressively; nebulized beta agonists (eg, albuterol), intravenous sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq\/kg IV, intravenous calcium chloride (preferably through a central line) or calcium gluconate (avoid calcium salts in patients taking digoxin), intravenous insulin 10 units with 25 g D50. Note: All of these therapies shift potassium intracellularly, but do NOT increase the elimination of potassium from the body; expect rebound hyperkalemia to develop, the above therapies may need to be repeated. Administer a potassium binding resin orally (usually works over hours) and administer intravenous fluids. Diuretics may be used to increase urinary potassium elimination. In severe cases, in particular, patients with renal insufficiency or those also taking potassium sparing diuretics, hemodialysis may be warranted. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed if a patient is hemodynamically unstable.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: EMESIS: Consider inducing emesis only if a recent oral overdose and the patient is not already vomiting and can protect their airway. ACTIVATED CHARCOAL:  There is no role for activated charcoal as it does not bind potassium. HOSPITAL: If a recent large oral ingestion of potassium, consider orogastric lavage to remove pills or pill fragments. Potassium tablets may be seen on X-ray. Consider whole bowel irrigation, if the patient has overdosed (particularly extended-release) and the tablets are beyond the stomach. In adults, 2 L of polyethylene glycol solution should be given initially followed by 1.5 to 2 L\/hr until clear rectal effluent and an absence of tablets on X-ray. For children 6 to 12 years of age: Administer 1 L\/hr of polyethylene glycol solution; children 9 months to less than 6 years: 500 cc\/hr should be administered. Patients must be awake and cooperative and\/or must have a protected airway for decontamination.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe intoxication (ie, cardiovascular collapse).<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote for potassium.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serial serum potassium concentrations. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function and blood glucose concentrations. Obtain serial ECGs and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Routine monitoring of electrolytes, renal function, and glucose levels may be helpful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis may be necessary in renal failure patients with hyperkalemia or in patients with normal renal function that have severe toxicity.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Intrathecal injection of potassium caused cerebral edema and was rapidly fatal in the only case reported. The following recommendations are derived from experience with other agents. Keep the patient upright and immediately drain at least 20 mL of CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CS exchange (remove seral 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free saline). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through a ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 24 hours). Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Any child who ingests more than a therapeutic dose of potassium or any intentional\/suicidal ingestion by an adult should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions and symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation for at least 4 hours. A longer observation, up to 24 hours (until serum potassium has clearly peaked and is declining without active intervention) should be considered for patients that overdose on sustained-release products. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent GI symptoms, ECG changes, or persistent hyperkalemia should be admitted to the hospital. Patients with dysrhythmias or cardiovascular collapse or those needing dialysis should be admitted to an intensive care unit. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (severe weakness or cardiac dysrhythmias), or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"475890-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>POTASSIUM <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULT: Doses as low as 2 to 2.5 mEq\/kg of potassium have been reported to cause toxicity.
