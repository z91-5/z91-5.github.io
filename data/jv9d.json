It can occur after poisoning from many pharmaceuticals and from naturally occurring alkaloids found in many plants.  These medications are commonly used as sleep aids, antispasmodics (gastrointestinal and urinary), antihistamines, and ophthalmic cycloplegics and to treat Parkinson disease.  This class of drugs is occasionally abused (mostly by adolescents) for its hallucinogenic effects. PHARMACOLOGY: Competitive antagonist of M1 and M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor. Toxic effects from antagonism of the nicotinic cholinergic system is not a component of the syndrome. In general, the desired pharmacologic effects occur when only the peripheral muscarinic receptors are antagonized and there are no central antimuscarinic effects. TOXICOLOGY: Is an extension of the pharmacologic effects, which is due to extensive antagonism of the central and peripheral muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is common but rarely severe. Toxicity may occur via oral, parenteral, or dermal route.  Systemic anticholinergic effects  have occasionally developed after use of ophthalmic preparations, mostly in young children. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Somnolence, anticholinergic effects  of mydriasis, flushing, fever, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, and tachycardia are characteristic.  Mild hypertension, nausea, and vomiting are  also common after overdose.  Agitation, confusion, and hallucinations may develop with moderate poisoning. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe effects may include agitated delirium, psychosis, hallucinations, seizures, hyperthermia, and coma. Some drugs that cause the anticholinergic toxidrome (eg, diphenhydramine) may cause QRS widening and ventricular dysrhythmias due to sodium channel antagonism, but this is not due to the anticholinergic effects. Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure may rarely develop in patients with prolonged agitation, coma, or seizures. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation are commonly seen.<br\/><\/li><li><b>INORGANIC PHOSPHATES <\/b><br\/>USES: Inorganic phosphates are used for repletion of electrolytes. Potassium phosphate\/sodium phosphate, monobasic and dibasic is indicated in adults and children over 4 years of age to increase urinary phosphate and pyrophosphate. Sodium phosphate dibasic\/sodium phosphate monobasic is indicated to prevent or correct hypophosphatemia. It is also used for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy and the relief of occasional constipation. PHARMACOLOGY: Phosphate (PO4-) is a cation that is important for many cellular functions. It is also major buffer in blood. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive phosphate in serum binds calcium and magnesium; profound hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and hypernatremia may develop. These products are hypertonic and can cause significant fluid and electrolyte shifts. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are uncommon but several deaths have been reported. Toxicology has been reported after both ingestion and rectal administration. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Asymptomatic hyperphosphatemia may also occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, altered mental status, weakness, dehydration, hypernatremia, and hypotension may develop. Profound hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia can cause tetany, seizures, bradycardia, prolonged QT interval, ventricular dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common after oral administration.<br\/><\/li><li><b>METHENAMINE <\/b><br\/>USES: Methenamine is a urinary antibacterial agent. Methenamine hippurate is used for the prophylaxis or suppressive treatment of frequently recurring urinary tract infections when long-term therapy is needed. Methenamine mandelate is used for the suppression or elimination of bacteriuria associated with pyelonephritis, cystitis, and other chronic urinary tract infections. INDUSTRIAL: The manufacture of phenolic resins is the major industrial use of methenamine. It is also used in the rubber industry to prevent vulcanized rubber from blocking and as an accelerator; in adhesives, coatings, and sealing compounds; as a dye fixative; in fire logs and briquettes for camping; and as an antimicrobial food additive. PHARMACOLOGY: Methenamine exhibits antibacterial activity by the conversion of methenamine to formaldehyde in the presence of acidic urine. The hippuric acid component also has some antibacterial activity and acts to keep the urine acidic. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose reports in the literature are limited. Gastrointestinal upset may occur following overdoses of either salt form of methenamine. Dysuria, bladder irritation, painful and frequent micturition, albuminuria, and gross hematuria have been reported following large doses of methenamine (8 g daily for 3 to 4 weeks). An overdose in a child resulted in hemorrhagic cystitis, mild metabolic acidosis, elevated BUN, and lower urinary tract irritation. Methenamine in industrial settings, is an irritant to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. When heated to decomposition, it emits toxic fumes of formaldehyde and oxides of nitrogen. It is combustible when exposed to heat or flame. Rash and skin inflammation have been reported following occupational exposures. Blisters with oozing have been reported in more severe cases. Eye and mucous membrane irritation has been reported following industrial exposures to vapors or dust. Industrial exposure to vapors may result in asthma-like reactions in previously sensitized individuals. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects following therapeutic use appear to be mild, reversible, and occur infrequently. Most common effects reported are gastrointestinal intolerance (eg, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). Rash, crystalluria, increased liver enzymes, and hypersensitivity reactions may also occur after therapeutic use.<br\/><\/li><li><b>METHYLENE BLUE <\/b><br\/>USES: Methylene blue is used to treat drug-induced methemoglobinemia and ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy. It has also been used as a mild urinary antiseptic agent, a diagnostic agent, and indicator dye. PHARMACOLOGY: Methylene blue, in low concentrations, acts as a cofactor to accelerate the conversion of methemoglobin to hemoglobin in erythrocytes. In high concentrations, methylene blue oxidizes the ferrous iron of hemoglobin to the ferric state, facilitating the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Large doses of methylene blue may result in nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, headache, dizziness, confusion, profuse sweating, and methemoglobinemia.  Necrosis, ulceration, and abscess formation may develop if injected subcutaneously.  Hypotension, tachycardia, and cyanosis occurred in a 4-year-old boy following a 1 g IV dose of methylene blue during surgery. A woman who inadvertently received anterior capsule staining with methylene blue 1% instead of trypan blue 0.025% during a cataract surgery, developed iris discoloration and stromal corneal edema with severe visual loss on the first postoperative day. INTRATHECAL INJECTION: Initial vomiting, shock, and collapse followed by paraplegia, radiculopathy, cauda equine syndrome, cranial nerve dysfunction, encephalopathy, optic neuritis and meningeal irritation have been reported after intrathecal injection of methylene blue. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, abdominal and precordial pain, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, profuse sweating, mental confusion, hypertension, dysrhythmias, and methemoglobin formation may occur following large intravenous methylene blue doses. Skin discoloration, burning sensation of the mouth and oropharynx, painful micturition, blue discoloration of the conjunctiva, persistent upper and lower lid swelling, amblyopia, nystagmus, dysrhythmias, hypotension, and hypertension have also been reported following the use of methylene blue. Methemoglobinemia has been reported following oral, intravenous, cervical administration, intraamniotic injection, and intraperitoneal administration in adults and neonates. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia include cyanosis, headache, lethargy, dizziness, fatigue, syncope, dyspnea, CNS depression, seizures, dysrhythmia, and shock. HIGH RISK GROUPS: Patients with underlying conditions such as COPD, anemia, or coronary artery disease are more susceptible to the development of symptoms. Delayed hemolysis may be noted in patients with G-6-PD deficiency. DRUG INTERACTION: Methylene blue has MAOI activity. Concomitant use of methylene blue with serotonergic drugs, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), triptans, and ergot alkaloids may increase the risk of potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. PREGNANCY: Methylene blue is classified as pregnancy category X.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jv9ds12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANTICHOLINERGIC POISONING <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The vast majority of pharmaceutical  overdoses that produce the anticholinergic toxidrome requires only supportive care; administer activated charcoal if the patient presents shortly after ingestion; sedate patients with benzodiazepines for agitation and delirium. Hypertension and tachycardia are generally mild and well tolerated, and do not require specific treatment. Physostigmine can be used to establish a diagnosis; it may help avoid an invasive, costly work-up, but should only be given in a setting where intensive monitoring and resuscitation is possible, and should NOT be given if the history or ECG (QRS widening) suggests tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early. May benefit from gastric lavage if patient presents soon after a large ingestion; administer activated charcoal. GI decontamination should only be performed in patients who can protect their airway or who are intubated. Severe delirium may develop and require large doses of benzodiazepines for sedation. Seizures (may progress to status epilepticus) may require aggressive use of benzodiazepines, propofol and\/or barbiturates. Monitor core temperature and treat hyperthermia with aggressive benzodiazepine sedation to control agitation, and external cooling. Clinical manifestations may be prolonged due to prolonged absorption in the setting of anticholinergic ileus.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures. For dermal exposure, wash skin thoroughly. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal if recent, substantial ingestion, and patient is able to protect airway. Consider gastric lavage in recent, life threatening ingestion, protect airway prior to gastric lavage.<\/li><li>Airway management: Protect airway early in patients with severe intoxication (i.e., seizures, severe delirium or hyperthermia).<\/li><li>Antidote: Physostigmine is indicated to reverse the CNS effects caused by clinical or toxic dosages of agents capable of producing anticholinergic syndrome; however, long lasting reversal of anticholinergic signs and symptoms is generally not achieved because of the relatively short duration of action of physostigmine (45 to 60 minutes).  It is most often used diagnostically to distinguish anticholinergic delirium from other causes of altered mental status. CAUTION: If tricyclic antidepressants are coingested, physostigmine may precipitate seizures and dysrhythmias. DOSES: ADULT: 2 mg IV at a slow controlled rate, no more than 1 mg\/min. May repeat doses at intervals of 10 to 30 min if severe symptoms recur. For patients with prolonged anticholinergic delirium consider a continuous infusion, start at 2 mg\/hr and titrate to effect. CHILD: 0.02 mg\/kg by slow IV injection, at a rate no more than 0.5 mg\/minute. Repeat dosage at 5 to 10 minute intervals as long as the toxic effect persists and there is no sign of cholinergic effects. MAXIMUM DOSAGE: 2 mg total.<\/li><li>Seizure: Intravenous benzodiazepines; add propofol or barbiturates if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: Control agitation with benzodiazepines, initiate aggressive external cooling measures (i.e., remove patient's clothing, cover with a damp sheet or spray skin with water and direct fan at the patient's skin to enhance evaporation).<\/li><li>Psychomotor agitation: Sedate patient with benzodiazepines as necessary; large doses may be required.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs (including temperature) and mental status.  No specific lab work is needed in most patients. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with moderate to severe toxicity (i.e., agitation, delirium, seizures, coma, hypotension). Monitor creatinine phosphokinase in patients with prolonged agitation, seizures or coma; monitor renal function and urine output in patients with rhabdomyolysis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are of no value in this setting because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children (other than mild drowsiness or stimulation) with an acute inadvertent ingestion may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions and symptomatic patients should be sent to a health care facility for observation for 6 to 8 hours. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous system toxicity (i.e., hallucinations, somnolence, delirium, coma), or persistent tachycardia should be admitted. Patients with coma, seizures or delirium should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (i.e., seizures, severe delirium, coma), or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>INORGANIC PHOSPHATES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Isolated gastrointestinal symptoms do not require treatment; occasionally patients may require antiemetics. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer intravenous fluids to restore electrolyte balance. Replace calcium and magnesium intravenously, but overaggressive repletion can theoretically cause precipitation of calcium phosphate in tissue. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. Patients with respiratory failure should be intubated and ventilated. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and monitor ECG for evidence of QT prolongation or dysrhythmias. Symptomatic patients with severe electrolyte abnormalities should be treated with hemodialysis. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Administration of an aluminum based antacid may bind phosphate and decrease absorption. Activated charcoal is not recommended. HOSPITAL: Phosphates are not bound by activated charcoal. Aluminium salts will bind phosphate and form insoluble aluminum phosphate, so administration of an aluminum based antacid may decrease phosphate absorption, but there are no reports describing this treatment.<\/li><li>Airway management: Is unlikely to be required following overdose. Consider early intubation in patients who develop weakness. Patients with respiratory failure should be intubated and ventilated.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes (including magnesium, calcium, and phosphate) if there is more than a trivial exposure. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Phosphates are rapidly cleared by dialysis. Dialysis can also be used to treat other electrolyte abnormalities such as hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Sip ingestions can be managed at home. However, ingestion of only 30 to 60 mL by a child can produce severe electrolyte abnormalities, so if the history is not clear, the patient should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who require dialysis or who have persistent severe electrolyte abnormalities should be admitted to a monitored setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in decision making whether or not admission is advisable, managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear. Consult a nephrologist for dialysis in patients with severe toxicity.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>METHENAMINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with vomiting or diarrhea. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose of methenamine. Hemorrhagic cystitis is probably caused by methenamine converting to formaldehyde in acid urine. Maintaining dilute and slightly alkaline urine (pH 7 or higher) may prevent this complication. Hydrate to maintain urine output of 1 to 2 mL\/kg\/hr. Consider urinary alkalinization in patients with hematuria or urinary tract irritation.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  INGESTION: Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely, and is generally only expected with chronic use.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. OCULAR: Irrigate exposed eyes with water. DERMAL: Remove contaminated clothes, follow with copious irrigation. INHALATION: Humidified oxygen. HOSPITAL: Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely, and is generally only expected with chronic use.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. Consider activated charcoal only if coingestants with significant toxicity are involved. <\/li><li>Airway management: Should not be required in overdose cases. In case of occupational inhalational exposure, aggressive airway management in patients with any indication of upper airway injury is recommended.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function and urinalysis after significant overdose. Monitor arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, and pulmonary function tests, and obtain a chest x-ray in any patient with severe respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not recommended given the low toxicity of this drug.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  Patients with severe respiratory distress should also be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>METHYLENE BLUE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Inadvertent intrathecal injection has been reported with methylene blue. Monitor neurologic exam. Keep the patient upright and begin aggressive attempts to remove as much as drug possible. Immediately drain AT LEAST 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon immediately for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline (NS) or lactated ringers (LR) through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for at least 24 hours). Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (25 mL FFP\/liter NS or LR) or albumin 5% should be added to the fluid used for perfusion to increase protein binding and replace CSF protein. Administer dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is generally not recommended. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a recent, substantial overdose who is alert or in whom airway is protected.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients with methemoglobinemia and severe dyspnea, tachypnea, seizure, or evidence of end-organ ischemia may require intubation for airway protection or to minimize excessive work of breathing.<\/li><li>Methemoglobinemia: Obtain a methemoglobin level in cyanotic patients. Methemoglobin levels of less than 30% will usually correct themselves in 3 days without treatment being necessary. Profound cyanosis may occur in individuals with methemoglobinemia who appear to be in no respiratory distress. Treat symptomatic patients (generally with methemoglobin concentrations of more than 30% but patients with anemia or underlying cardiopulmonary disease may be symptomatic at lower concentrations) with oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen, and exchange transfusion may be necessary in severe cases.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs in symptomatic patients. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Determine baseline CBC and serum hemoglobin in patients suspected of G-6-PD deficiency. In a cyanotic patient, a methemoglobin level should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Methemoglobin levels will be artificially low if blood is not analyzed within a few hours. Pulse oximetry may give a false reading in the 80% to low 90% range.  An arterial blood gas test will reveal a falsely normal calculated oxygen saturation despite low measured pulse oximetry. If oxygen saturation is measured, it will be low relative to the pO2. This saturation gap suggests methemoglobinemia. <\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with any degree of cyanosis should be referred to a health care facility.  Patients with mild headache or nausea may be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with symptoms of methemoglobinemia should be monitored for several hours. Patients that are asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All patients demonstrating cyanosis with symptoms, or methemoglobin levels greater than 20%, should be admitted. In less severe cases of methemoglobinemia, the possibility of continued absorption of methylene blue must be ruled out before the patient may be safely discharged.  When doubt exists, it is probably best to admit the patient. CONSULT CRITERIA: A medical toxicologist or poison control center should be consulted for patients with methemoglobin concentrations above 30% or for symptomatic patients with lower concentrations. Consultation is recommended for patients with familial methemoglobinemia or G-6-PD deficiency.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jv9ds12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANTICHOLINERGIC POISONING<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULTS: Varies with the specific medication.
