PHARMACOLOGY: Broad spectrum antihelmintic agents that can inhibit the formation of worm microtubules and cause worm glucose depletion. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare; severe toxicity is not anticipated. OVERDOSE: Limited data. There have been few reported cases of overdose with these agents, and the events were similar to adverse reactions seen with therapeutic administration at high doses. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Gastrointestinal events (eg, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting) are likely to occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not anticipated. Hepatic injury (elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis) or alterations in hematopoietic function (eg, neutropenia, agranulocytosis) may develop following a significant exposure. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Mild gastrointestinal events may occur.  Hematuria has been occasionally reported during therapy with these agents. Elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, neutropenia and agranulocytosis are rare events associated with prolonged, high-dose therapy. Seizures have been reported very rarely. Mental status changes (drowsiness, dizziness, irritability) and headaches have been reported during therapeutic use; one case of seizures and one case of Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"7s96s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MEBENDAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Replace fluids and electrolytes in patients that develop significant diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Monitor hepatic enzymes in patients with a significant exposure. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive; severe toxicity is not anticipated. Monitor liver enzymes and hematopoietic function in patients at risk. Hepatitis has been rarely reported with therapy. Monitor for alterations in CNS function.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Decontamination is unlikely to be necessary; vomiting may occur following an acute exposure. HOSPITAL: Decontamination is unlikely to be necessary. Activated charcoal may be considered if a significant, recent ingestion has occurred and the patient is able to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary. In rare cases, airway protection and support may be necessary in patients that develop significant CNS depression or seizures.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance. Liver enzymes may be elevated while on these agents, and should likely be evaluated following an overdose. Monitor CBC with differential following a significant exposure; neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been rarely observed following chronic therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Limited data. Hemodialysis was not found to be effective in altering mebendazole kinetics.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic adult or child with an inadvertent minor exposure (eg, a single dose) may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients with gastrointestinal or CNS effects should be treated and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients may be discharged to home once symptoms have resolved and laboratory studies (ie, hematologic, hepatic) are within normal limits. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent symptoms should be admitted for further treatment. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated by a mental health specialist.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"7s96s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MEBENDAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established for these agents.
