The risk for NSF is greatest in patients with acute kidney injury or chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR less than 30 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2). Evaluate patients for acute kidney injury or other conditions which may reduce renal function. Patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (eg, age greater than 60 years, hypertension, or diabetes) should have their estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) determined through laboratory testing.
