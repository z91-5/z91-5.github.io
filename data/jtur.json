Occupationally, nitric oxide is used in the manufacture of nitric acid, in the bleaching of rayon, and as a raw material for nitrosyl halide preparation. TOXICOLOGY: Nitric oxide gas is an asphyxiant which may cause pulmonary toxicity. In the presence of oxygen, it is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide and higher oxides of nitrogen which can produce severe pulmonary toxicity. Nitric oxide is a skin, eye, mucous membrane, and irritant; due to the formation of nitric and nitrous acid, which can permanently alter proteins. Because this reaction is relatively slow, permanent tissue injury may possibly be prevented by IMMEDIATE decontamination. Pulmonary edema may develop after a delay of 4 to 72 hours. Following inhalation, nitric oxide can combine with hemoglobin to form nitrosylhemoglobin; this is rapidly oxidized to methemoglobin; resulting in reduction of oxygen transport by red blood cells. Methemoglobin of more than 1.5 g\/dL can cause central and peripheral cyanosis. Nitric oxide is a potent endogenous vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Nitric oxide can be toxic by inhalation and absorption through the skin or eyes. Oral exposure is quite rare, since this material is a gas under ambient conditions. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nitric oxide exposure causes skin, eye, mucosal, and respiratory irritation. Initial signs\/symptoms may include coughing and burning in the throat and chest, nausea, and shortness of breath. SEVERE TOXICITY: In severe cases, hypotension, pulmonary injury, and methemoglobinemia may be present; latent symptoms may include nervousness, rapid and shallow breathing, cyanosis, mental confusion, and finally loss of consciousness. Hyperpnea and dyspnea may be seen after some delay. Rapid and shallow respirations, coughing and burning in the throat and chest, and physical signs of pulmonary edema may develop; pulmonary edema may develop after a delay of 4 to 72 hours. EFFECTS IN PREGNANCY: Methemoglobin inducers are considered especially hazardous to the fetus. This is because fetal hemoglobin is more readily oxidized than an adult, because it is converted back to hemoglobin more slowly than an adult, and also because the need for oxygen in the developing fetus is more critical than in the adult. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Administration of nitric oxide can cause severe systemic hypotension in newborns with persistent pulmonary hypertension associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Abrupt withdrawal of therapeutic nitric oxide may result in hypoxemia, oxygen desaturation, and increased pulmonary hypertension. <br\/>"},{"id":"jturs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>NITRIC OXIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment for mild and moderate symptoms consists of predominantly decontamination, removal from exposure, and symptomatic and supportive care. All patients with a significant exposure (either inhalation, eye, dermal, or oral exposure) should be carefully observed for the possible development of delayed clinical signs and symptoms. INHALATION: Move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer 100% humidified supplemental oxygen, perform endotracheal intubation and provide assisted ventilation as required. Administer inhaled beta 2 adrenergic agonists and systemic steroid, if bronchospasm develops. DERMAL: Remove contaminated clothes and wash exposed area extremely thoroughly with soap and water. Treat dermal irritation or burns with standard topical therapy. Patients developing dermal hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with systemic or topical corticosteroids or antihistamines. OCULAR: Remove contact lenses and irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation or photophobia persist, the patient should be seen in a healthcare facility. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients who develop severe toxicity with hypotension should be treated first with IV fluids, if hypotension persists, the addition of vasopressors (eg, dopamine or norepinephrine) may be required. ACUTE LUNG INJURY: Maintain ventilation and oxygenation and evaluate with frequent arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry monitoring. Early use of PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed. METHEMOGLOBINEMIA: Administer 1 to 2 mg\/kg (0.1 to 0.2 mL\/kg\/dose) of methylene blue slowly IV in symptomatic patients. Additional doses may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL OR HOSPITAL: INHALATION: Move patient to fresh air. DERMAL: Remove contaminated clothes and wash exposed area extremely thoroughly with soap and water. Treat dermal irritation or burns with standard topical therapy. Patients developing dermal hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with systemic or topical corticosteroids or antihistamines. OCULAR: Remove contact lenses and irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation or photophobia persist, the patient should be seen in a healthcare facility. INGESTION: Oral exposure is unlikely to occur since this agent is a gas under ambient conditions. Normally exposure causes irritation to oral and respiratory mucosa, emesis is contraindicated. There is no known data to suggest the efficacy of nitric oxide binding to activated charcoal. PERSONNEL PROTECTION: Rescuers must be protected from inhalation by self-contained breathing and from contact by plastic gloves.<\/li><li>Airway management: Move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer 100% humidified supplemental oxygen, perform endotracheal intubation and provide assisted ventilation as required. Administer inhaled beta 2 adrenergic agonists and systemic steroid, if bronchospasm develops.<\/li><li>Antidote: METHYLENE BLUE for METHEMOGLOBINEMIA: Determine the methemoglobin concentration and evaluate the patient for clinical effects of methemoglobinemia (ie, dyspnea, headache, fatigue, CNS depression, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis). Treat patients with symptomatic methemoglobinemia with methylene blue (this usually occurs at methemoglobin concentrations above 20% to 30%, but may occur at lower methemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia, or underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disorders). Administer oxygen while preparing for methylene blue therapy. INITIAL DOSE\/ADULT OR CHILD:  1 to 2 mg\/kg\/dose (0.1 to 0.2 mL\/kg\/dose) IV over 5 minutes with a 30 mL flush of normal saline as needed every 4 hours. Improvement is noted shortly after administration if diagnosis is correct.  Methylene blue may also be given by intraosseous infusion if intravenous access cannot be established. Additional doses may be required. NEONATES: DOSE: 0.3 to 1 mg\/kg. FAILURE: Failure of methylene blue therapy suggests: inadequate dose of methylene blue, inadequate decontamination, NADPH dependent methemoglobin reductase deficiency, hemoglobin M disease, sulfhemoglobinemia, or G-6-PD deficiency.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor pulmonary function in symptomatic patients. Monitor pulse oximetry or arterial blood gases and chest radiograph in patients with respiratory symptoms. Monitor methemoglobin levels in symptomatic or cyanotic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to rapid nitric oxide inactivation by hemoglobin, hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are NOT beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: All patients with a presumed nitric oxide exposure should be advised of a possible delay in severe symptoms. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients who have been observed for several hours after a minimal exposure and remain asymptomatic may be treated as outpatients. They should be advised to seek medical care promptly if symptoms develop. All patients with a significant exposure (either inhalation, eye, or dermal exposure) should be carefully observed for the possible development of delayed clinical signs and symptoms in a controlled setting for 24 to 48 hours. A patient whose symptoms resolve within 24 to 36 hours may be released with a follow-up appointment to assess pulmonary status. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant symptoms should be admitted for treatment and monitoring. Patients with hypotension or respiratory failure should be admitted to an ICU setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a local poison center or a toxicologist for any patient with severe toxicity. For patients with eye exposure, consult an ophthalmologist for assistance with an ophthalmic examination as needed.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jturs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>NITRIC OXIDE<\/b><br\/>TOXIC DOSE: Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health: 100 ppm.
