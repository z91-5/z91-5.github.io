PHARMACOLOGY: Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3) and RTKs. This inhibits tumor growth and cancer progression by interrupting cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha, KIT, and RET. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an exaggeration of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. In patients receiving up to 40 mg of lenvatinib, similar adverse effects were reported following the recommended doses of lenvatinib. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (greater than or equal to 30%): Hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, arthralgia\/myalgia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, nausea, stomatitis, headache, vomiting, proteinuria, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, abdominal pain, and dysphonia. OTHER EFFECTS: Hypotension, constipation, oral pain, dry mouth, dyspepsia, peripheral edema, dehydration, dysgeusia, dizziness, rash, alopecia, hyperkeratosis, cough, epistaxis, insomnia, dental and oral infections, urinary tract infection, prolonged QT interval, increased serum creatinine, elevated liver enzymes, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, increased lipase level, decreased platelet count. DRUG INTERACTION: Concurrent administration of lenvatinib with rifampicin or ketoconazole can increase lenvatinib AUC and Cmax, possibly resulting in toxicity. <br\/>"},{"id":"931349-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LENVATINIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Therapeutic doses of lenvatinib may cause prolongation of the QT interval. In patients with QT prolongation, monitor serum electrolytes including potassium, calcium and magnesium in patients with significant overdose; correct any abnormalities. At the time of this review, torsades de pointes has not been reported with therapy.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias or hemorrhagic events.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. In patients with an lenvatinib overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum lenvatinib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice. Monitor vital signs, liver enzymes, and renal function following a significant overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes, including calcium levels, in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs. If QT prolongation develops, monitor serum electrolytes including potassium, calcium and magnesium. Correct any abnormalities. Monitor for evidence of arterial thromboembolic events. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count following an overdose. Monitor for clinical evidence of bleeding. Monitor TSH levels in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (98% to 99%).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestion of one extra dose can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than one extra dose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931349-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>LENVATINIB<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: In patients receiving up to 40 mg of lenvatinib, similar adverse effects were reported following the recommended doses of lenvatinib.
