EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICOLOGY: Similar to other atypical antipsychotic agents, in that it has a lower propensity to produce extrapyramidal effects. It does have alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist activity which may produce hypotension and other hemodynamic effects. PHARMACOLOGY: Asenapine belongs to dibenzo-oxepino pyrroles class. Although the mechanism remains unknown, it appears that asenapine exerts its effect through a combination of antagonist activity at D2 and 5-HT(2A) receptors. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Limited experience. Doses up to 400 mg have resulted in agitation and confusion. SEVERE POISONING: At the time of this review, there is no information on severe toxicity with asenapine. Severe overdose might cause hypotension and altered mental status. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The most common events reported with therapeutic use in the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder include: akathisia, oral hypoesthesia, somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (excluding akathisia) and weight gain. Other frequent adverse events: headache, insomnia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (ie, dysphagia, oral hypoesthesia, vomiting, constipation). Infrequent but potentially serious events: hypotension, QT prolongation, neutropenia\/leukopenia, hyperglycemia, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. <br\/>"},{"id":"jx64s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ASENAPINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Limited experience. Monitor neurologic status; protect airway and intubate as necessary. Monitor patients for hypotension. Initially treat with 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. If necessary, add dopamine or norepinephrine. Serial ECGs to evaluate for QT prolongation or dysrhythmias.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Decontamination is rarely indicated. Severe toxicity is unlikely and oral bioavailability (ie, ingestion rather than sublingual administration) is very low (2%). Consider activated charcoal after a very large ingestion if the patient is awake and able to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may rarely be required in patients with significant CNS depression.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Monitor blood pressure.
