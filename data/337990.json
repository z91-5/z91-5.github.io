It is also subject to diversion and abuse for its euphoric effects. PHARMACOLOGY: Levorphanol is a potent synthetic mu-agonist opioid that exerts its action at receptors in the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter in the brain and spinal cord, thus altering transmission and perception of pain. Levorphanol produces morphine-like analgesia but it is 4 to 8 times as potent as morphine and has a longer half-life. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon, but can be life-threatening. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Lethargy, dizziness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and pinpoint pupils may occur. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE TOXICITY: Respiratory depression may occur leading to apnea, hypoxia, extreme somnolence progressing to stupor and coma, bradycardia, and severe hypotension. Circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur in severe overdoses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported following levorphanol use: Lethargy, dizziness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, difficulty in urination, dry mouth, altered mood and mentation, pruritus, rash, urticaria, abdominal pain, diplopia, pupillary disorder, abnormal vision, seizures, amnesia, insomnia, coma, hypokinesia, dyskinesia, CNS stimulation, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, acute renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, palpitations, extrasystoles, cardiac arrest, apnea, hypoventilation, and respiratory depression. <br\/>"},{"id":"337990-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LEVORPHANOL<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Do not administer activated charcoal because of the risk of CNS depression or seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed, but may occasionally be necessary. A CONTINUOUS infusion may be necessary in patients that have ingested a large overdose. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1 to 2 hours. Levorphanol has a longer duration of effect, so it is necessary to observe the patient at least 3 to 4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Levorphanol plasma concentrations are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may not detect synthetic opioids such as levorphanol, and are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Obtain acetaminophen and salicylate levels and serum electrolytes in patients with a self harm ingestion as other products may be involved. Other routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of levorphanol toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT or lumbar puncture, or both to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value because of the large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose. Children with inadvertent ingestions evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate ingestions, adults who have ingested more than a therapeutic dose, and any pediatric ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for observation for at least 4 hours, as peak plasma levels and symptoms will likely develop within this time period. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant persistent central nervous depression or seizures should be admitted to the hospital. Patients needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as they may need additional doses. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, or delirium or those needing a naloxone infusion or intubated patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"337990-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>LEVORPHANOL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose is not established and depends on individual patient tolerance.
