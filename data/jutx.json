ADVERSE EFFECTS: FREQUENT - Infusion-related effects including N\/V, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, pruritus, fever, rigors, bronchospasm, and hypotension are fairly common. Syncope, respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest are rare infusion-related effects.
