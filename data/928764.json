Immunize patients with a meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of eculizumab, unless the risks of delaying eculizumab therapy outweigh the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Monitor patients for early signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected. Eculizumab is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the eculizumab REMS prescribers must enroll in the program.
