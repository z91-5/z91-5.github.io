PHARMACOLOGY: Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue that has antitumor activity. It has cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase), and also blocks the progression of cells through the G1\/S-phase boundary.  Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly by nucleoside kinases to the active diphosphate (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. Its cytotoxic effect is attributed to a combination of two actions of the diphosphate and the triphosphate nucleosides, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis. TOXICOLOGY: After overdose, the effects of decreased DNA synthesis and cell death are noticed primarily in organ systems with rapidly dividing cells (bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Clinical events in overdose are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects. A single dose of 5700 mg\/m(2) of gemcitabine given intravenously over 30 minutes every 2 weeks resulted in myelosuppression, paresthesias, and severe rash (primary toxicities) in several patients during a Phase I clinical trial. Severe toxicity was reported during a phase III clinical trial in which several patients received 6400 mg\/m(2) of gemcitabine. One patient developed bullous skin ulceration and another severe mucositis with hemorrhagic ulceration and necrosis. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, mild dyspnea, mild peripheral edema, elevated liver enzymes, mild proteinuria and hematuria, macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic rash may occur with therapy. The primary dose-limiting toxicity has been myelosuppression, but less than 1% of patients required discontinuation of therapy due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, or leukopenia. INFREQUENT: Acute lung injury, pulmonary edema, mild paresthesias, mucositis and stomatitis may develop. RARE: Hemolytic uremic syndrome has been reported. Several cases of fatal pulmonary toxicity, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary hemorrhage have also occurred. In most cases, symptoms developed after several doses\/cycles of gemcitabine. Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, dysrhythmia, hypotension, and hypertension) have been reported; however, most patients had a prior history of cardiac disease. <br\/>"},{"id":"923608-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>GEMCITABINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. <\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports of intrathecal injection of gemcitabine are available. The following recommendations are based on experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative-free NS or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary as gemcitabine is administered intravenously.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe respiratory symptoms, cardiotoxicity, or acute allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors if patients develop severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Supplemental oxygen; PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. For example: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with a gemcitabine overdose in whom neutropenia and mucositis would be anticipated, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Gemcitabine is classified as a neutral agent by one source. Another classified it as an irritant. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Elevate the affected area. Apply ice packs for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily. Another source recommended warm\/heat packs for local reaction. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable). Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose; however, early hemodialysis would be expected to effectively clear gemcitabine based on its small volume of distribution and low protein binding.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum gemcitabine concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice. Monitor vital signs, serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Monitor patients closely for the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Myelosuppression has been reported. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Clinically evaluate patients for the development of mucositis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. All overdoses should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Exposed patients should be evaluated and observed for 6 hours. If patients are asymptomatic for 6 hours, they may be sent home, but toxic effects may be delayed, so patients should return to a healthcare provider for any symptoms and should have blood work monitored as an outpatient (eg, CBC for myelosuppression). ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any symptomatic patient should be admitted to the hospital, and depending on the severity of their symptoms, either to the floor or ICU. Criteria for discharge should be resolution of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with an overdose. Consult a nephrologist if hemolytic uremic syndrome develops. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe myelosuppression may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923608-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>GEMCITABINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A single dose as high as 5700 mg\/m(2) IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks resulted in myelosuppression, paresthesias and severe rash.
