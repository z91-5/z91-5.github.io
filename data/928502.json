multi-kinase inhibitor, is used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumor after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate. It is also used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. PHARMACOLOGY: Sunitinib inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), some of which are implicated in tumor growth, pathologic angiogenesis, and metastatic progression of cancer. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Data limited. There is one case of an intentional ingestion of 1500 mg of sunitinib with no adverse effects reported. Following a few cases of inadvertent overdose, the adverse events were similar to events reported with therapeutic use or no adverse reactions developed. In general, the signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse reaction reported with therapy: fatigue, asthenia, fever, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis\/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, peripheral edema, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration, dry skin, hair color changes, altered taste, headache, back pain, arthralgia, extremity pain, cough, dyspnea, anorexia, and bleeding. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions include: fatigue (8%), hypertension (8%), asthenia (5%), diarrhea (5%), hand-foot syndrome (5%), nausea (4%), abdominal pain (3%), anorexia (3%), mucositis (2%), vomiting (2%) and hypothyroidism (2%). SERIOUS: Potentially serious adverse events that have been reported with sunitinib therapy or following postmarketing surveillance include bleeding events (ie, gastrointestinal, rectal, genital and wound bleeding); epistaxis was the most common event. Other hematologic events include neutrophil and leukocyte abnormalities, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular events include left ventricular dysfunction, dose-dependent prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes (infrequent). Other serious events include hepatotoxicity (includes liver failure), proteinuria, renal impairment\/injury, tumor lysis syndrome, thyroid dysfunction and dermatologic events (ie, necrotizing fascitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis) and significant systemic infections (with and without neutropenia). DRUG INTERACTION: Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor can increase sunitinib concentrations. <br\/>"},{"id":"928502-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>SUNITINIB <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited data following overdose. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote. Monitor vital signs frequently. Hypertension has developed with therapy; for mild to moderate elevations no therapy may be needed. Monitor liver enzymes and renal function; repeat as indicated.  For persistent vomiting, treat with antiemetics and fluid and electrolyte replacement for ongoing symptom. Obtain baseline serum electrolytes and urinalysis. Monitor cardiac function for evidence of left ventricular dysfunction (ie, CHF symptoms) or cardiac dysrhythmias (prolonged QT interval or torsades de pointes) following a significant overdose. Obtain a baseline ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Hemorrhagic events including fatal cases of GI, respiratory, tumor, urinary tract and brain have occurred with sunitinib therapy; epistaxis is most common. Carefully monitor for evidence of bleeding and obtain serial CBC with differential. Myelosuppression may develop. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  For severe hypertension, sodium nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives. BLEEDING: For prolonged or significant bleeding, platelet and red cell transfusions may be necessary. MYELOSUPPRESSION may develop. Colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or sargramostim) should be administered if severe neutropenia develops. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Severe infections with and without neutropenia have developed with therapy. OTHER: Thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, and severe dermatologic toxicities (ie, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with therapy; monitor and treat as indicated.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because vomiting may develop after exposure. Activated charcoal may be indicated if the ingestion is recent and the patient is not vomiting and the airway is protected.  HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias or as indicated.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote for sunitinib.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Hypertension has been reported with therapeutic use of sunitinib; treat with standard antihypertensive therapy. Monitor vital signs regularly. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. For severe hypertension, sodium nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Prolonged QT interval: Therapeutic doses of sunitinib have produced prolongation of the QT interval and infrequent reports of torsades de pointes. Concomitant use of sunitinib and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Concomitant use of sunitinib and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes.  Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium; atrial overdrive pacing may be necessary.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULTS: 1 to 2 g IV (mixed in 50 to 100 mL D5W) infused over 5 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILDREN: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Rates of 100 to 120 beats\/min may terminate torsades. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Hemorrhage: Hemorrhagic events including fatal cases of GI, respiratory, tumor, urinary tract and brain have occurred with sunitinib therapy; epistaxis is most common bleeding event reported. Carefully monitor for evidence of bleeding and obtain serial CBC with differential. Other hematologic effects include thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.  Monitor serial CBC with differential following an overdose. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors to patients with severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential for evidence of bone marrow suppression. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. If fever or infection develop during leukopenic phase, cultures should be obtained and appropriate antibiotics started. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Mucositis\/stomatitis has been reported with therapeutic use of sunitinib. Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with a sunitinib overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor liver enzymes and renal function after a significant overdose. Obtain a baseline urinalysis and repeat as indicated following an overdose. Hematologic events including bleeding, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia can occur. Monitor serial CBC with differential following an overdose and assess for physical evidence of bleeding (ie, GI, respiratory, tumor, urinary tract and brain). In patients with neutropenia, monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Obtain a baseline ECG in patients with a significant exposure; repeat as indicated. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (95%) and large volume of distribution (2230 L) of sunitinib.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of 1 or 2 extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than 1 or 2 extra doses should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be admitted. Patients with persistent cardiac dysrhythmias, mental status changes or evidence of hemorrhagic events should be admitted to an ICU setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928502-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>SUNITINIB<\/b><br\/>TOXIC DOSE: A toxic dose has not been established.
