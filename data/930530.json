Use is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dextran 40, hydroxyethylstarch, or human serum albumin. Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is expected and may be fatal. Administration of immunosuppressive therapy may decrease the risk of GVHD. Engraftment syndrome may progress to multiorgan failure and death. Treat engraftment syndrome promptly with corticosteroids. Graft failure may be fatal. Monitor patients for laboratory evidence of hematopoietic recovery. Prior to choosing a specific unit of hematopoietic progenitor cells, cord blood, consider testing for HLA antibodies to identify patients who are alloimmunized.<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"930530-s-3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"930530-s-3-9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"<ul><li>hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dextran 40, or plasma proteins<\/li><li>hypersensitivity to hydroxyethylstarch (Ducord)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930530-s-3-10","title":"Precautions","mono":"<ul><li>engraftment syndrome has been reported; may progress to multiorgan failure and death; corticosteroids are recommended if condition occurs<\/li><li>infusion reactions, severe and with fatalities (eg, respiratory distress, severe bronchospasm, severe bradycardia with heart block or other arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, hypotension, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, renal compromise, encephalopathy, loss of consciousness, seizure), have been reported; premedication may reduce the incidence and severity; monitoring is recommended; infusion discontinuation may be necessary<\/li><li>graft-versus-host disease, acute and chronic, may occur; immunosuppressive drugs are recommended to decrease the risk<\/li><li>allergic reactions (eg, bronchospasm, wheezing, angioedema, pruritus, hives) may occur<\/li><li>antibiotic allergy, history; residual antibiotics may be present; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>genetic diseases, rare, involving the hematopoietic system may be transmitted<\/li><li>human plasma derivative; infectious agent risk, including viruses<\/li><li>hypersensitivity reactions, serious and including anaphylaxis, have been reported<\/li><li>leukemia has been reported; donor origin<\/li><li>posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder may occur; higher incidence in patients who have received antithymocyte globulin; monitoring of high-risk groups recommended<\/li><li>primary graft failure has been reported and may be fatal; testing for HLA antibodies prior to transplantation should be considered; monitoring is recommended<\/li><li>report suspected adverse reactions to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov\/medwatch<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930530-s-3-11","title":"Pregnancy Category","mono":"C (FDA)<br\/>"},{"id":"930530-s-3-12","title":"Breast Feeding","mono":"Micromedex: Infant risk cannot be ruled out.<br\/>"}]},"5":{"id":"930530-s-5","title":"Adverse Effects","mono":"<b>Common<\/b><ul><li><b>Cardiovascular:<\/b>Hypertension (48%), Sinus bradycardia (10.4%)<\/li><li><b>Gastrointestinal:<\/b>Nausea (12.7%), Vomiting (14.5%)<\/li><li><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Infusion reaction (13% to 19%)<\/li><\/ul><b>Serious<\/b><br\/><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Anaphylaxis, Engraftment syndrome (15%), Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder<br\/>"},"6":{"id":"930530-s-6","title":"Drug Name Info","sub":{"0":{"id":"930530-s-6-17","title":"US Trade Names","mono":"<ul><li>Allocord<\/li><li>Ducord<\/li><li>Hemacord<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"930530-s-6-20","title":"Regulatory Status","mono":"RX<br\/>"}}},"7":{"id":"930530-s-7","title":"Mechanism Of Action","mono":"After administration of hematopoietic progenitor cell cord blood, the stem cells migrate to the bone marrow where they divide and mature.
