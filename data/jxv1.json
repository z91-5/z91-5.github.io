Naturally occurring human GLP-2 is a peptide secreted by L-cells of the distal intestine. GLP-2 increases intestinal and portal blood flow, and inhibits gastric acid secretion. Teduglutide binds to GLP-2 receptors in the intestinal subpopulations of enteroendocrine cells, subepithelial myofibroblasts, and enteric neurons of the submucosal and myenteric plexus. Activation of GLP-2 receptors leads to local release of insulin-like growth factor, nitric oxide, and keratinocyte growth factor. Administration of teduglutide improves intestinal absorption in patients with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jxv1s8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"jxv1s8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Tmax, subQ; 3 to 5 hours<\/li><li>Tmax, subQ; renal impairment: 4 to 4.5 hours<\/li><li>Bioavailability, subQ: 88%<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxv1s8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: 103 mL\/kg <br\/>"},{"id":"jxv1s8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"small peptides and amino acids: unknown <br\/>"},{"id":"jxv1s8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal clearance: extensive<\/li><li>Total body clearance: 123 mL\/hr\/kg<\/li><li>Total body clearance, renal impairment: decreased; 4.83  L\/hr (moderate), 6.21 L\/hr (severe); 7.52 L\/hr (ESRD)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxv1s8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Healthy subjects, 2 hours  to 6 hours<\/li><li>Short bowel syndrome, 1.3 hours<\/li><\/ul>"}]},"9":{"id":"jxv1s9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>do not administer by IV or IM injection<br\/><\/li><li><b>Subcutaneous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute with 0.5 mL of sterile water for injection (provided in prefilled syringe) and let stand for 30 seconds<\/li><li>gently roll vial for 15 seconds and then let stand for about 2 minutes; do not shake<\/li><li>if undissolved powder is visible, gently roll vial again; do not use product if it remains undissolved after second attempt<\/li><li>administer within 3 hours of reconstitution; discard unused portion<\/li><li>alternate injection sites (eg, arms, thighs, and quadrants of the abdomen)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jxv1s10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>reduction in weekly parenteral nutrition (PN) or IV support may indicate efficacy<\/li><li>bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase and amylase; within 6 months of initiating therapy, and at least every 6 months while on therapy, or more frequently if required.<\/li><li>electrolyte status; upon discontinuation of treatment.<\/li><li>colonoscopy or alternative imaging of the entire colon with removal of polyps; within 6 months of initiating treatment, after 1 years of treatment, then at least every 5 years if no polyp is found, or per current polyp followup guidelines if a polyp is found<\/li><li>fluid status; upon discontinuation of treatment.<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of small bowel neoplasms<\/li><li>gallbladder and\/or biliary tract imaging if clinical meaningful changes in bilirubin and\/or alkaline phosphatase levels are seen<\/li><li>pancreatic imaging if clinically meaningful changes in lipase and\/or amylase are seen<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jxv1s11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Gattex<\/b><br\/>  Kit: 5 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"jxv1s13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>This drug may cause abdominal pain, injection site reactions, swelling of stoma, nausea, headaches, abdominal distension, upper respiratory tract infections, or vomiting.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of intestinal obstruction.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report signs\/symptoms of cholecystitis, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, or pancreatic disease to a healthcare professional.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of fluid overload or cardiac decompensation.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report a severe reaction, including severe rash, to a healthcare professional.<\/li><li>Teach patient proper injection technique and placement of injections.<\/li><li>Advise patient to rotate injection sites.<\/li><li>Advise patient there are multiple significant drug-drug interactions for this drug.
