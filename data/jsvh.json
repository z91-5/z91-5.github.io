It is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and rapid sedation of patients with undifferentiated agitation. It is also used to treat patients with bipolar I disorder. PHARMACOLOGY: Olanzapine is a dopamine, serotonin, muscarinic, and histamine receptor antagonist. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicity is an extension of the pharmacology. In overdose, olanzapine also acts as an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist and may cause hypotension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures to olanzapine are common. Most patients have mild to moderate sedation, but some patients will require life support. Deaths are rare from single-substance ingestions. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Somnolence, ataxia, extrapyramidal effects, tachycardia, miosis, and nystagmus have been reported. SEVERE TOXICITY: Seizures, delirium, coma, respiratory depression, hypotension, oculogyric crisis, and central diabetes insipidus have been reported. The most common effects are CNS depression, which may progress to coma, delirium, and hypotension. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, sedation, dizziness, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, elevated liver enzymes, arthralgia, extremity pain, elevated serum CPK, anticholinergic effects, orthostasis, agitation, insomnia, nervousness, constipation, and dry mouth have been reported with therapeutic use. Long-term use may cause weight gain and glucose intolerance. In the postmarketing period, there have been rare reports of hepatitis and cholestatic or mixed liver injury. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), due to dopaminergic blockade, associated with olanzapine therapy has been reported, but is rare. <br\/>"},{"id":"jsvhs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OLANZAPINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Hypotension usually responds to IV fluids. Sedated patients should be monitored to assure that their airway remains patent. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Intubate patients with significant CNS depression. Hypotension that does not respond to IV fluids should be treated with sympathomimetic agents. Agents with beta adrenergic activity such as epinephrine or dopamine may worsen hypotension in the setting of olanzapine-induced alpha blockade. Agents with alpha adrenergic effects such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine may be preferred. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Consider intravenous lipid therapy early for patients with ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: No prehospital decontamination is recommended. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal to patients who are awake and can protect after a recent, significant ingestion. Gastric lavage is not recommended as overdose is rarely life threatening.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients with significant CNS depression should be intubated.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Fat emulsion: Patients who develop significant cardiovascular toxicity should be treated with intravenous lipids. Administer 1.5 mL\/kg of 20% lipid emulsion over 2 to 3 minutes as an IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min. If possible, discontinue after 30 to 60 minutes. Longer periods of lipid therapy should be considered if the patient's hemodynamic stability is dependent on continued lipid infusion.<\/li><li>Drug-induced dystonia: ADULT: Benztropine 1 to 2 mg IV or diphenhydramine 1 mg\/kg\/dose IV over 2 minutes. CHILD: Diphenhydramine 1 mg\/kg\/dose IV over 2 minutes (maximum 5 mg\/kg\/day or 50 mg\/m(2)\/day).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor CK in patients with prolonged agitation or coma. Obtain serial ECGs; institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Olanzapine can be quantified in serum, but the test is not widely available and not useful to guide treatment.<\/li><li>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Oral bromocriptine, benzodiazepines or oral or IV dantrolene in conjunction with cooling and other supportive measures.<\/li><li>Priapism: Priapism may occur rarely following an overdose of atypical neuroleptics, including olanzapine. An immediate urological consult is necessary. Clinical history should include the use of other agents (ie, antihypertensives, antidepressants, illegal agents) that may also be contributing to priapism. In a patient with ischemic priapism the corpora cavernosa are often completely rigid and the patient complains of pain, while nonischemic priapism the corpora are typically tumescent, but not completely rigid and pain is not typical. Aspirate blood from the corpus cavernosum with a fine needle. Blood gas testing of the aspirated blood may be used to distinguish ischemic (typically PO2 less than 30 mmHg, PCO2 greater than 60 mmHg, and pH less than 7.25) and nonischemic priapism. Color duplex ultrasonography may also be useful. If priapism persists after aspiration, inject a sympathomimetic. PHENYLEPHRINE: Dose: Adult: For intracavernous injection, dilute phenylephrine with normal saline for a concentration of 100 to 500 mcg\/mL and give 1 mL injections every 3 to 5 minutes for approximately 1 hour (before deciding that treatment is not successful). For children and patients with cardiovascular disease: Use lower concentrations in smaller volumes. NOTE: Treatment is less likely to be effective if done more than 48 hours after the development of priapism. Distal shunting (NOT first-line therapy) should only be considered after a trial of intracavernous injection of sympathomimetics.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Not useful because of the large volume of distribution of olanzapine.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  Children less than 12 years of age who are naive to olanzapine can be observed at home following an unintentional ingestion of 10 mg or less and are only experiencing mild sedation. All patients, 12 years of age or older, who are naive to olanzapine, can be observed at home following an unintentional ingestion of 25 mg or less and are experiencing only mild sedation. All patients who are taking olanzapine on a chronic basis can be observed at home if they have acutely ingested no more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) of olanzapine. Patients who have not developed signs or symptoms more than 6 hours after ingestion are unlikely to develop toxicity. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with a deliberate ingestion or more than minor symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility. Children less than 12 years of age who are naive to olanzapine should be referred to a healthcare facility following an unintentional ingestion of more than 10 mg. All patients, 12 years of age or older, who are naive to olanzapine should be referred to a healthcare facility following an unintentional ingestion of more than 25 mg. All patients who are taking olanzapine on a chronic basis should be referred to a healthcare facility following an acute ingestion of more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) of olanzapine.
