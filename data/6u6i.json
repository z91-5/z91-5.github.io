PHARMACOLOGY: Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with both analgesic and antipyretic activities. The exact mechanism of action is unknown but its anti-inflammatory effect is thought to be related to its ability to inhibit prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, to its antibradykinin activity, as well as its lysosomal membrane-stabilizing action. TOXICOLOGY: NSAIDs cause gastrointestinal irritation directly, and by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which is necessary for the formation of the prostaglandins PG12 and PGE2; decrease in these prostaglandins results in decreased tissue mucus and bicarbonate secretion, increased hydrochloride secretion, and decreased gastric blood flow. The acidosis associated with severe NSAID overdose appears to result from the formation acidic metabolites, and mild hypotension. Prostaglandin inhibition by NSAIDs also causes renal arteriolar constriction, reduced renal blood flow and subsequent renal insufficiency in patients with conditions characterized by high angiotensin and low intravascular volume (eg, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, hypovolemia). COX-1 inhibition also decreases the formation of thromboxane A2 which is necessary for platelet aggregation, predisposing patients to bleeding. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE OVERDOSE: Reported effects of acute ketoprofen overdose are usually mild and include CNS depression (lethargy, drowsiness) or stimulation and gastrointestinal irritation (nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain). Symptoms develop soon after ingestion and usually resolve within 24 hours. SEVERE OVERDOSE: Rare effects include gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, tachycardia, psychosis; seizures have occurred following mixed ingestion overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dyspepsia (11%). OTHER EFFECTS (3% TO 9%): Nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, flatulence, headache, dizziness, CNS inhibition (ie, depression, malaise, somnolence) or excitation (ie, insomnia, nervousness), and impaired renal function (ie, edema, increased BUN). RARE: Anorexia, vomiting, stomatitis, tinnitus, visual disturbance, rash, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated liver enzymes, hypertension, palpitations, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, hemoptysis, dyspnea, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, pruritus, skin eruptions, ecchymoses, sweating, purpura photosensitivity reactions, alopecia, and anaphylactoid reactions.

Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and subsequent aspiration.
