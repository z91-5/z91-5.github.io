Celecoxib (Celebrex) is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and is the only remaining COX-2 inhibitor on the market in the US. Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was voluntarily removed from the market in 2004 due to concerns for increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, and valdecoxib (Bextra) was removed in 2005 for similar reasons. Etoricoxib (Arcoxia), lumiracoxib (Prexige), and parecoxib (Dynastat) [a prodrug of valdecoxib] are not approved for use in the US, but are available in other countries. PHARMACOLOGY: The cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme (prostaglandin synthase H) consists of 2 isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-2 inhibitors decrease the synthesis of prostaglandin H2 by selectively inhibiting COX-2 (from 30- to 433-fold more potent towards COX-2 in vitro) with little or no inhibition of COX-1 at therapeutic doses. Although similar to traditional NSAIDs, selective inhibition of COX-2 may result in fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects usually associated with NSAIDs. TOXICOLOGY: At supratherapeutic doses, selective inhibition of COX-2 is lost, and the usual COX-1 effects may manifest in the GI tract as gastritis, and in the renal system as hypertension, decreased renal perfusion, decreased glomerular filtration rate, edema, and interstitial nephritis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: COX-2 inhibitors are an uncommon cause of poisoning, are usually unintentional, and rarely result in severe manifestations. OVERDOSE:  Little data are available. Significant poisonings result in symptoms similar to those observed with typical NSAIDs, such as GI upset, vomiting, abdominal pain. Rarely, hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, and coma may occur. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: GI effects occur most commonly and include dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, and flatulence. Other fairly common findings include headache and fever. SEVERE: Celecoxib is rarely associated with cardiac or renal events. GI bleeding may occur with chronic use. Methemoglobinemia is a rare event. Rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2004, due to an increased risk of severe dysrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest and sudden death), renal events, and associated with aseptic meningitis.<br\/>"},{"id":"jtm8s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>COX-2 INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most exposures are mild and require only supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Support respiratory and cardiovascular function as needed. GI hemorrhage is a possibility and can be managed supportively with standard treatment measures.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Generally no decontamination is needed. HOSPITAL: Overdose is unlikely to cause severe intoxication, so activated charcoal is likely unnecessary. It can be used for worrisome coingestants.<\/li><li>Airway management: Provide supportive care as this is not likely to be an issue.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote available.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function and urinalysis after significant overdose. Obtain acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations, if there is any uncertainty of the drug ingested or if the overdose was intentional. Laboratory studies are generally unnecessary, since COX-2 overdose patients manifest mild signs and symptoms. Specific drug concentrations are not helpful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for hemodialysis given the high degree of protein binding and very large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with unintentional ingestions may be observed at home if asymptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients with uncontrollable nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. Once a patient is asymptomatic for 6 hours, they may be discharged. Patients with a deliberate self-harm attempt should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients requiring ongoing supportive care may need to be admitted. Once a patient is asymptomatic for 6 hours, they may be discharged. CONSULT CRITERIA: Severe poisoning does not usually occur with COX-2 inhibitors.
