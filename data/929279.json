Antidepressants increased the risk compared with placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults beyond age 24 years, and there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults aged 65 or older. This risk must be balanced with clinical need. Monitor patients closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior.

PHARMACOLOGY: Inhibits neuronal norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake; thus potentiating the serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS. TOXICOLOGY: Primarily sympathomimetic activity, potential for serotonin syndrome. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Several deliberate poisonings with milnacipran have been reported in postmarketing experience. Fatalities are rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Somnolence, nausea and vomiting are common. Tachycardia and hypertension have been reported. SEVERE TOXICITY: Milnacipran may cause seizures and serotonin syndrome.  Acute stress cardiomyopathy developed in a woman after ingesting 3000 mg of milnacipran. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Headache, nausea and vomiting, constipation, hypertension, tachycardia and palpitations. Elevated liver enzymes have been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"929279-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MILNACIPRAN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. For severe hypotension, administer intravenous fluids and vasopressors. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital activated charcoal is not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and rarely, seizures. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a potentially toxic ingestion who is able to maintain airway or if airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation may be necessary if significant CNS depression or severe serotonin syndrome develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Sedate with benzodiazepines. Consider cyproheptadine in patients with more severe manifestations who are able to take oral medications: ADULT: 12 mg orally initially, then 2 mg every 2 hours if manifestations persist (maximum 32 mg in 24 hours), maintenance dose 8 mg every 6 hours. CHILDREN: 0.25 mg\/kg\/day divided every 6 hours, maximum 12 mg\/day. If hyperthermic control agitation\/rigidity (benzodiazepines) and initiate external cooling measures (undress patient, cover with wet sheet and direct fan at skin). In severe cases, neuromuscular blockade (non-depolarizing agents) may be necessary. Treat hypotension with intravenous 0.9% saline, if pressors are necessary direct acting (norepinephrine, phentolamine) are preferred.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum milnacipran concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding therapy after overdose. Monitor vital signs, serum electrolytes, and liver enzyme levels in symptomatic patients. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in symptomatic patients. Monitor neurologic exam for evidence of mental status depression or serotonin syndrome.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to the fairly large volume of distribution of milnacipran, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are NOT likely to be beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility.
