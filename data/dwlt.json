It is the drug of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA) and multiply resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Oral vancomycin therapy is indicated for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and enterocolitis associated with Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains. PHARMACOLOGY: Vancomycin inhibits cell wall synthesis, most likely by interference with glycopeptide polymerization. TOXICOLOGY: The mechanism by which vancomycin causes nephrotoxicity is unclear. \"Red man syndrome\" is an anaphylactoid reaction in which mast cells and basophils undergo degranulation and release histamine. A direct myocardial depressant effect is seen in animal studies. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Vancomycin overdose is rare and serious toxicity is uncommon. OVERDOSE: Hypotension, bradycardia, flushing, and apnea have been described in neonates. Nephrotoxicity can occur after excessive doses of these agents. Reversible ototoxicity has occurred with excessive serum concentrations. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nephrotoxicity is an infrequent adverse effect and is more likely to occur when combined with aminoglycosides, though reversible nephrotoxicity has occurred with excessive serum concentrations. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, phlebitis, severe lacrimation, conjunctivitis, fever, and chills have occurred with therapeutic use. Pruritus and various rashes, erythema multiforme, and exfoliative dermatitis are seen infrequently with therapeutic doses. Most cases of permanent hearing loss have been associated with the coadministration of an aminoglycoside.  Severe adverse effects include hypotension and cardiac arrest, which have been associated with rapid intravenous administration. Red man syndrome (RMS), which includes the following collection of signs\/symptoms: sudden and profound decreases in blood pressure, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the upper body (red man), pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back has been described following therapeutic use.  It most often occurs with rapid intravenous infusion.  Reactions generally resolve within 20 minutes, but may persist for several hours. <br\/>"},{"id":"dwlts12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VANCOMYCIN AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Red Man Syndrome: Antihistamines can be used as pretreatment. Increasing the dilution of vancomycin and slowing the rate intravenous administration may also help.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Vancomycin is poorly absorbed orally and toxicity from ingestion is unlikely. Gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated unless coingestants are involved. OCULAR EXPOSURE: Irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia persist, the patient should be seen in a healthcare facility. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Remove decontaminated clothing and wash exposed area extremely thoroughly with soap and water. Seek healthcare if irritation and pain persist after washing. HOSPITAL: Vancomycin is poorly absorbed orally; gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Enhanced elimination is generally only necessary in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Hemoperfusion, hemofiltration, high-flux hemodialysis, and hemodiafiltration have been effective in reducing serum vancomycin concentrations when high-porosity hemofilters are used. Multiple dose activated charcoal (MDAC): May decrease the half-life of intravenously administered vancomycin, but has not been shown to affect outcome. It is not routinely recommended but can be considered for patients with large overdoses when the patient is expected to have prolonged clearance, if the potential benefits are felt to outweigh risks. MDAC should not be administered in patients who are at risk for the abrupt onset of seizures or mental status depression or who are not able to protect airway.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Monitor renal function, serum electrolytes, CBC, urine output, and serum vancomycin concentrations after an overdose. Auditory function may also require monitoring. Therapeutic concentrations: Peak: 25 to 35 mcg\/mL, trough: 10 to 15 mcg\/mL.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with inadvertent oral overdose who are asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Most overdoses are iatrogenic errors of intravenously administered vancomycin and these patients should be monitored. Any patient with a deliberate oral overdose or with symptoms after oral overdose should be referred to a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All symptomatic patients should be admitted to the hospital.
