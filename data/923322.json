and selectivity for the AT(1) receptor.   Losartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by inhibiting the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor.   AT 1 receptor blockade results in an increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) followed by increases in plasma angiotensin II concentration.   The potential clinical consequences of these increases are not clear.   Angiotensin II agonist effects have not been demonstrated. <\/li><li>Hydrochlorothiazide-Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic.   Thiazide diuretics increase urinary excretion of sodium and water by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the early distal tubule.   The diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide decreases plasma volume, resulting in increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium.   Since the renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, coadministration of losartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with hydrochlorothiazide. <\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923322-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"923322-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Losartan- Well-absorbed;<\/li><li>Bioavailability: 33%<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"923322-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Losartan- Hepatic: first pass; Active metabolite: carboxylic acid metabolite<\/li><li>Hydrochlorothiazide- not metabolized<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"923322-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Losartan- Fecal: 60%; Renal: 35%, 4% unchanged and 6% active metabolite<\/li><li>Hydrochlorothiazide: Renal<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"923322-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Losartan: 2 hr<\/li><li>Hydrochlorothiazide: 5.6 to 14.8 hr<\/li><\/ul>"}}},{"id":"923322-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>may be administered with or without food <br\/>"},{"id":"923322-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>blood pressure<\/li><li>renal function<\/li><li>serum electrolytes periodically<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923322-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: (Hydrochlorothiazide - Losartan Potassium) 12.5 MG-50 MG, 12.5 MG-100 MG, 25 MG-100 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Hyzaar<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: (Hydrochlorothiazide - Losartan Potassium) 12.5 MG-50 MG, 12.5 MG-100 MG, 25 MG-100 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923322-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"923322-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANGIOTENSIN II ANTAGONISTS<\/b><br\/>USES: Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are used for the treatment of hypertension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are common, but toxicity is rare and deaths have not been reported following single-substance exposures. PHARMACOLOGY: Angiotensin II is an endogenous peptide that binds to angiotensin receptors, causing vasoconstriction and stimulation of aldosterone release. Angiotensin receptor blockers are competitive antagonists at these receptors. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive antagonism of angiotensin receptors causes vasodilation and hypotension. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild hypotension and tachycardia, hypokalemia, asymptomatic hypoglycemia, muscle cramps and dizziness have been reported. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity has not been observed with these agents. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Common adverse effects include hypotension and dizziness. Angioedema has been reported rarely.<br\/><\/li><li><b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/>USES: Class of drugs that are primarily used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Potassium sparing diuretics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Work in a variety of mechanisms including inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (thiazides), inhibiting transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle (loop), and osmotic agents (mannitol). TOXICOLOGY: Produce hypovolemia and electrolyte deficiencies. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Rare overdose which uncommonly results in significant morbidity or death. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild dehydration, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, headache, muscle cramps, thirst, and brisk diuresis. Large doses of furosemide or ethacrynic acid can cause ototoxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, mental status changes, and electrolyte abnormalities (i.e. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia) are the most common manifestations of severe poisoning. Rarely muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, coma, or dysrhythmias may develop secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities.  CNS depression has been reported rarely in children with acute ingestion without significant electrolyte abnormalities. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Thiazides are associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Furosemide has been associated with ototoxicity, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  Diuretics have a large number of drug interactions as well.
