Chronic fluoride poisoning (fluorosis) may occur in areas where the water has very high fluoride concentrations. Fluoride-liberating chemicals (such as ammonium fluoride, ammonium bifluoride, and sodium fluorosilicate) are used in some automobile wheel cleaners and rust removers. Sodium fluoride was used as a rodenticide. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used in etching glass and cleaning silicon chip products. Ammonium bifluoride and hydrofluoric acid are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Fluoride promotes remineralization of decalcified dental enamel and may interfere with the growth of bacteria in dental plaque. TOXICOLOGY: Sodium fluoride reacts with the gastric acid to form hydrofluoric acid. The major toxic effects of fluoride are due to the chelation of calcium and magnesium. In tissue, the local hypocalcemia causes pain and cellular death. Systemic hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia may cause cardiac dysrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse. Fluoride opens the calcium-dependent potassium channels on erythrocytes resulting in hyperkalemia. Fluoride also impairs oxidative phosphorylation. Long-term ingestion of water with high fluoride concentrations results in weak and brittle bones (fluorosis). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Dermal exposures are common. Systemic fluoride poisoning is uncommon, but deaths are reported to poison centers each year, primarily from exposure to hydrofluoric acid. Toxicity is very rare following exposure to household dental products (toothpaste and dental rinses), but is theoretically possible following ingestion of fluoride supplements. Fluorosis is common in some areas of Asia due to high fluoride content of water. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Acute ingestion of dental products containing sodium fluoride generally causes minor gastrointestinal upset. Skin exposure to household products with higher concentrations of fluoride ion results in pain that develops slowly. The tissue may appear normal but the patient can have severe pain. Over time the skin may become hyperemic with subsequent blanching and cogitative necrosis. Eye exposure can cause irritation and corneal edema; if fluoride concentration is higher, conjunctival ischemia and chemosis may develop. Inhalation causes minor upper respiratory tract irritation. Nausea and vomiting frequently occurs within 30 to 60 minutes of ingestion. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity generally only develops after exposure to industrial products containing fairly high concentrations of sodium fluoride or sodium bifluoride. Severe burns (ocular and dermal) may occur following exposure to higher concentration products. Burns involving more than 5% body surface area (BSA) from low concentration products or more than 1% BSA from high concentration products may produce systemic fluoride poisoning. Systemic toxicity most commonly occurs following ingestion, but may occur following dermal or inhalational exposure. Inhalation may cause acute lung injury from direct tissue injury. Symptoms of serious toxicity include skeletal muscle weakness and spasm, respiratory muscle weakness, and respiratory arrest. Ventricular dysrhythmias and fibrillation are thought to be the main cause of death. Patients may have severe toxicity without significant oral or gastrointestinal symptoms. <br\/>"},{"id":"556160-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FLUORIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most patients with dermal exposure will do well if irrigated immediately. There is no evidence that any products are more effective than water. Patients with ophthalmic exposure should have each eye irrigated with 1 L of normal saline, LR or water. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Early administration of high doses of calcium salts and magnesium may be life-saving. Administer sufficient calcium to maintain serum concentrations in the high-normal range.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Decontamination generally is not required after inadvertent ingestion of a dental product. Administer a calcium-containing antacid. DILUTION: Administer milk (preferred) or water (1 or 2 glassfuls) to dilute the corrosive fluoride salt in the oropharynx, esophagus, and stomach. Milk provides calcium ions which may bind to fluoride ions and decrease their penetrability and systemic absorption. HOSPITAL: Administer a calcium-containing antacid. Consider gastric aspiration for large recent ingestion of a high concentration fluoride salt. Activated charcoal does not adsorb fluoride.<\/li><li>Antidote: DERMAL EXPOSURE: Patients should be treated in a stepwise manner based on their response to therapy. The initial treatment for pain from dermal exposure is topical calcium. One method for making a gel is to mix calcium gluconate with methylcellulose or water-soluble lubricant in a 1:2 ratio. Apply the gel to the affected areas as frequently as needed to relieve symptoms. If the patient has pain despite topical therapy, extremity burns can be treated with a regional infusion of 40 mL of 2.5% calcium gluconate solution using a Bier block. If this is not successful, an intra-arterial infusion of 40 mL of 2.5% calcium gluconate can be performed. If the area affected is not on an extremity, inject 0.3 to 0.5 mL\/cm(2) of 2.5% calcium gluconate into the region. SYSTEMIC POISONING: Very high doses of calcium may be required. If there is a known large exposure, administer 1 to 2 g of calcium chloride (3 to 6 g of calcium gluconate) while awaiting the initial serum calcium determination. Administer additional calcium to maintain the serum calcium concentration in the high-normal range. Monitor the serum calcium every 15 minutes for several hours. If the patient develops dysrhythmias or hypotension, give an additional 1 to 2 g of calcium chloride (3 to 6 g of calcium gluconate). Hypomagnesemia should be treated with magnesium sulfate, 1 to 2 g given over 10 to 15 minutes (children: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to less than 10 mg\/mL). Treat hyperkalemia with intravenous calcium and other usual measurements. Systemic alkalinization (to a pH of 7.45 to 7.5) improves survival in animal models of fluoride poisoning and should be considered in cases of life-threatening toxicity.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No testing is required for minor skin exposures. If there is concern for systemic poisoning, the serum electrolytes including calcium and magnesium, and renal function should be monitored. An ECG should be obtained and continuous cardiac monitoring instituted. If there is a potentially large exposure, the serum calcium should be monitored every 15 minutes for 4 to 6 hours.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Fluoride is removed by dialysis; however, patients with significant toxicity are usually too ill to tolerate dialysis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Children with inadvertent ingestions of low fluoride concentration dental products can be managed at home if the ingestion is 8 mg\/kg fluoride (17.7 mg\/kg sodium fluoride) or less and the child does not have symptoms beyond minor gastrointestinal upset. To calculate the amount of fluoride ion ingested, use the following equations based on the type of fluoride in the product ingested: SODIUM FLUORIDE: (Concentration in %)(Amount ingested in oz)(Constant=128)\/Patient weight in kg= mg\/kg ingested; SODIUM MONOFLUOROPHOSPHATE: (Concentration in %)(Amount ingested in oz)(Constant=37)\/Patient weight in kg= mg\/kg ingested; FLUORIDE ION (w\/v%): (Concentration in %)(Amount ingested in oz)(Constant=218)\/Patient weight in kg= mg\/kg ingested (Derivations of all constants are explained in the Range of Toxicity\/Calculations section). OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All ingestion and inhalation exposures to higher concentration or industrial products, and all deliberate ingestions should be considered potentially fatal and should be referred to a healthcare facility and observed for a minimum of 6 hours. Patients with skin burn greater than 5% body surface area (BSA) from low concentration products or more than 1% BSA from high concentration products should be observed for systemic effects. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant burns and those who require intra-arterial calcium require admission. Patients with systemic toxicity or ECG changes should be admitted to an ICU setting.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"556160-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>FLUORIDE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Vomiting and abdominal pain are common with ingestions of 3 to 5 mg\/kg of elemental fluoride.

Intractable ventricular fibrillation has been reported in lethal cases. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ADULTS: The average daily dietary fluoride intake ranges from 0.5 to 5 mg as the anion.
