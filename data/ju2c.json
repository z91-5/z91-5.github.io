MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment.  In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain, spinal and hepatic tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoversetamide shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. At the recommended dose, the effect is primarily on T1 relaxation time, and produces an increase in signal intensity (brightness). Gadoversetamide does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that may have a normal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoversetamide in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"ju2cs8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"ju2cs8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 162  plus or minus  25 mL\/kg <br\/>"},"2":{"id":"ju2cs8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Not been detected <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"ju2cs8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Renal: 96% <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"ju2cs8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 103.6  plus or minus  19.5 min <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"ju2cs9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>do not mix with or administer via the same IV line with concurrent drugs or parenteral nutrition.<\/li><li>multi-dose bulk vial: NOT for direct infusion; draw the desired dose from the multi-dose vial into an empty sterile syringe using an appropriate transfer device<\/li><li>do not exceed the recommended dose<\/li><li>administer at a rate of 1 to 2 mL\/sec via manual or by power injection<\/li><li>allow sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to readministering; 95.5% +\/- 17.4% of a 0.1 mmol\/kg dose is eliminated in the urine by 24 hours<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"ju2cs10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>renal function prior to drug administration<\/li><li>lab testing for estimated GFR; patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function  (eg, patients with hypertension or diabetes, and in patients older than 60 years)<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)<\/li><li>observation for hypersensitivity reaction during and for several hours after drug administration; patients with history of allergy, renal insufficiency, or drug reaction<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"ju2cs11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Optimark<\/b><br\/>Injection Injectable: 330.9 MG\/ML<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"ju2cs13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Drug may cause headache, dizziness, injection site reactions, and flushing.<\/li><li>Drug may cause rhinitis, nausea and vomiting, rash, and taste perversion.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (burning, itching, swelling, scaling, hardening and tightening of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; muscle weakness; pain in hips or ribs; and joint stiffness).<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
