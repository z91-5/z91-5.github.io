PHARMACOLOGY: Icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from fish oil. Studies indicate that EPA, the active metabolite of icosapent ethyl, reduces the synthesis and\/or secretion of hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides, which increases triglyceride clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased beta-oxidation, acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) inhibition, decreased hepatic lipogenesis, and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose has not been reported. OVERDOSE: Toxicity following overdose has not been reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Arthralgia. Icosapent ethyl may produce a hypersensitivity reaction in individuals with known hypersensitivity to shellfish\/fish. Because icosapent ethyl contains ethyl esters of omega-3 fatty acid, patients tanking other anticoagulants may be at risk to develop a prolonged bleeding time; the risk of active bleeding is unknown. <br\/>"},{"id":"930265-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ICOSAPENT ETHYL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION: Treat with antihistamines, inhaled beta agonists, and corticosteroids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION: Administer oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids in cases of severe hypersensitivity reaction.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely required following a minor exposure.

Consider activated charcoal if more toxic coingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support is unlikely to be necessary unless severe allergic reaction develops.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Treat with antihistamines, may also need inhaled beta agonists, and corticosteroids. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Bleeding: POTENTIAL RISK: Icosapent ethyl contains the ethyl esters of omega-3 fatty acids obtained from fish oil, which theoretically may increase bleeding time, particularly in patients taking other anticoagulants. The risk of active bleeding with icosapent ethyl exposure is unknown. Coagulation studies should be obtained in a patient showing any evidence of bleeding.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific lab work (CBC, electrolytes, urinalysis) is needed unless otherwise clinically indicated. Toxic levels of icosapent ethyl have not been established; routine drug plasma levels are not likely to be available.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic, can be managed at home. An asymptomatic child with a small, inadvertent exposure (a few pills) can be monitored at home, if a responsible adult is present. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating persistent hypersensitivity or allergic symptoms should be admitted.
