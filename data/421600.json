Balsalazide is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Olsalazine is used to maintain remission of ulcerative colitis in patients who are intolerant of sulfasalazine. PHARMACOLOGY: Mesalamine, also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, is classified as an anti-inflammatory drug.  In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites is increased both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways.  Mesalamine appears to reduce inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, thereby decreasing the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Both balsalazide and olsalazine are converted to mesalamine in the colon. Each daily dose (6.75 grams\/day) of balsalazide is equivalent to 2.4 grams of mesalamine. Olsalazine 1 g is converted to more than 0.9 g of mesalamine in the colon. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: There is limited experience with overdose.  Effects of overdose may be similar to salicylate toxicity:  tinnitus, vertigo, headache, confusion, drowsiness, sweating, seizures, hyperventilation, dyspnea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Disruption of electrolyte balance and blood-pH, hyperthermia, dehydration, and end organ damage may occur with severe intoxication. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, and headache. OTHER EFFECTS: Rash, pruritus, urticaria skin eruption, dyspepsia, tinnitus, and elevated liver enzymes. RARE: Pericardial effusion, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, pericarditis, myocarditis, alopecia, pancreatitis, renal impairment including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, blood dyscrasias (eg, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia, eosinophilia, leukopenia), hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, arthralgia, depression, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, vertigo, asthenia, paresthesia, respiratory distress, and pneumonia.<br\/>"},{"id":"421600-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MESALAMINE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat hypotension with IV fluids and pressors (norepinephrine preferred) if needed. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is not recommended, because of the possibility of CNS depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions (rare) or pulmonary toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes after significant overdose. Obtain baseline ECG in symptomatic patients and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Patients exhibiting symptoms of respiratory distress should be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry and a chest radiograph.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: At the time of this review, there is no information regarding the effectiveness of  hemodialysis following mesalamine overdose. Mesalamine has a protein binding of 43% and a volume of distribution of 0.2 L\/kg. Theoretically, hemodialysis would be effective in clearing mesalamine.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic, can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Peak concentrations of delayed-release formulations are expected to be delayed after overdose. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged.  ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"421600-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MESALAMINE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
