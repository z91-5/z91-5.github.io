This class includes etravirine, delavirdine mesylate, efavirenz, nevirapine, and rilpivirine. PHARMACOLOGY: NNRTIs bind adjacent to the active site of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, causing conformational change and thus inactivation of the enzyme. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicological effects are generally extensions of adverse effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon, and severe sequelae from acute overdose is rare. Adverse effects and drug interactions, however, are common. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The majority of patients will have minimal or no symptoms following overdose. Mild transaminitis may occur in the setting of overdose. Psychiatric disturbances characterized by mania, agitation, and sometimes somnolence have been observed in overdose. Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting have been reported. Transient mild neutropenia and hyperlactemia developed in an infant after intravenous overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Headache, dizziness, transaminitis, rash, nausea, vomiting,  diarrhea, paresthesias, psychiatric disturbances, and hyperlipidemia are the most commonly reported adverse effects. Other adverse effects specific to each drug include: DELAVIRDINE: rash (36%), hepatitis (rare), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare), neutropenia (rare). EFAVIRENZ: headache, dizziness, impaired concentration, abnormal dreams, or other CNS\/psychiatric disturbances (52%), rash (27%), transaminitis, fever, hyperlipidemia. ETRAVIRINE: rash, peripheral neuropathy, toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare), hepatitis (rare). NEVIRAPINE: rash (7%), pruritus, hepatitis (1%), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (0.3%), fever. Hypersensitivity syndrome (HHS) has been described approximately 4 weeks following the therapeutic use of nevirapine.  Generalized maculopapular rash, eosinophilia, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly developed. DRUG INTERACTIONS: DELAVIRDINE: A CYP3A4 substrate and inhibitor and a CYP2C9 inhibitor; carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin, and phenytoin may decrease delavirdine concentrations; may increase plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 substrates. EFAVIRENZ: A CYP3A4 substrate and inducer, and a CYP2B6 substrate; may decrease phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and methadone concentrations; may cause false positive tetrahydrocannabinol tests. ETRAVIRINE: A CYP3A4 substrate and inducer, a CYP2C9 substrate and inhibitor, and a CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor; may increase the INR when administered with warfarin; may decrease etravirine concentrations when administered with phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital; may increase digoxin concentrations. NEVIRAPINE: A CYP3A4 substrate and inducer, and a CYP2B6 substrate; may cause methadone withdrawal; may decrease plasma concentrations of oral contraceptives; may decrease ketoconazole concentrations; administration with rifampin may decrease nevirapine concentrations.<br\/>"},{"id":"jt55s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AIDS ANTIVIRAL NON-NUCLEOSIDES<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Supportive care remains the mainstay of care. Benzodiazepines or antipsychotics may be used for agitation or manic symptoms. Mild transaminitis can be monitored and no specific treatment is indicated. Nausea and vomiting should be treated with antiemetics. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care is the mainstay of care in severe toxicity. Withdrawal of the offending agent is imperative to improvement in severe adverse reactions. Stevens-Johnson syndrome should be treated with supportive care and consideration of corticosteroid and IV immunoglobulin therapy. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) should be considered for neutropenia complicated by infection felt to be secondary to nevirapine. Hepatic failure should prompt consultation with a transplant center.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: No prehospital decontamination is indicated. Prehospital care should focus on assessment of vital signs and general supportive care. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered for patients that present early after overdose if they are awake, alert, and willing to drink the charcoal. Gastric lavage has no role in the management of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) overdose.<\/li><li>Airway management: Respiratory depression is not expected with overdose of NNRTIs. However coingestants must be considered and airway protection should be employed as needed for airway protection.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote for NNRTI toxicity.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Measurement of a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and liver enzymes should be performed in cases where adverse effects or overdose are suspected. Right upper quadrant ultrasound should be considered to evaluate for alternative etiologies of transaminitis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and whole bowel irrigation have no role in the management of NNRTI overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Suicidal patients should be referred to a health care facility. Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent ingestions of NNRTIs can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours, primarily monitoring signs of coingestant toxicity. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe toxicity should be admitted. Patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or hepatic failure should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Infectious disease should be consulted if a change to anti-retroviral therapy is indicated.

ADULT: Psychomotor agitation developed after 15.6 grams and 54 grams efavirenz in adults. PEDIATRIC: An ingestion of 200 mg of nevirapine (40 times the recommended dose of 2 mg\/kg\/day) instead of the prescribed 200 mg of nelfinavir in an 8-day-old infant resulted in mild transient neutropenia and hyperlactatemia.
