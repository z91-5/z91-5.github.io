PHARMACOLOGY: Antagonist of H2 histamine receptors. This effect decreases gastric acid secretion. TOXICOLOGY: Cimetidine inhibits the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes, 1A2, C219, and 2D6, and decreases the metabolism of many other medications. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures to H2 blockers are common, but significant toxicity has not been described. Adverse effects during therapeutic use are rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild drowsiness, dizziness or confusion. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is exceedingly rare. CNS depression and hypotension have been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Dry mouth, delirium, and bone marrow suppression have been reported. Bradycardia and conduction effects are rare effects occurring mostly after rapid IV administration.<br\/><\/li><li><b>IBUPROFEN <\/b><br\/>USES: Ibuprofen is used for fever and pain control and for the treatment of several rheumatologic conditions. PHARMACOLOGY: Ibuprofen inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme, leading to decreased prostaglandin production and decreased pain and inflammation. TOXICOLOGY: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are due to both local irritant effects and the inhibition of prostaglandins (PG), which are responsible in part for maintaining the GI mucosal barrier. Inhibition of thromboxane A2 production in platelets prolongs bleeding time and contributes to gastrointestinal bleeding. Inhibition of PGI2 and PGE2, which have vasodilatory and natriuretic activity in the kidney, can be linked to sodium and water retention and occasional acute renal failure. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is common; however, severe toxicity is very rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In general, patients are asymptomatic or have mild GI upset (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain). Mild CNS depression (drowsiness, lethargy) and headache are common (incidence up to 30%). Nystagmus, diplopia, headache, tinnitus, and transient deafness may also occur following overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: With massive overdose, seizure, coma, acute renal failure, and, very rarely, cardiopulmonary arrest may occur. Upper GI bleeding may occur after acute or chronic ingestion. Elevated liver enzymes, hypoprothrombinemia, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia (associated with renal failure), hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, dyspnea, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation have also been observed in overdose. Transient episodes of apnea have been reported in young children following large ingestions. Acute pancreatitis has been reported. ONSET: Symptoms typically occur within 4 to 6 hours of ingestion. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Gastrointestinal distress, nausea, and epigastric pain are the most common findings; upper GI bleeding may occur after acute or chronic ingestion. Angioedema, hives, itching, rash, and swelling have also been reported with therapeutic use. Fluid retention, interstitial nephritis, nephritic syndrome, and acute renal failure can develop. Hematologic effects include agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Headache, asthma exacerbation, aseptic meningitis, delirium, and anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxi6s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>CIMETIDINE AND RELATED DRUGS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
