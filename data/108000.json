PHARMACOLOGY: Levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, has the capacity to cross the blood brain barrier thus providing dopamine to the corpus striatum. Carbidopa is an inhibitor of aromatic acid decarboxylation which prevents the rapid decarboxylation of levodopa in extracerebral tissues making more levodopa available for transport to the brain. TOXICOLOGY: Cardiovascular and CNS effects are probably due to levodopa's immediate metabolite dopamine.  This compound at low serum levels causes hypotension and tachycardia due to stimulation of the dopaminergic and beta receptors. At higher levels alpha receptor stimulation overrides and hypertension is the result.  Dysrhythmias may occur due to stimulation of beta receptors in the heart. CNS effects due to excessive dopamine may be expected to include dyskinesias.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: The most common signs\/symptoms seen following acute overdose include confusion, agitation, diaphoresis, insomnia, anxiety, and excessive motor activity.  Other effects reported after acute overdose have included nausea, vomiting, sinus tachycardia, postural hypotension, restlessness, hypertension, dyskinesias, confusion, delirium, hallucinations, psychosis, xerostomia, urinary retention, mydriasis, increased CK, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and respiratory dyskinesias. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, dyskinesia (eg, choreiform, dystonia, facial tics, grimacing, head bobbing, torticollis, and choreoathetosis). OTHER EFFECTS: Anorexia, vomiting, somnolence, agitation, diaphoresis, insomnia, anxiety, confusion, postural hypotension, dizziness, hypertension, rash, delirium, hallucinations, psychosis, respiratory dyskinesias, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. A constellation of symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been described following withdrawal of levodopa\/carbidopa. Symptoms reported include fever or hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes, autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, and hyper- or hypotension. <br\/>"},{"id":"108000-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LEVODOPA\/CARBIDOPA <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. Control agitation and confusion with benzodiazepines. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat agitation with benzodiazepines. Treat dystonias and dyskinetic movements with diazepam, diphenhydramine, or benztropine. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. Treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome with benzodiazepines, bromocriptine, consider dantrolene, as well as cooling and supportive measures.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended.

ADULT: Benztropine is dosed at 1 to 4 mg IV or IM, maximum 6 mg\/day. Diphenhydramine is dosed at 25 to 50 mg IV over 2 minutes. PEDIATRIC: Diphenhydramine: 1.25 mg\/kg\/dose IV over 2 minutes.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension does not usually require treatment.

Monitor vital signs and mental status following significant overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients and those with deliberate ingestions should be sent to a medical facility for evaluation and treatment. Peak concentrations of sustained-release formulation is reached 2 hours after ingestion as compared with 0.5 hours after an immediate-release formulation. Patients that have ingested a sustained-release product have the potential to manifest symptoms in a delayed\/prolonged fashion and should be observed for 4 to 8 hours.
