Arsenic trioxide is the primary material used to produce all arsenical compounds, and is used as an intermediate for insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, as a wood preservative, a decoloring and refining agent in the manufacture of glass, and a textile mordant. It is also used in pharmaceutical preparations, pigments, and in sheep and cattle dip for preserving hides. PHARMACOLOGY: The precise mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remains to be clearly defined. However, in vitro studies indicated that morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis occur in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells following arsenic trioxide administration. Selective apoptosis of APL cells mediated by activation of cysteine-proteases (caspases) may be involved. Additionally, arsenic trioxide induces damage and degradation of the fusion protein PML\/RAR-alpha. TOXICOLOGY: Trivalent arsenic (As3+) disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, leading to free radical formation via inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which subsequently decreases gluconeogenesis due to lack of acetyl-CoA. Chronically, arsenic may cause DNA damage, mutation in the p-53 suppressor gene, and inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms leading to cancer. EPIDEMIOLOGY: INTRAVENOUS ROUTE: Overdose is rare. OTHER ROUTES: Toxicity from arsenic is uncommon and major effects are rare. INTRAVENOUS ROUTE: Data is limited. Seizures, muscle weakness, confusion may occur; other effects are similar to exposure by other routes (see below). OTHER ROUTES: ACUTE OVERDOSE: Arsenic compounds are mainly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, but some absorption may occur through intact skin or inhalation. Acute arsenic ingestion generally produces signs and symptoms within 30 minutes but symptoms may be delayed for several hours if ingested with food. Many arsenic compounds are severe irritants of the skin, eye, and mucous membranes; some may be corrosive. Contact produces local hyperemia, followed by vesicular or pustular eruptions. Trivalent compounds are particularly caustic. Acute inhalation exposures have resulted in irritation of the upper respiratory tract. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Gastrointestinal symptoms occur rapidly after acute ingestion. Initial signs and symptoms include burning lips, throat constriction, and dysphagia. Excruciating abdominal pain, severe nausea, vomiting, and profuse \"rice water-like\" diarrhea that may lead to hypovolemia follows these symptoms. In addition, hypovolemia from capillary leakage (third-spacing of fluids) is a common early effect. QTc prolongation may occur. Muscle cramps, facial edema, bronchitis, dyspnea, chest pain, dehydration, intense thirst, and fluid-electrolyte disturbances are also common following significant exposures. A garlic-like odor of the breath and feces may also develop. Subacute toxicity can produce neuropathies, both motor and sensory, and can progress to a Guillain-Barre like syndrome. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension and tachycardia are common early signs of severe poisoning. Hypotension may be resistant to fluid resuscitation and multi-organ failure may ensue. Fever and tachypnea may occur. These patients can develop ventricular dysrhythmias including torsade de pointes. Encephalopathy, seizures and coma have been reported. Acute renal failure, hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatitis may occur several days after ingestion. CHRONIC TOXICITY: Inhalation is the most common route of exposure in arsenic workers. The sequence of chronic poisoning involves weakness, anorexia, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and gastrointestinal complaints, followed by conjunctivitis, irritation of the upper respiratory tract, hyperpigmentation, and eczematoid and allergic dermatitis. A hoarse voice and chronic upper respiratory septum is a common result after prolonged inhalation of white arsenic dust or fume. Peripheral nervous system symptoms may include numbness, burning, and tingling of the hands and feet; pain; paresthesias; tenderness; muscle fasciculations; gross tremors; ataxia; discoloration; and mental confusion. Muscular weakness, limb tenderness and difficulty walking may follow. The final phase consists of peripheral sensory neuropathy of the hands and feet. Associated motor neuropathy may occur as well. Certain arsenic compounds are known human carcinogens. Chronic exposure in either occupational settings or by drinking contaminated groundwater can cause poisoning and carries an increased risk of skin, lung, bladder, and possibly liver cancers. ADVERSE EFFECTS: INTRAVENOUS ROUTE: COMMON (greater than 20%): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, edema, rigors, chest pain, injection site pain, sore throat, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, elevated liver enzymes, headache, insomnia, paresthesia, dizziness, cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, hypoxia, pleural effusion, dermatitis, pruritus, ecchymosis, tachycardia, hypotension, sinusitis, arthralgia, myalgia, bone pain, leukocytosis, anemia, anxiety. OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS: Palmar keratosis, rashes, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, neutropenia, noncirrhotic portal hypertension, hypersensitivity reaction, tremor, peripheral neuropathy, seizure, coma, and acidosis. Patients receiving arsenic trioxide may develop QT interval prolongation, complete atrioventricular block, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), ventricular tachycardia, and a potentially fatal torsade de pointes ventricular dysrhythmia. Retinoic acid syndrome (retinoic-acid-Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, RA-APL, or APL differentiation syndrome), a serious adverse effect, may also occur. It is characterized by fever, skin rash, lower leg edema, weight gain, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leukocytosis and death. <br\/>"},{"id":"922444-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ARSENIC TRIOXIDE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Fluid resuscitation should be initiated immediately, but care must be taken to recognize pulmonary and cerebral edema when present. When a significant acute ingestion or intravenous overdose is confirmed, chelation therapy should be initiated immediately prior to laboratory confirmation. This will minimize time delay to treatment associated with prolonged laboratory result turn around. In chronic toxicity, the decision to chelate must be based upon patient condition and laboratory evaluation. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Aggressive life support measures should be instituted immediately. Anti-arrhythmic medications that prolong the QTc should be avoided. In severely ill patients, combined therapy with both BAL and an oral agent should be considered. If renal failure exists, the dose of BAL should be decreased after the loading dose. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. INHALATION EXPOSURE: Inhalation is the most common exposure in arsenic workers. Initial treatment should be to remove the patient from the exposure and refer the patient to an occupational specialist for 24-hour urine collection. The decision to chelate will depend upon the patient's clinical status and urine arsenic concentration. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Occasionally arsenic can cause a contact dermatitis or an exfoliative rash. Wash the area thoroughly and avoid further dermal contact. Topical steroid creams may decrease inflammation in these cases. EYE EXPOSURE: Copious irrigation and ophthalmology follow-up.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free 0.9% saline).  Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hr).  Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Remove the contaminated clothing and wash the patient thoroughly. HOSPITAL: ORAL ROUTE: Activated charcoal does not bind arsenic well. Gastric lavage and whole bowel irrigation should be considered for confirmed significant ingestions. INTRAVENOUS ROUTE: Decontamination is not necessary.<\/li><li>Airway management: Should be considered for patients with severe CNS depression at risk of aspiration.<\/li><li>Antidote: BAL and succimer are chelating agents used as antidotal therapy for arsenic toxicity. BAL: Symptomatic patients unable to tolerate oral medication should be treated with BAL 3 to 5 mg\/kg\/dose IM every 4 to 6 hours. The dose and frequency depend on the degree of toxicity seen. Higher doses of BAL invariably cause adverse effects. SUCCIMER: Should be used as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral medication. DOSE: 10 mg\/kg every 8 hours for 5 days, then decrease dosing to every 12 hours for 14 days. It may be more effective and causes fewer side effects than BAL. Chelation therapy should be stopped when the urinary arsenic level falls below 50 mcg per 24 hours.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Monitor CBC with differential for evidence of bone marrow suppression. If fever or infection develop during leukopenic phase, cultures should be obtained and appropriate antibiotics started. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Peripheral axonal neuropathy: Peripheral neurotoxicity should be anticipated in overdose. Monitor and treat symptoms as indicated.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring, obtain an ECG, and administer oxygen.  Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders.  Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, particularly in patients with underlying impaired cardiac function. Because arsenic can cause torsades de pointes and QTc prolongation, amiodarone should only be used with extreme caution. Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Treat with magnesium; atrial overdrive pacing may also be indicated. Correct electrolyte abnormalities.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Arsenic is poorly dialyzable. Hemodialysis should only be considered for arsenic toxicity accompanied by renal failure.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving IV arsenic trioxide. Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Monitor the patient for signs of bleeding. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, renal function tests, and a blood arsenic concentration in symptomatic patients. Arsenic testing must be correlated with the time of exposure and care must be taken to eliminate possible confounding factors such as food-derived arsenic (fish) or accumulated arsenic in those with chronic renal failure. Diagnosis is based on elevated urinary arsenic levels. A spot urine may be done as a screen prior to chelation but arsenic excretion is intermittent, therefore a 24-hour urine arsenic collection is necessary for definitive diagnosis. A 24-hour urinary arsenic collection exceeding 100 mcg is usually abnormal, even after chelation. Serial ECGs should be obtained to follow the QTc interval and continuous cardiac monitoring should be instituted in symptomatic patients. Most arsenic compounds are radio-opaque, therefore abdominal X-rays may confirm acute ingestions and guide decontamination.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: INTRAVENOUS ROUTE: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), cardiac function, and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"922444-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ARSENIC TRIOXIDE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Potentially fatal doses of arsenic trioxide have been listed as 70 to 180 mg or 1 to 2.5 mg\/kg.
