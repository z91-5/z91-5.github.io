PHARMACOLOGY: Lenalidomide is an analog of thalidomide with immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic and antineoplastic properties. In vivo, lenalidomide delays tumor growth in some nonclinical hematopoietic tumor models, including multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of certain hematopoietic cells including, multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome tumor cells in vitro, and activates T cell and natural killer (NK) cells, increases numbers of NKT cells, and inhibits proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited.  The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are expected to be similar to excessive pharmacologic effects. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Lenalidomide is associated with a significantly increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (which may be fatal) in patients with multiple myeloma. Myelosuppression (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) and its consequences have been common adverse events reported in lenalidomide studies. The median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 42 days (range, 14 to 411 days) and the median time to documented recovery was 17 days (range, 2 to 170 days). The median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 28 days (range, 8 to 290 days) and the median time to documented recovery was 22 days (range, 5 to 224 days). Other reported adverse effects include: pyrexia, edema, pulmonary complaints (cough and dyspnea), neurologic and neuropsychiatric complaints (insomnia, dizziness, neuropathy, headache, fatigue, and asthenia), gastrointestinal complaints (anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain); dermatological complaints (dry skin, rash, urticaria, pruritus), musculoskeletal complaints (arthralgia, back pain, muscle cramps, and limb pain), and laboratory abnormalities (hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia).

Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Peripheral neuropathy may develop in overdose. Monitor and treat symptoms.

Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Administer high-dose dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, promethazine or prochlorperazine), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, ondansetron, dolasetron, or granisetron), and\/or antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol); diphenhydramine may be required to prevent dystonic reactions from dopamine antagonists, phenothiazines, and antipsychotics.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Clinically evaluate patients for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Hematologic effects, such as neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia may occur following lenalidomide exposure.  Monitor CBC with differential, including platelets PT\/INR, and aPTT following an overdose. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. Monitor renal function and hepatic enzymes in patients with significant exposure. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism, including shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. <\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: In a lenalidomide pharmacokinetic study, 31% of the amount of lenalidomide in circulation at the start of the dialysis was removed during a 4-hour hemodialysis session.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of 1 or 2 extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than 1 or 2 extra dose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe neutropenia should be admitted to the hospital. Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved, along with monitoring of serum electrolytes, renal function and hepatic enzymes. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928481-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>LENALIDOMIDE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Overdose data are limited.
