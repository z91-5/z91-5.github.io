Cardiotoxicity, potentially fatal, has been associated with treatment. Presence or history of cardiovascular disease, prior or concomitant radiotherapy to the mediastinal\/pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, or concomitant use of other cardiotoxic drugs may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. Monitor cardiac function (cardiac signs\/symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) in all patients during therapy. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have a baseline LVEF below the lower limit of normal should not receive mitoXANTRONE. Monitor MS patients for cardiac function prior to each dose. Do not give additional doses if clinically significant drop in LVEF during treatment and do not administer a cumulative dose greater than 140 mg\/m(2) in MS patients. When mitoXANTRONE therapy is withdrawn, late-occurring cardiotoxicity should be evaluated on an annual basis in MS patients.

It is also used in combination with other drug therapies as an initial therapy in adults for the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), which can include myelogenous, promyelocytic, monocytic and erythroid acute leukemia. MitoXANTRONE may also be used as a therapy in patients with chronic (secondary) progressive, progressive relapsing or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for reducing neurologic disability or the reduction of clinical relapse. PHARMACOLOGY: MitoXANTRONE hydrochloride, an antineoplastic drug, is a DNA-reactive agent that intercalates into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) causing crosslinks and strand breaks in DNA through hydrogen binding. It also interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and inhibits topoisomerase II, an enzyme responsible for the repairing and uncoiling damaged DNA. TOXICOLOGY: Interferes with DNA replication in rapidly dividing cells, such as bone marrow and gastrointestinal epithelium. Cardiac toxicity may be related to free radical production. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Inadvertent iatrogenic overdose is very rare, but has occurred. OVERDOSE: Clinical events in overdose are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects. Severe myelosuppression may develop after overdose. Based on several inadvertent overdoses, patients receiving 140 to 180 mg\/m(2) as a single bolus injection died as a result of severe leukopenia with infection. Cardiotoxicity, including congestive heart failure and asymptomatic alterations in left ventricle function, has been reported. INTRATHECAL: Inadvertent intrathecal injection can be neurotoxic, and has resulted in seizures leading to coma, severe neurologic sequelae and paralysis. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Hematologic toxicity is generally the  dose-limiting toxicity. Severe myelosuppression will occur when mitoXANTRONE is used at high doses (greater than 14 mg\/m(2) x 3 days). The primary dose-limiting toxic effect of mitoXANTRONE is leukopenia which reaches a nadir by day 9 to 13 and returns to  normal by day 19 to 21.  Other adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, elevated liver enzymes, and extravasation injury. Cardiotoxicity including congestive heart failure, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, chest pain and asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction has also been reported. RARE: Anaphylactoid reactions, interstitial pneumonitis. <br\/>"},{"id":"379240-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MITOXANTRONE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. <\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Intrathecal injection has been reported with mitoXANTRONE following inadvertent injection; neuropathy and severe neurotoxicity have occurred. The following recommendations are based on experience with other antineoplastic drugs. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP per liter NS or LR) or albumin 5% have also been used for perfusion; may be useful because of high protein binding. Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary as mitoXANTRONE is administered intravenously.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect airway or if unstable dysrhythmias develop. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe allergic reactions, but this is rare.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. In patients with a mitoXANTRONE overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Extravasation injury: MitoXANTRONE is a vesicant. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Elevate the affected area. Apply ice packs for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily. Do not apply excessive cold to avoid tissue injury. Cold can cause local vasoconstriction and reduces fluid absorption. Treat site with topical dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for a minimum of 7 days and maximum of 14 days; however, if blistering develops, discontinue DMSO and review site. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable). Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function and liver enzymes. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Myelosuppression (eg, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) has been reported in patients receiving mitoXANTRONE. The primary dose-limiting toxic effect of mitoXANTRONE is leukopenia which reaches a nadir by day 9 to 13 and returns to  normal by day 19 to 21. Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Although there is no information regarding the effectiveness of hemodialysis or hemoperfusion for the removal of mitoXANTRONE from plasma, it is extensively tissue bound and these modalities are not anticipated to be useful. <\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), cardiac function, and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with overdose.
