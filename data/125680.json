Cladribine passively crosses the cell membrane and in cells with a high ratio of deoxycytidine kinase to deoxynucleotidase, it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to 2-chloro-2'-deoxy-beta-D-adenosine monophosphate (2-CdAMP). Since cladribine is resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase and there is little deoxynucleotide deaminase in lymphocytes and monocytes, the phosphorylated metabolites accumulate intracellularly. Subsequently, 2-CdAMP is converted into triphosphate deoxynucleotide (2-CdATP). Cells containing high concentrations of deoxynucleotides are unable to properly repair single-strand DNA breaks. The broken ends of DNA activate the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in NAD and ATP depletion and disruption of cellular metabolism.<br\/>"},{"id":"125680-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"125680-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Vd: 4.5 to 9 L\/kg<\/li><li>Vd, pediatrics: 305 to 368  L\/m(2)<\/li><li>Protein binding: 20%<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"125680-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>metabolism: unknown<\/li><li>Metabolites: 2-chloro-2'-deoxy-beta-D-adenosine monophosphate (2-CdAMP); triphosphate deoxynucleotide (2-CdATP), active<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"125680-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 18% to 35%, unchanged<\/li><li>Renal clearance: 51% of total clearance<\/li><li>Dialyzable: unknown<\/li><li>Total body clearance: 663.5 mL\/hr\/kg to 978 mL\/hr\/kg<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"125680-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"6.7 hr <br\/>"}}},{"id":"125680-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>use proper procedures for handling and disposal of chemotherapy<br\/><\/li><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(single daily infusion) dilute the appropriated dose through a 0.22 micron hydrophilic syringe filter into 500 mL of NS; do NOT use D5W due to increased degradation of cladribine<\/li><li>(7-day infusion) dilute in bacteriostatic NS; pass the calculated dose and bacteriostatic NS sequentially through a 0.22 micron hydrophilic syringe filter while adding them to the infusion reservoir to bring the total volume to 100 mL<\/li><li>(7-day infusion) for patients weighing more than 85 kg, there may be greater dilution of the benzyl alcohol preservative and therefore reduced preservative effectiveness<\/li><li>infuse promptly after preparation, or refrigerate for no more than 8 hours before administration<\/li><li>do not mix with other IV drugs or additives, or administer via a common IV line<\/li><li>(single daily infusion) infuse diluted infusion solution IV continuously over 24 hours; diluted solution is stable for 24 hours at room temperature in Baxter Viaflex(R) PVC infusion containers; adherence to recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised<\/li><li>(7-day infusion) infuse diluted infusion solution IV continuously over 7 days; diluted solution is stable for at least 7 days in a SIMS Deltec Medication Cassette(TM) Reservoir; adherence to recommended diluents and infusion systems is advised<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"125680-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>peripheral blood count normalization may indicate efficacy<\/li><li>bone marrow aspiration and biopsy; after normalization of peripheral blood counts<\/li><li>peripheral blood counts; regularly and especially during the first 4 to 8 weeks after treatment<\/li><li>renal function; as clinically indicated, especially in patients with preexisting renal impairment<\/li><li>liver function; as clinically indicated, especially in patients with preexisting liver dysfunction<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome; especially in patients with large tumor burden or at risk of tumor lysis syndrome<\/li><li>fever and signs of infection; during the first month of treatment<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"125680-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 1 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Novaplus Cladribine<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 1 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"125680-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"125680-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>CLADRIBINE<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Myelosuppression, paraparesis\/quadriparesis, renal dysfunction, and fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections have occurred.
