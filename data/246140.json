MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. The proton relaxation effect (PRE) of an unpaired electron is 700 times stronger than that of a proton itself.   In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadopentetate dimeglumine shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. In the central nervous system (CNS), gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances visualization of normal tissues that lack a blood-brain barrier, such as the pituitary gland and the meninges. Gadopentetate dimeglumine does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadopentetate dimeglumine in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts. Outside the CNS, gadopentetate dimeglumine rapidly reaches equilibrium in the interstitial compartment and enhances signal in all tissues as a function of delivery and size of the interstitial compartment.  <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"246140-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"3":{"id":"246140-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Renal: 83% <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"246140-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 1.6  plus or minus  0.13 h <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"246140-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>rate of administration should not exceed 10 mL\/15 sec.<\/li><li>a normal saline flush (5 mL) should follow contrast gadopentetate dimeglumine administration.<\/li><li>complete the imaging procedure within 1 hour of administration.<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"246140-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>renal function prior to drug administration<\/li><li>blood pressure and heart rate for several hours after gadopentetate dimeglumine administration<\/li><li>signs and\/or symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, including burning, itching, scaling, hardening, and tightening of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; and joint stiffness<\/li><li>local injection reaction, including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"246140-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Magnevist<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Solution: 496.01 MG\/ML<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"246140-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Drug may cause headache, nausea, dizziness, and injection-site\/localized coldness.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report signs\/symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (burning, itching, swelling, scaling, hardening and tightening of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; muscle weakness; pain in hips or ribs; and joint stiffness).<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
