In the liver, in the space of Disse, technetium Tc 99m disofenin becomes dissociated from the proteins and enters the hepatocyte by a mechanism similar to that of serum bilirubin. Technetium Tc 99m disofenin traverses the hepatocyte un-metabolized and enters the bile canaliculi. Flow beyond the canaliculi is influenced, to a large extent, by the tone of the sphincter of Oddi and the patency of the bile ducts. Clear visualization of the gallbladder and intestines with technetium Tc 99m disofenin demonstrates hepatobiliary tract patency     <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"925213-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"3":{"id":"925213-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 9%<\/li><li>Bile: extensive<\/li><\/ul>"}}},"9":{"id":"925213-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>write the estimated activity, date, and time of preparation on the space provided on the label and attach to the neck of the vial<\/li><li>water proof gloves should be worn during preparation<\/li><li>add 4 to 5 mL of Sodium Pertechnetate TC 99m to the reaction in a suitable radiation shield<\/li><li> use only preservative free sodium chloride injection for dilution<\/li><li>do not introduce air into the vial during reconstitution<\/li><li>after reconstitution place radiation shield on the vial, swirl contents, and let stand for 4 minutes<\/li><li>assay the product with a suitable dose calibrator<\/li><li>maintain adequate shielding during the life of the product and use dose within 6 hours of preparation<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"925213-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"no specific monitoring has been determined<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"925213-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>This drug may cause itching at the injection site which may progress to erythema multiforme.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to fast, preferably for 4 hours prior to administration\/imaging; otherwise false positives (non-visualization) may result.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
