PHARMACOLOGY: Pentoxifylline reduces blood viscosity and improves the flow properties of blood. It increases blood flow to the affected microcirculation and tissue oxygenation in patients with chronic peripheral arterial disease. It also produces dose-related hemorrheologic effects, improves erythrocyte flexibility, increases leukocyte deformability and inhibits neutrophil adhesion and activation.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In several overdose cases, onset of symptoms was within 4 to 5 hours of ingestion and lasted for about 12 hours. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common. Myoclonus may be seen. SEVERE TOXICITY: Flushing, somnolence, loss of consciousness, confusion, disorientation, hypokalemia, tachycardia, bradycardia with AV block, hypotension, hyperreflexia, seizures, agitation, fever, heart failure leading to respiratory insufficiency with hypoxemia have been reported. Death due to refractory shock has been reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal discomfort, and dizziness. RARE: The following adverse effects have rarely been reported in postmarketing surveillance of pentoxifylline therapy, however, causality was not established: Tachycardia, hypotension, dysrhythmias, aplastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, seizures, anaphylactoid reactions and anaphylactic reactions. <br\/>"},{"id":"454100-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PENTOXIFYLLINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Control agitation with benzodiazepines. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat agitation with benzodiazepines. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Monitor CVP to prevent volume overload.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression or persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, and significant CNS or respiratory depression.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Administer oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor for possible CNS signs\/symptoms of seizures or CNS depression following severe overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring following significant overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to it's large volume of distribution (241 to 511 L), hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of benefit in pentoxifylline overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home with medical follow-up. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent cardiac dysrhythmias, mental status changes, seizures, and respiratory failure should be admitted to an ICU setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"454100-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>PENTOXIFYLLINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Flushing, seizures, hypotension, loss of consciousness and agitation have been reported following pentoxifylline doses up to 80 mg\/kg.
