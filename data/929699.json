PHARMACOLOGY: Fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it may reduce lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Limited data. OVERDOSE: Based on premarketing experience, single doses up to 80-fold the recommended dose (0.5 mg) resulted in no significant clinical events. Events are anticipated to be an extension of therapeutic adverse effects. A 4-year-old child ingested a single 0.5-mg tablet and subsequently developed AV block I and II, as well as hypotension and mild bradycardia. He recovered with supportive care. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Transient mild bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances may develop. Fingolimod may increase the risk of infection and macular edema. Mild elevations in transaminase concentrations may occur. SEVERE TOXICITY: Symptomatic bradydysrhythmias and AV blocks, dyspnea, severe infections, and hepatic injury. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Events appear to be dose-dependent. COMMON: The most common adverse events, occurring in more than 10% of patients, include headache, influenza, cough, diarrhea, back pain, and asymptomatic liver transaminase elevations. A decrease in lymphocyte count has been observed shortly after the start of therapy; lymphocyte counts reach a mean of 500 to 600 mm(3) within hours and then stabilize. Leukopenia and neutropenia may also be observed. Other events include bradycardia, hypertension, dyspnea, herpes infections, depression, dry mouth, blurred vision, and dizziness.<br\/>"},{"id":"929699-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>FINGOLIMOD<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited data. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Transient bradycardia usually does not require intervention. Atropine can reverse the negative chronotropic effect of fingolimod and may be indicated in clinically significant bradycardia. Atropine: Adult Dose: 0.5 mg to 1 mg IV every 5 min. Maximum total dose is 3 mg or 0.04 mg\/kg.  Minimum single dose is 0.5 mg. Pediatric Dose: 0.02 mg\/kg IV repeat every 5 min; minimum single dose is 0.1 mg; maximum single dose for a child is 0.5 mg, and 1 mg for an adolescent; maximum total dose for a child is 1 mg and 2 mg for an adolescent. SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Atropine is indicated to treat clinically significant bradycardia. Isoproterenol may also be indicated in some patients. Monitor for atrioventricular conduction disturbances or heart block. Treat infections as indicated. Monitor hepatic enzymes for evidence of liver injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a recent, significant overdose who is alert or in whom the airway is protected. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a recent, significant overdose who is alert or in whom the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may rarely be required in patients with severe respiratory depression and\/or significant cardiac toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote for fingolimod.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Obtain a baseline ECG and repeat as needed; continuous cardiac monitoring is indicated for several hours after exposure due to the risk of transient decreases in heart rate and\/or conduction disturbances. Monitor serial CBC with differential following a significant exposure. Lymphocytopenia has been reported with therapy. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection. Assess liver enzymes (ie, transaminases).<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are unlikely to be useful following a fingolimod overdose because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  Asymptomatic patients with an inadvertent overdose who are on chronic therapy may be managed at home. Transient decreases in heart rate are common after the first dose of fingolimod; fingolimod-naive adults or children should be sent to a healthcare facility for monitoring.  OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients that are fingolimod-naive should be monitored for at least 6 hours following an intentional or inadvertent exposure due to the potential risk of transient decreases in heart rate. Symptomatic patients or those with deliberate overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation. CONSULT CRITERIA: Call a Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (ie, persistent bradycardia) or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.
