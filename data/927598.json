Teriparatide stimulates bone formation as shown by increases in the bone formation markers serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and procollagen I carboxy-terminal protide (PICP)<\/li><li>Endogenous (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. The biological actions of (PTH) and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Both teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney.<\/li><li>Teriparatide acetate for diagnostic aid:<\/li><li>Administration of the exogenous human parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, distinguishes between hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism by testing the patients responsiveness to parathyroid hormone (PTH). Teriparatide stimulates the urinary excretion of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and phosphate. Response values are calculated from the measurements of urinary cAMP, serum phosphate, and urinary phosphate, and corrected for creatinine excretion. <\/li><li>In patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (a deficiency in PTH secretion), teriparatide will produce normal or increased responses in urinary cAMP and phosphate excretion.   In contrast, patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism (a rare form of hypoparathyroidism resulting from target tissue resistance to PTH), because they are unable to respond to PTH, will exhibit a blunted to normal response in urinary cAMP excretion, depending on whether it is   type 1 or 2 pseudohypoparathyroidism, and a blunted phosphaturic response .<\/li><li>Renal-Calcium clearance is reduced and tubular phosphate reabsorption is inhibited, thereby increasing phosphate excretion. Parathyroid hormone indirectly increases the intestinal transport of calcium by increasing renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 production , and increases sodium and potassium excretion. These renal effects may be due to a direct action of the hormone on its receptors. <\/li><li>Skeletal-Initial effect on bone is to promote an increased rate of release of calcium from bone into the blood, possibly mediated by an effect on osteocytes or osteoclasts. <\/li><li>Serum-Plasma cAMP values are increased in normal subjects after teriparatide infusion, but response may be blunted in type 1 pseudohypoparathyroidism; serum prolactin and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 are increased but responses may be blunted in type 1 pseudohypoparathyroidism; however, differentiation between type 1 and type 2 pseudohypoparathyroidism depends on renal responses to teriparatide, not changes in measurements of plasma cAMP, prolactin, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3. <\/li><li>Time to peak excretion:<\/li><li>cAMP-During the first 30 minutes postinfusion. <\/li><li>Phosphate-During the second 30 minutes postinfusion .<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"927598-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"927598-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Bioavailability: 95% <br\/>"},{"id":"927598-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 0.12 L\/kg.<br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"927598-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Subcutaneous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>inject into the thigh or abdominal wall<\/li><li>initial injection should occur where the patient is able to sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur<\/li><li>injection may be given immediately after removing from refrigerator<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"927598-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>biochemical markers of bone formation\/resorption<\/li><li>radiologic evidence of fracture<\/li><li>serum calcium<\/li><li>urinary calcium; in patients with suspected active urolithiasis or pre-existing hypercalciuria<\/li><li>serum uric acid<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of osteosarcoma<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"927598-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Forteo<\/b><br\/>Subcutaneous Solution: 250 MCG\/ML<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"927598-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"927598-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>TERIPARATIDE<\/b><br\/>Teriparatide (rDNA origin) contains recombinant human parathyroid hormone which has a sequence to the 34 N-terminal amino acids of the 84-amino acid human parathyroid hormone, which is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney.

Inadvertent administration of up to 800 mcg of teriparatide as a single dose has caused transient hypotension, nausea, and weakness\/lethargy. No fatalities occurred. ADVERSE EVENTS: Commonly reported whole body events include: pain (21.3%), headache (7.5%), asthenia (8.7%), arthralgia (10.1%), and neck pain (3.0%). Other frequently reported clinical symptoms were hypertension (7.1%), syncope (2.6%), nausea (8.5%), vomiting (3.0%), dizziness (8.0%), rhinitis (9.6%), and cough (6.4%). Transient hypercalcemia has been reported with treatment with the peak response occurring approximately 4 to 6 hours after administration. In postmarketing experience, reports of acute allergic reaction (dyspnea, oro\/facial edema and generalized urticaria and chest pain) and hypercalcemia have occurred.
