HCG exerts nearly identical effects as LH in activating the production of gonadal steroid hormones to produce androgens and progesterone and in influencing the development of male secondary sex characteristics and in normal menstrual cycle, but it has a weak FSH activity. It sustains the corpus luteum during pregnancy, causing it to secrete estrogen and progesterone.<br\/>"},"9":{"id":"261025-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intramuscular<\/b><br\/><ul><li>for IM use only<\/li><li>(Novarel(R)) reconstitute with bacteriostatic water for injection; reconstituted solution stable for 30 days when refrigerated; refrigerate reconstituted at 2 to 8 degrees C (36 to 46 degrees F)<\/li><li>(generic version) reconstitute with bacteriostatic water for injection; reconstituted solution stable for 60 days when refrigerated<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"261025-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>serum progesterone, luteinizing hormone<\/li><li>estradiol levels<\/li><li>ovarian ultrasound day 7 and 14 (ovarian enlargement, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome)<\/li><li>onset of ovulation<\/li><li>routine pelvic exam<\/li><li>cryptorchidism: signs of precocious puberty<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"261025-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Intramuscular Powder for Solution: 10000 U<br\/><\/li><li><b>Novarel<\/b><br\/>Intramuscular Powder for Solution: 10000 U<br\/><\/li><li><b>Pregnyl<\/b><br\/>Intramuscular Powder for Solution: 10000 U<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"261025-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"This drug may cause gynecomastia, precocious puberty, thromboembolic disorder, headache, or irritability.<br\/>"}}}
