PHARMACOLOGY: Partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, antagonist at the kappa opioid receptor. TOXICOLOGY: The toxicity is an extension of the pharmacology. Effects include CNS depression, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. Hypotension can occur from mast cell G protein activation and subsequent degranulation of histamine-containing vesicles. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Buprenorphine exposures are common. In adults, severe toxicity may occur from crushing and injecting tablets, but is not common after ingesting buprenorphine alone. Children are at risk for toxicity following ingestion of less than a single tablet. While most deaths are due to overdose, deaths following inadvertent ingestion have occurred. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Miosis, sedation, and relative bradycardia. Hepatitis is reported rarely. SEVERE POISONING: CNS depression, coma, respiratory depression, and hypotension. Children, in particular, may develop profound, recurrent, or delayed CNS and respiratory depression. In adults, severe effects are generally only seen after crushing and injecting tablets, or after very large ingestions. Acute renal failure is reported rarely. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Sedation, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, and withdrawal syndrome. At high doses, buprenorphine's agonist effects plateau (\"ceiling effect\"), limiting the maximum analgesic and respiratory depressant effects. Due to this \"ceiling effect,\" patients who are chronic users\/abusers of opioids can experience withdrawal after ingestion of buprenorphine.<br\/>"},{"id":"929645-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BUPRENORPHINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: For patients who have CNS depression without airway compromise or respiratory depression, close monitoring and supplemental oxygen and supportive care is usually all that is required. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care (intravenous crystalloid, supplemental oxygen, and assisted ventilation), may be required. Naloxone can be given for respiratory depression in order to eliminate the need for intubation.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient can reliably protect their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: Naloxone (adults and children): initial dose 1 mg IV, may repeat. High doses of naloxone (10 to 35 mg in adults) have been used to reverse respiratory depression induced by buprenorphine. The peak effect of naloxone reversal may also be delayed (up to 30 minutes in some cases).<\/li><li>Decreased respiratory function: Bag valve mask ventilation and naloxone; endotracheal intubation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Supplemental oxygen; PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Intravenous crystalloid; if hypotension persists, administer dopamine or norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, respiratory effort, and mental status. Monitor arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, and renal function in patients with severe poisoning. Obtain a chest x-ray in patients with clinical evidence of pulmonary edema. Routine urine toxicology opioid assays generally do not detect buprenorphine.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for enhanced elimination techniques.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management of inadvertent buprenorphine ingestion in children, as significant toxicity has resulted after ingestion of half a tablet. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or children with any ingestion should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation. All symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation. All patients should be monitored for a minimum of 12 to 24 hours due to the potential for delayed or recurrent respiratory and CNS depression. ADMISSION CRITERIA: All symptomatic patients should be admitted. Patients with significant persistent CNS depression or those with respiratory depression or hypotension should be admitted to an intensive care setting. Patients requiring multiple doses of naloxone or those who are on a naloxone infusion should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity (coma, severe CNS depression, respiratory failure or severe hypotension), or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929645-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>BUPRENORPHINE <\/b><br\/>TOXIC DOSE: ADULT: Ingestion of 88 mg of buprenorphine in an adult resulted in severe opiate withdrawal.
