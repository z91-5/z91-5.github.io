It is only intended for ITP patients at significant risk for bleeding. PHARMACOLOGY: Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist. It is able to interact with the transmembrane domain of the human TPO-receptor and initiates signaling cascades that induce proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive exposure may increase platelet counts and result in thrombotic and\/or thromboembolic events. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Eltrombopag is only available through a restricted distribution program due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. At the time of this review, the overall risk of exposure is limited. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: It is anticipated that toxicity is likely an extension of pharmacologic events which may include the development of thrombocytosis, hepatotoxicity, bone marrow reticulin formation and bone marrow fibrosis. Rash, bradycardia, elevated aminotransferase concentrations, and thrombocytosis have been reported after overdose. SEVERE POISONING: An excessive increase in platelet count may increase the risk of developing a thrombotic and\/or thromboembolic events. ADVERSE EFFECTS: SERIOUS: Potentially serious events reported with therapy have included: abnormal increase in liver enzymes and bilirubin, thrombotic\/thromboembolic complications, and the development of hemorrhage following the discontinuation of therapy. OTHER: Nausea, vomiting, menorrhagia, myalgia, paresthesia, cataract, dyspepsia, ecchymosis, thrombocytopenia and conjunctival hemorrhage have been observed with therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"929242-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ELTROMBOPAG<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: An excessive exposure may increase the platelet count leading to the development of thrombotic\/thromboembolic events. Monitor serial CBC and platelet counts. Evidence of an acute thrombotic\/thromboembolic event (e.g., sudden onset of swelling\/tenderness in a limb and\/or shortness of breath) requires prompt diagnostic evaluation (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan, venogram, etc) and intervention as indicated. Cytapheresis may be useful in patients who develop severe thrombocytosis. Monitor for rebound thrombocytopenia and potential bleeding following the discontinuation of eltrombopag therapy. Transfuse patient as indicated for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding. Hepatotoxicity has been observed with therapy; monitor liver enzymes (i.e., ALT, AST, and bilirubin) following overdose.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient who is awake and alert and able to protect their airway. Oral administration of a metal cation-containing preparation (e.g., calcium, aluminum, or magnesium) may be indicated to chelate eltrombopag and limit absorption. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal or gastric lavage, if the patient is able to maintain airway or if airway is protected. Based on limited experience, oral administration of a metal cation-containing preparation (e.g., calcium, aluminum, or magnesium) may be indicated to chelate eltrombopag and limit absorption.<\/li><li>Airway management: Assess airway patency. Oxygen therapy may be required in patients who develop a thromboembolic event, but this is rare with therapeutic use.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Bleeding: Rebound thrombocytopenia has been observed with the discontinuation of eltrombopag therapy. Monitor CBC and platelet count. Blood transfusions may be indicated for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain serial CBC with differential and platelet counts. Monitor vital signs and liver enzyme levels in symptomatic patients; repeat as indicated. Monitor electrolytes and fluid status in patients with significant vomiting.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Eltrombopag is highly bound to plasma proteins and hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with a minor inadvertent ingestion can be monitored at home. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions that are demonstrating severe hepatotoxicity, an increased platelet count that may produce a thrombolic\/thromboembolic event or evidence of bleeding (rebound effect) should be admitted. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with a deliberate ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with an unintentional ingestion who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility.
