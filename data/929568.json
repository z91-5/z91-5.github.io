Amifampridine is used for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in adults. PHARMACOLOGY: Dalfampridine is a broad spectrum potassium channel blocker; however, it is unknown how it exerts its therapeutic effect. Animal studies demonstrated an increase in conduction of action potentials in demyelinated axons through inhibition of potassium channels. Dalfampridine neither prolongs the QTc interval nor has any meaningful effect on the QRS duration. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose ingestions have occasionally occurred; however, severe toxicity is rare. TOXICITY: DALFAMPRIDINE: Altered mental status, seizures, weakness, memory loss, hypophonic speech, choreoathetoid movements, diaphoresis, vomiting, and metabolic acidosis have occurred following overdose ingestions of 4-aminopyridine. AMIFAMPRIDINE: Nausea, vomiting, paresthesias, seizures, and cardiac complications, including supraventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest, have been reported in one patient following a 6-fold overdose over 6 days. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Insomnia, dizziness, headache, paresthesia, seizures, urinary tract infections, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and back pain have been reported following therapeutic administration of 4-aminopyridine.<br\/>"},{"id":"929568-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DALFAMPRIDINE\/4-AMINOPYRIDINE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most 4-aminopyridine exposures require supportive care only. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat seizures with benzodiazepines. Status epilepticus should be treated with high-dose benzodiazepines, followed by propofol and\/or barbiturates if benzodiazepines are ineffective. Manage airway in patients with recurrent seizures.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended due to the potential for seizures. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain their airway or if airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management may be necessary for severe refractory seizures.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines; add propofol and\/or barbiturates if seizures recur or persist.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific lab work (e.g., CBC, electrolyte, urinalysis) is needed unless otherwise indicated.  4-aminopyridine levels are not clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are unlikely to be effective following dalfampridine overdose ingestions due to its large volume of distribution (2.6 L\/kg).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with neurologic toxicity should be treated and observed until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with demonstrating seizure activity or other persistent neurotoxicity should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929568-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>DALFAMPRIDINE\/4-AMINOPYRIDINE AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: DALFAMPRIDINE: Ingestion of 0.6 mg\/kg may produce toxic signs and symptoms which require hospitalization. In the clinical setting, 1 mg\/kg administered IV in postoperative patients has resulted in restlessness, confusion (seizures) and central nervous system excitation during the recovery period. Ingestion of 90 to 125 mg caused status epilepticus in adults. AMIFAMPRIDINE: Ingestion of 60 mg 6 times daily for approximately 8 days, instead of the prescribed 10 mg 6 times daily, resulted in nausea, vomiting, paresthesias, generalized seizures, dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: DALFAMPRIDINE: The maximum recommended dose of dalfampridine is 10 mg twice daily. AMIFAMPRIDINE: Initially, the recommended oral dose is 15 mg\/day, given in divided doses 3 or 4 times daily. The dose may be increased in 5 mg increments every 4 to 5 days, up to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg. A single dose should not exceed 20 mg. <br\/>"}]},"13":{"id":"929568-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Advise patient this drug may cause seizures.
