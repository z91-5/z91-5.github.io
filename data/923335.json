In the acidic environment of the gastric parietal cell , lansoprazole is converted to active   sulphenamide derivatives   that bind to the sulfhydryl group   of (H +, K +)-adenosine triphosphatase [(H +, K +)-ATPase] , also known as the proton pump . (H +, K +)-ATPase catalyzes   the final step in the gastric acid secretion pathway . Lansoprazole's inhibition of (H +, K +)-ATPase results in inhibition of both centrally and peripherally mediated gastric acid secretion . The inhibitory effect is dose-related . Lansoprazole inhibits both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion regardless of the stimulus .<\/li><li>Following oral administration, lansoprazole significantly decreases basal acid output and significantly increases the mean gastric pH and percent of time the gastric pH remains above 3 and 4 . It also significantly reduces meal-stimulated gastric acid output   and secretion volume , as well as pentagastrin-stimulated acid output . In addition, lansoprazole inhibits the normal increases in secretion volume, acidity, and acid output induced by insulin .<\/li><li>Lansoprazole does not have anticholinergic or histamine H 2-receptor antagonist properties .<\/li><li>Due to the normal physiologic effects caused by the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, blood flow in the antrum, pylorus, and duodenal bulb is decreased by about 17% ; however, mucosal blood flow in the fundus of the stomach is not significantly affected by lansoprazole . Gastric emptying of digestible solids following intake of lansoprazole is significantly slowed . Lansoprazole increases serum pepsinogen levels and decreases pepsin activity   under basal conditions and in response to meal stimulation or insulin injection . As with other agents that elevate intragastric pH, lansoprazole may cause an increase in the number of nitrate-reducing bacteria   and an elevation in the nitrate concentration of gastric secretions in patients with gastric ulcer ; however, significantly elevated nitrosamine levels have not been reported to date , suggesting no risk of carcinogenesis by this mechanism .<\/li><li>Lansoprazole   and its active metabolites   have demonstrated antimicrobial activity in vitro   against Helicobacter pylori     , a gram-negative bacilli strongly associated with peptic ulcers . Lansoprazole may influence the mucosal immune response to H. pylori     . Mucosal H. pylori-specific IgA response is significantly enhanced after short-term treatment with lansoprazole, strongly suggesting that the secretory immune system is actively involved in host defense against H. pylori , and that the efficacy of such a system at the gastric mucosal level is crucial for complete eradication of H. pylori     . Although lansoprazole alone has a relatively low clearance effect on H. pylori     , it may enhance the ability of other agents to eradicate the organism ; lansoprazole's activity as an antisecretory agent may be the more important factor explaining its effectiveness .<\/li><li>Lansoprazole has the ability to inhibit the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system .<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"923335-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"923335-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Rapidly absorbed;<\/li><li>Bioavailability: &gt; 80%; food may decrease absorption<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923335-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 0.5 L\/kg <br\/>"},{"id":"923335-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic    <br\/>"},{"id":"923335-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Biliary\/Fecal: 2\/3; Renal: 14 to 25%, &lt;1% unchanged    <br\/>"},{"id":"923335-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 1.5 h Adults; 1.9 to 2.9 h Elderly    <br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"923335-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>Nasogastric<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(delayed-release capsule) size 16 French or larger nasogastric tube, in adults; open capsule, mix intact granules with 40 mL apple juice ONLY, and inject through nasogastric tube; flush with additional apple juice to clear tube<\/li><li>(delayed-release capsule) size less than 8 French nasogastric tube, suspend capsule granules in 8.4% sodium bicarbonate; if the tube becomes blocked, lock the tube with sodium bicarbonate to dissolve the enteric coating on the granules to unblock the tube<\/li><li>(orally disintegrating tablet) size 8 French or larger nasogastric tube; place 15 mg tablet in syringe and draw up 4 mL of water, or place a 30 mg tablet in a syringe and draw up 10 mL of water; shake gently; inject through nasogastric tube within 15 minutes; refill syringe with approximately 5 mL of water, shake gently, and flush the tube.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>take before eating<\/li><li>swallow whole; do not crush or chew<\/li><li>(delayed-release capsule) capsule may be opened and granules sprinkled on 1 tablespoon of applesauce, Ensure(R) pudding, cottage cheese, yogurt, or strained pears; swallow immediately<\/li><li>(delayed-release capsule) capsule may be emptied into 60 mL of apple juice, orange juice, or tomato juice, mixed, and swallowed immediately; rinse glass with at least 2 volumes of juice and swallow contents to ensure complete delivery of the dose<\/li><li>(orally disintegrating tablets) do not break or cut tablet; do not chew tablet; place tablet on tongue and allow to disintegrate, with or without water, until particles can be swallowed<\/li><li>(orally disintegrating tablet via oral syringe) place 15 mg tablet in oral syringe, draw up approximately 4 mL of water, or place a 30 mg tablet in oral syringe and draw up approximately 10 mL of water; shake gently, and administer within 15 minutes; refill syringe with approximately 2 mL (or 5 mL for the 30 mg tablet), shake gently, and administer contents<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"923335-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>decreased abdominal and gastroesophageal discomfort<\/li><li>endoscopic improvement<\/li><li>serum magnesium, prior to initiation and periodically during prolonged therapy<\/li><li>CBC<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"923335-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Capsule, Delayed Release: 15 MG, 30 MG<\/li><li>Oral Tablet Disintegrating, Delayed Release: 15 MG, 30 MG<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>First - Lansoprazole<\/b><br\/>Oral Powder for Suspension: 3 MG\/ML<br\/><\/li><li><b>Heartburn Relief 24 Hour<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule, Delayed Release: 15 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Heartburn Treatment 24 Hour<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule, Delayed Release: 15 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Prevacid<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule, Delayed Release: 15 MG, 30 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Prevacid SoluTab<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet Disintegrating, Delayed Release: 15 MG, 30 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Rite Aid Lansoprazole<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule, Delayed Release: 15 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Topcare Lansoprazole<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule, Delayed Release: 15 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"923335-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"923335-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>OMEPRAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole are substituted benzimidazoles and potent proton-pump inhibitors used as gastric antisecretories.  They are used to treat various gastrointestinal conditions (eg, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), duodenal and peptic ulcers, and esophageal stricture).  Esomeprazole with naproxen and omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate combinations are also available. Refer to \"NAPROXEN\" and \"SODIUM BICARBONATE\" management for specific information. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents inhibit the parietal cell membrane enzyme (H+\/K+)-ATPase, typically referred to as the proton pump, which blocks the final step of acid production. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare, and only mild toxicity has been reported. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. In limited overdose cases, clinical effects have consisted of mild tachycardia, flushing, somnolence, confusion, headache, blurred vision, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, and moderate leukocytosis. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Proton-pump inhibitors have similar adverse events reported after therapeutic use. COMMON (2% or greater): Headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and flatulence. OTHER EFFECTS: Constipation, dry mouth, hypertension, and dizziness. RARE: Lichen spinulosus, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticaria, anaphylaxis, hypomagnesemia, pancreatitis, elevated serum creatinine levels, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, optic atrophy, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, hypocalcemic-induced seizures. ACUTE INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS: Although rare, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been reported in association with all proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).  The mean duration of treatment prior to onset of symptoms is reported at 9 to 13 weeks.  A decline in renal function is usually noted over a period of days to weeks. Fatigue, malaise, weakness, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss are commonly reported symptoms.  Classic drug hypersensitivity signs and symptoms, such as the clinical triad of rash, fever and eosinophilia, are seen in less than 10% of patients.<br\/>"},{"id":"923335-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OMEPRAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
