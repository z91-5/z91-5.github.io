Mechlorethamine is also used intrapleurally, intraperitoneally, or intrapericardially for the palliative treatment of metastatic carcinoma resulting in effusion. Mechlorethamine gel is used for the topical treatment of stage IA and IB mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who have received prior skin-directed therapy. PHARMACOLOGY: Mechlorethamine hydrochloride, also known as HN2 hydrochloride, is an antineoplastic agent that is nitrogen analog of sulfur mustard. As a biologic alkylating agent, it exerts its cytotoxic effects by inhibiting the rapid proliferation of cancer cells. TOXICOLOGY: Overdose effects are seen primarily in rapidly dividing cells (eg, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Severe leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a hemorrhagic diathesis with subsequent delayed bleeding may develop following total doses higher than 0.4 mg\/kg of body weight for a single course. Exposure of the eyes to mechlorethamine results in inflammation, pain, burning, photophobia, and blurred vision. Irreversible anterior eye injury and blindness may occur. ADVERSE EFFECTS: INTRAVENOUS: Nausea and vomiting (onset: 1 to 3 hours; duration: 8 to 24 hours), anorexia, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, maculopapular skin eruption, erythema multiforme, extravasation injury, jaundice, alopecia, vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, weakness, headache, drowsiness, vertigo, lightheadedness, seizures, progressive muscle paralysis, paresthesia, cerebral degeneration, coma, and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. HEMATOLOGIC EFFECTS: Severe myelosuppression has occasionally occurred and may be observed for up to 50 days or more after initiating mechlorethamine therapy. Lymphocytopenia (onset within 24 hours), granulocytopenia (onset within 6 to 8 days and lasts for 10 days to 3 weeks), thrombocytopenia (onset and duration, similar to granulocyte levels), persistent pancytopenia, and hemorrhagic complications have been reported. DERMAL: COMMON (5% or greater): Dermatitis, pruritus, bacterial skin infection, skin ulceration or blistering, and hyperpigmentation. <br\/>"},{"id":"363300-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MECHLORETHAMINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. <\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: INGESTION: Exposure of the oral mucosa to mechlorethamine gel may result in pain, redness, and ulceration which may be severe. Patients may already have severe vomiting and gastrointestinal irritation. Administer activated charcoal if the ingestion is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain their airway. GI decontamination is not indicated after parenteral mechlorethamine exposure. DERMAL: Wash skin thoroughly with soap and water. OCULAR: Irrigate exposed eyes for at least 15 minutes. HOSPITAL: INGESTION: Administer activated charcoal if the ingestion is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain their airway. GI decontamination is not indicated after parenteral mechlorethamine exposure. DERMAL: Wash skin thoroughly with soap and water; 2% sodium thiosulfate may be useful for decontaminating the skin. OCULAR: Irrigate exposed eyes for at least 15 minutes.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). For large overdoses, consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP\/liter NS or LR) has also been used for perfusion. Give dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Airway management: Maintain open airway and perform orotracheal intubation if there are symptoms of airway or pulmonary injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. For example: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with mechlorethamine overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Administer sodium thiosulfate (see dosing below). Elevate the affected area. Ice packs can be applied for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable). Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy. SODIUM THIOSULFATE: Prepare a 0.17 moles\/L (1\/6 molar) solution by mixing 4 mL sodium thiosulfate 10% weight\/volume with 6 mL sterile water for injection. Inject 2 mL subQ of sodium thiosulfate solution for each mg (mL) of mechlorethamine suspected to have extravasated into extravasation site using a 25-gauge or smaller needle (the needle is changed with each injection). Another source recommended the following dosing: inject 3 to 10 mL subQ into extravasation site.<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Mechlorethamine plasma concentrations are not clinically useful or readily available. Monitor vital signs, serum electrolytes, renal function and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Clinically evaluate patients for the development of mucositis. Monitor arterial blood gases and\/or pulse oximetry, chest radiograph, and pulmonary function tests in patients with respiratory symptoms.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with mechlorethamine overdose need to be admitted, as toxicity develops over several days. Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with mechlorethamine overdose. In addition, consultation with an infectious diseases physician with expertise in the management of neutropenic patients with infections is strongly recommended. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"363300-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MECHLORETHAMINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Severe leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a hemorrhagic diathesis with subsequent delayed bleeding may develop following total doses higher than 0.4 mg\/kg for a single course.
