is approved for the treatment of infections caused by various gram-positive organisms including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Tedizolid phosphate is approved for the treatment of adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible gram-positive microorganisms of Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant and susceptible isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (which includes S anginosus, S intermedius, and S constellatus) and Enterococcus faecalis. Eperezolid is not available in the United States. PHARMACOLOGY: Linezolid is an oxazolidinones that inhibits the bacterial ribosomal translation process, of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and certain Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, by  selectively binding to a site on the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S  subunit, thereby preventing initiation complex formation with the 70S ribosomal subunit. Tedizolid phosphate is the prodrug of tedizolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, which inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Human overdose information is limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. OTHER EFFECTS: Rash, toxic optic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy, tongue discoloration, elevated liver enzymes, pseudomembranous colitis, seizures, lactic acidosis, myelosuppression, including anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Serotonin syndrome, characterized by fever, agitation, mental status changes, and tremors, has been reported infrequently following concomitant administration of linezolid and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. <br\/>"},{"id":"925206-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OXAZOLIDINONE ANTIBACTERIALS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Myelosuppression has been reported. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg, filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding. For seizures, administer IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Not recommended because of potential for seizures. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in a patient with a recent, substantial overdose who is alert or in whom airway is protected.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Airway management: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe seizures.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor. Filgrastim 5 mcg\/kg\/day subQ or IV over 15 to 30 minutes OR sargramostim 250 mcg\/meter(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Transfusion of platelets, packed red cells, or both may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage.<\/li><li>Serotonin syndrome: Concomitant use of linezolid with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor has resulted in a serotonin syndrome; this is attributed to linezolid's action as a weak reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Primary treatment is sedation with IV benzodiazepines, and cooling measures. CYPROHEPTADINE: A serotonin antagonist with high affinity for the 5-HT2 receptors; effective for milder cases of serotonin syndrome. Dose: ADULT: 12 mg orally or nasogastric tube, followed by 4 to 8 mg every 4 to 6 hours. CHILD: 0.25 mg\/kg\/day orally or nasogastric tube divided every 6 hours, maximum dose 12 mg\/day. CHLORPROMAZINE: A phenothiazine antipsychotic with 5-HT2 antagonist activity; indicated in severe serotonin syndrome cases. Dose: 12.5 to 50 mg IV, followed by 25 to 50 mg every 6 hours. It is NOT generally recommended because it may cause severe hypotension. Severe cases have been managed with benzodiazepine sedation and neuromuscular paralysis with nondepolarizing agents.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count. Myelosuppression, including anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving linezolid. Monitor serum electrolyte status in patients with significant diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Monitor for clinical evidence of serotonin syndrome.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: During a phase I clinical trial, approximately 30% of a dose of linezolid was removed during a 3-hour hemodialysis session that began 3 hours after administration of the dose.  Hemodialysis should only be considered in patients with severe toxicity not responding to supportive care.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a health care facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients with unintentional ingestions who are symptomatic should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"925206-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>OXAZOLIDINONE ANTIBACTERIALS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific minimum toxic dose has not been established.
