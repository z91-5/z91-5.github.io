The risk and benefits of therapy should be carefully considered prior to initiating treatment in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Evaluate for latent tuberculosis and treat if necessary prior to initiation of therapy. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative of latent TB prior to treatment.

PHARMACOLOGY: Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and blocks its interaction with endogenous cell surface TNF receptors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is very rare. TOXICITY: There are no reports of toxicity following acute overdose. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (greater than 10%) - Infections (eg; upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reaction, headache, and rash. LESS COMMON (5% to 10%): Nausea, abdominal pain, hematuria, hypercholesterolemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, and back pain. Although the causal relationship to adalimumab is not clear, the following adverse reactions were also reported during studies: New onset or worsening congestive heart failure, leucocytoclastic vasculitis, hypertension, angioneurotic edema, cellulitis, psoriasis, erysipelas, cutaneous vasculitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, optic neuritis, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, polycythemia, anaphylaxis, paresthesia, tremor, hepatic necrosis, elevated liver enzymes, and interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis. <br\/>"},{"id":"927665-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ADALIMUMAB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
