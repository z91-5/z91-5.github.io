Severe hypotension has been reported following a massive niacin overdose (11,000 milligrams). Elevated hepatic enzymes have developed following overdose. Laboratory findings have also included hypo- and hyperglycemia and coagulopathy in some exposures. A teenager developed a prolonged QTc interval after ingesting 5.5 grams of niacin. ADVERSE EVENTS: Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are frequent symptoms after oral niacin therapy. Other adverse effects include dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, chills, edema, syncope, dryness of the skin, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, stimulation of peptic ulcer, amblyopia, jaundice and elevated hepatic enzymes, decrease in glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia.

A 16-year-old girl developed epigastric discomfort and rash after taking 330 mg of niacin daily (more than 25 times the recommended daily allowance for a teenager).
