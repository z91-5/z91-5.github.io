Although the exact mechanism of action of fenofibrate is not completely understood, fenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate, produces reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total triglycerides and triglyceride rich lipoprotein (VLDL) in treated patients. Treatment with fenofibrate also results in increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoproteins apoAI and apoAII.<\/li><li>Fenofibric acid effects have been explained by the activation of perioxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Through this mechanism, fenofibrate increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity, apoprotein C-III. The fall in triglycerides produces an alteration in the composition and size of LDL from dense, small particles (possibly atherogenic), to buoyant, large particles. These larger particles are catabolized rapidly due to a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors. An increase in the synthesis of apoproteins A-I, A-II, and HDL-cholesterol also results by activation of PPARalpha.<\/li><li>Fenofibrate reduces serum uric acid concentrations in hyperuricemic and normal individuals by increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid..<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"924706-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"924706-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Effect of food, micronized fenofibrate: no effect; hard gelatin capsules (LIPOFEN(TM)): increased absorption with food <br\/>"},{"id":"924706-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 30 L <br\/>"},{"id":"924706-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Active metabolite: fenofibric acid <br\/>"},{"id":"924706-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: 25%; Renal: 60% metabolites <br\/>"},{"id":"924706-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Fenofibric acid, mean 20 hours (range 10-35 hours) <br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"924706-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Give Fenoglide(R), Lipofen(R), and Tricor(R) tablets with food.<\/li><li>Triglide(R) tablets may be taken with or without food.<\/li><li>Swallow Triglide(R) tablets whole; do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew tablets.<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"924706-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: lipid panel; periodically<\/li><li>hypertriglyceridemia: lipid panel; every 4 to 8 weeks<\/li><li>liver function, including ALT levels; baseline and regularly throughout the duration of therapy<\/li><li>HDL-C levels; within first few months<\/li><li>renal function in patients with renal impairment or in patients at risk for renal insufficiency (eg, elderly or patients with diabetes)<\/li><li>complete blood counts (RBC and WBC); periodically during the first 12 months<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"924706-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Capsule: 43 MG, 50 MG, 67 MG, 130 MG, 134 MG, 150 MG, 200 MG<\/li><li>Oral Tablet: 48 MG, 54 MG, 120 MG, 145 MG, 160 MG<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Fenoglide<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 40 MG, 120 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Lipofen<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 50 MG, 150 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Lofibra<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 54 MG, 160 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Tricor<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 48 MG, 145 MG<br\/><\/li><li><b>Triglide<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 50 MG, 160 MG<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"924706-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"924706-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>FENOFIBRATE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Fibrates are indicated to reduce elevated levels of LDL-C, Total-C, TG, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary or mixed dyslipidemia.
