The 26S proteasome degrades ubiquitinated proteins responsible in regulating intracellular concentrations of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, thereby affecting multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have shown that bortezomib is cytotoxic to many types of cancer cells in vitro. In non-clinical tumor models bortezomib caused a delay in in vivo tumor growth including multiple myeloma.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"927753-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"4":{"id":"927753-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 9 to 15 h <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"927753-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>use proper procedures for handling and disposal of chemotherapy<br\/><\/li><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute vial with 3.5 mL NS to a final concentration of 1 mg\/mL; use within 8 hours<\/li><li>place the appropriate route of administration sticker provided with the vial directly on the syringe after preparation  and on the outer container; fatalities have occurred with intrathecal administration<\/li><li>administer as a 3- to 5-second bolus IV injection<\/li><li>consecutive doses of bortezomib should be spaced apart by at least 72 hours<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Subcutaneous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute vial with 1.4 mL of NS to a final concentration of 2.5 mg\/mL; if injection site reaction occurs, reconstitute vial with 3.5 mL of NS to a final concentration of 1 mg\/mL or consider IV administration; use within 8 hours<\/li><li>place the appropriate route of administration sticker provided with the vial directly on the syringe after preparation  and on the outer container; fatalities have occurred with intrathecal administration<\/li><li>administer calculated dose into the thigh or abdomen; rotate sites with each injection; inject at least 1 inch from old sites<\/li><li>consecutive doses of bortezomib should be spaced apart by at least 72 hours<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"927753-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>efficacy is indicated by tumor response<\/li><li>CBC; frequently  with differential<\/li><li>platelet count; prior to each dose<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome; in patients with high tumor burdens or at risk of tumor lysis syndrome<\/li><li>hepatic function; in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.<\/li><li>blood glucose levels; in patients with diabetes taking oral antidiabetic agents.<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy; especially patients with preexisting symptoms<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of cardiac toxicity; particularly at-risk patients or patients with preexisting heart disease<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"927753-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Velcade<\/b><br\/>Injection Powder for Solution: 3.5 MG<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"927753-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"927753-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>BORTEZOMIB<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Limited data.
