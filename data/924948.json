PHARMACOLOGY: Orlistat, a reversible inhibitor of intestinal lipases, binds covalently with active serine residues of gastric and pancreatic lipases in the lumen of the stomach and intestine, making them unavailable to hydrolyze dietary triglycerides into absorbable fatty acids and monoglycerides. Because undigested triglycerides are not absorbed, a calorie deficit may occur, having a positive effect on weight control. Systemic absorption is minimal and is not needed for activity. A dose-dependent reduction in dietary fat absorption of up to approximately 30% is achieved with doses of 360 mg per day. TOXICOLOGY: Systemic effects of orlistat are minimal due to its very low oral absorption. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Limited data. Inadvertent exposure is anticipated to be an extension of adverse events reported with therapeutic use. In a retrospective chart review of 92 children (5 years of age or less) with minor exposures (120 mg or less) to orlistat alone, most children developed no effects or only minor clinical events; no serious events occurred. A 28-month-old girl ingested an estimated 5160 mg of over-the-counter orlistat and remained asymptomatic. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Gastrointestinal adverse effects (dose-related), including soft\/liquid stools, increased defecation, oily stools, flatulence, and fecal urgency or incontinence; reduction in serum levels of fat soluble vitamins, particularly vitamin E. OTHER EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, hemorrhoids, acute allergic reactions, elevated liver enzymes. Lichenoid drug eruption, myopathy, acute oxalate nephropathy, and depression have been reported in case reports; however, cause and effect relationships have not been established. In postmarketing evaluations, cases of severe liver injury, with hepatocellular necrosis or acute liver failure, have been rarely reported in patients who received orlistat. Causality could not be reliably established due to other medical conditions and concomitant use of other drugs that may have contributed to the development of liver injury in these patients. <br\/>"},{"id":"924948-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ORLISTAT <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

Significant toxicity is not expected after overdose of orlistat.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Orlistat is only minimally absorbed following oral ingestions; prehospital decontamination is generally NOT required.

Based on limited data, young children (5 years of age or less) with an inadvertent exposure and only mild symptoms (self limited vomiting or diarrhea) can be safely managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions or with more than mild symptoms should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924948-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ORLISTAT<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Limited data.
