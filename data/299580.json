It is used in neonates for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus. PHARMACOLOGY: Inhibits cyclooxygenases, COX1 and COX2. This results in the decreased synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxane A2, and decreased pain and inflammation. TOXICOLOGY: GI:  Indomethacin is a direct GI irritant, and the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis interferes with the maintenance of the GI barrier. Inhibition of thromboxane A2 in platelets prolongs bleeding time and predisposes to GI bleeding. RENAL: Decreases in prostaglandins I2 and E2, which have vasodilatory and natriuretic effects in the kidney that can lead to salt and water retention, and renal failure. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, and mild abdominal pain may develop. SEVERE TOXICITY: CNS disorientation, mental confusion, and lethargy have been reported. Upper GI bleeding and acute renal failure are also possible. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, gastritis, GI ulceration with perforation and hemorrhage, frontal headache, LESS COMMON: Dizziness, vertigo, stupor, hypersensitivity reactions, renal insufficiency, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia. <br\/>"},{"id":"299580-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>INDOMETHACIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treat GI distress and administer IV fluids.

HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal after large, recent overdose if the patient is alert and can protect the airway.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose or more than mild symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. If symptoms resolve over 4 to 6 hours, there is no evidence of GI bleeding and laboratory evaluation is normal, the patient discharged home. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant systemic signs and symptoms (hematologic disorders such as pancytopenia, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, renal failure, and significant electrolyte disturbances, or GI hemorrhage) should be admitted and receive appropriate supportive care.

Severity of intoxication should be based on clinical findings. Doses of 0.2 to 3.75 mg\/kg have resulted in toxic GI symptoms in pre-term infants. Doses up to 175 mg in children and 1500 mg in adults have been tolerated with minor symptoms. Transient renal failure with oliguria, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia developed in a preterm infant who received 20 mg\/kg of indomethacin intramuscularly. In a  series of 4 infants who inadvertently received a 10 fold overdose (1 mg\/kg), two developed transient increases in BUN or creatinine and three had decreased urine output, but no severe toxicity developed. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: The usual therapeutic dose is 25 to 50 mg 3 to 4 times a day.
