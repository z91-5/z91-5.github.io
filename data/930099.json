PHARMACOLOGY: Axitinib is a kinase inhibitor shown to inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3) implicated in angiogenesis and tumor growth leading to cancer progression. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Dizziness, hypertension, seizures associated with hypertension, and fatal hemoptysis occurred in patients who received axitinib orally at doses up to 20 mg twice daily during clinical trials. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse effects include diarrhea (55%), hypertension (40%), fatigue (39%), decreased appetite (34%), nausea (32%), dysphonia (31%), hand-foot syndrome (27%), decreased weight (25%), vomiting (24%), asthenia (21%), and constipation (20%). LESS FREQUENT: Other adverse effects that have occurred less frequently include, hypothyroidism, cough, mucosal inflammation, arthralgia, stomatitis, dyspnea, abdominal pain, headache, rash, proteinuria, dysgeusia, dry skin, dyspepsia, pruritus, alopecia, and erythema.<br\/>"},{"id":"930099-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AXITINIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For severe hypertension with end organ effects, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients who are awake and able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain their airway or if the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect their airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor liver enzymes and thyroid function tests. Monitor complete blood count (CBC) including differential and platelet count. Monitor for bleeding; monitor for clinical evidence of thromboembolic events. Monitor vital signs. Severe hypertension has been reported with therapeutic use and in overdose. Monitor urinalysis; proteinuria has been reported with therapeutic use. Serum axitinib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (greater than 99%).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of one or two extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, any patient who is symptomatic or ingested more than 2 extra doses, should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe hypertension or bleeding should be admitted to the hospital.
