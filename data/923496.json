Riluzole has also been studied in the treatment of depression, cervical dystonia and Huntington's disease. PHARMACOLOGY: Riluzole, a 2-amino-6-trifluoromethoxy benzothiazole, is a neuroprotective agent. The mode of action of riluzole is unknown. The pharmacological properties of riluzole include: an inhibitory effect on glutamate release; inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and ability to interfere with intracellular events that follow transmitter binding at excitatory amino acid receptors. Pharmacokinetics appear to be linear. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is uncommon. OVERDOSE: Overdose ingestions have resulted in methemoglobinemia and severe cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptoms may be an extension of adverse events. The following events appear to be dose-related: asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, vomiting and circumoral paraesthesia were dose-related. SEVERE TOXICITY: Toxic encephalopathy with stupor and coma, and methemoglobinemia have been reported in isolated cases following overdose. ADVERSE EVENTS: Therapeutic administration of glutamate antagonists may cause dose-related adverse effects including: decreased lung function, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, dizziness, somnolence, circumoral paresthesias and elevated liver enzymes. Hypertension and neutropenia are less common occurrences following therapeutic administration of riluzole.<br\/>"},{"id":"923496-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>GLUTAMATE ANTAGONISTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor fluid status in patients with significant gastrointestinal loss; treat with IV fluids and antiemetics as needed. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. Sedative agents such as benzodiazepines may be helpful in treating hypertension and tachycardia in agitated patients. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive; limited overdose data. Monitor neurologic function (events have been infrequent); overdose symptoms have included toxic encephalopathy, stupor and coma. Patients with a persistent fever should be evaluated for neutropenia. Methemoglobinemia has occurred infrequently following overdose; monitor methemoglobin as indicated. Treat with methylene blue.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is alert and able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting and is able to maintain their airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support or management is unlikely to be necessary following a mild to moderate exposure; patients with significant toxicity (ie, neurologic toxicity) may require mechanical intubation and ventilation.<\/li><li>Hypertensive episode: Monitor blood pressure regularly. For mild\/moderate hypertension without evidence of end organ damage, pharmacologic intervention is generally not necessary. Sedative agents such as benzodiazepines may be helpful in treating hypertension and tachycardia in agitated patients.<\/li><li>Methemoglobinemia: Use methylene blue and supplemental oxygen for symptomatic patients with methemoglobinemia (usually methemoglobin levels above 20% to 30%, may occur at lower levels with anemia, or underlying pulmonary\/cardiovascular disorders). METHYLENE BLUE (ADULT or CHILD): 1 to 2 mg\/kg\/dose IV over 5 minutes with a 30 mL flush of normal saline as needed every 4 hours.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Blood pressure should be monitored in symptomatic patients. Serum transaminase levels should be monitored after a significant overdose. Monitor methemoglobin concentration after a significant overdose. Monitor CBC with differential as necessary.<\/li><li>Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of benefit due to the high protein binding (96%) of riluzole.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child with an inadvertent exposure (a single dose) can be managed at home with adult supervision. An adult with an inadvertent exposure of an extra dose can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"923496-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>GLUTAMATE ANTAGONISTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose has not been established.
