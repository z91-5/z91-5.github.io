C1 inhibitor also regulates the fibrinolytic system. It is hypothesized that increased vascular permeability and the clinical manifestation of hereditary angioedema attacks are primarily mediated through contact system activation. Suppression of contact system activation by C1 inhibitor through the inactivation of plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa is thought to modulate this vascular permeability by preventing the generation of bradykinin.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"929218-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"929218-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Tmax, IV: 3.9 hours <br\/>"},"1":{"id":"929218-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: 0.43 dL\/kg <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"929218-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Total body clearance: 0.85 mL\/min; 0.92 mL\/kg\/hr <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"929218-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"32.7 hours  to 56 hours <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"929218-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>(Berinert(R)) allow vial and diluent to come to room temperature prior to reconstitution<\/li><li>(Berinert(R)) reconstitute with 10 mL of provided diluent (sterile water for injection) via provided transfer set (Mix2Vial(TM)) or other commercially available double-ended needle and vented filter spike; push spike at blue end of MIX2Vial(TM) transfer set firmly through center of diluent stopper; invert the diluent vial and push the spike into the Berinert(R) vial; vacuum in product vial will draw in diluent<\/li><li>(Berinert(R)) gently swirl vial and diluent while still attached to transfer set; do not shake vial<\/li><li>(Berinert(R)) remove transfer set and withdraw appropriate dose from vial with syringe; multiple vials may be pooled in a single syringe; use separate transfer set for each vial<\/li><li>(Berinert(R)) do not refrigerate or freeze after reconstitution; store solution at room temperature (25 degrees C or 77 degrees F) and use within 8 hours<\/li><li>(Berinert(R)) final concentration after reconstitution is 50 units\/mL<\/li><li>(Berinert(R)) administer reconstituted solution by slow IV injection at a rate of 4 mL\/min<\/li><li>(Berinert(R)) do not mix with other medications and administer through a separate infusion line<\/li><li>(Cinryze(R)) allow vial to come to room temperature, before or after reconstitution and prior to administration<\/li><li>(Cinryze(R)) two vials are required for 1 total dose<\/li><li>(Cinryze(R)) reconstitute with 5 mL of sterile water for injection via a transfer needle to a concentration of 100 units\/mL; vacuum in product vial will draw in diluent; do not use if no vacuum is evident<\/li><li>(Cinryze(R)) gently swirl vial until all product is reconstituted<\/li><li>(Cinryze(R)) product must be administered at room temperature no later than 3 hours after reconstitution; discard unused portion<\/li><li>(Cinryze(R)) administer reconstituted solution IV at an initial infusion rate of 1 mL\/min over 10 minutes<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"929218-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>reduction in number, severity, and duration of swelling attacks associated with hereditary angioedema is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of thrombosis; in patients with known risk factors.<\/li><li>symptoms of hypersensitivity during or after infusion<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"929218-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Berinert<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 500 U<br\/><\/li><li><b>Cinryze<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 500 U<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"929218-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Advise patient who self-administers the drug to seek immediate medical attention in an appropriate healthcare facility following drug administration for an acute laryngeal attack or suspected abdominal attack.<\/li><li>Despite screening and testing, human plasma products carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents.
