Because of this process,  mupirocin does not demonstrate in vitro  cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents .<\/li><li>The type of mupirocin resistance that may occur appears to result from the production of a modified isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] &gt; 1024 mcg per mL) has been reported in some strains of Staphylococcus aureus  and coagulase-negative staphylococci .<\/li><li>Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical intranasal administration. However, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against relevant intranasal pathogens is generally eightfold to thirty-fold higher than the MIC. In addition, mupirocin is highly protein-bound, and the effect of nasal secretions on the MIC of intranasal mupirocin has not been determined .<\/li><li>Mupirocin has been shown to be active against most strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, both in vitro  and in clinical studies of the eradication of nasal colonization.<\/li><li>Topical: The mechanism of action is not completely understood. Mupirocin is bacteriostatic at low concentrations and bactericidal at high concentrations. This agent reversibly and specifically binds to bacterial isoleucyl transfer RNA synthetase, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein and RNA synthesis. DNA synthesis and cell wall formation are affected to a lesser extent. <\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"386330-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"386330-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Nasal: 3.3% (range 1.2 to 5.1%)   <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"386330-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Nasal: Renal <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"386330-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Nasal:  20 to 40 min (males) <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"386330-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Topical<\/b><br\/><ul><li>may cover treated areas with gauze dressings if desired<\/li><li>avoid contact with eyes<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"386330-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>clearing of infected skin.<\/li><li>re-evaluate patients who have not shown a clinical response within 3 to 5 days of starting therapy (cream or ointment).<\/li><li>evidence of sensitization or severe local irritation.<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"386330-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Topical Ointment: 2 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Bactroban<\/b><br\/>Topical Ointment: 2 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Centany AT<\/b><br\/>Topical Ointment: 2 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Centany<\/b><br\/>Topical Ointment: 2 %<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"386330-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Tell patient to contact a healthcare professional if condition has not improved after 3 to 5 days.<\/li><li>Side effects may include burning, stinging, pain, dry skin, swelling, or tenderness.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report irritation, severe itching, or rash.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to avoid contact with eyes and to rinse thoroughly with water if accidental contact occurs.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
