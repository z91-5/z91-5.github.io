Hydrocodone may be abused for euphoric effects by multiple routes (i.e., injection, insufflation, ingestion). It is available in combination products with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and mucolytics\/expectorants. It is also available as a sustained release formulation. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is fairly common, particularly in patients with chronic opioid abuse, and may be life threatening. PHARMACOLOGY: Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic derivative of codeine, that binds at the opiate receptor. TOXICOLOGY: Therapeutic and toxic effects are mediated by different opioid receptors. Mu 1: Supraspinal and peripheral analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Mu 2: Spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, physical dependence, GI dysmotility, bradycardia and pruritus. Kappa 1: Spinal analgesia and miosis. Kappa 2: Dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Kappa 3: Supraspinal analgesia. Chronic opioid users develop tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects, but not to the respiratory depression effects. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Euphoria, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting and pinpoint pupils. Mild bradycardia or hypotension may be present. SEVERE POISONING: Respiratory depression leading to apnea, hypoxia, coma, bradycardia, or acute lung injury. Rarely, seizures may develop from hypoxia. Death may result from any of these complications.<br\/><\/li><li><b>IBUPROFEN <\/b><br\/>USES: Ibuprofen is used for fever and pain control and for the treatment of several rheumatologic conditions. PHARMACOLOGY: Ibuprofen inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme, leading to decreased prostaglandin production and decreased pain and inflammation. TOXICOLOGY: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are due to both local irritant effects and the inhibition of prostaglandins (PG), which are responsible in part for maintaining the GI mucosal barrier. Inhibition of thromboxane A2 production in platelets prolongs bleeding time and contributes to gastrointestinal bleeding. Inhibition of PGI2 and PGE2, which have vasodilatory and natriuretic activity in the kidney, can be linked to sodium and water retention and occasional acute renal failure. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is common; however, severe toxicity is very rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In general, patients are asymptomatic or have mild GI upset (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain). Mild CNS depression (drowsiness, lethargy) and headache are common (incidence up to 30%). Nystagmus, diplopia, headache, tinnitus, and transient deafness may also occur following overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: With massive overdose, seizure, coma, acute renal failure, and, very rarely, cardiopulmonary arrest may occur. Upper GI bleeding may occur after acute or chronic ingestion. Elevated liver enzymes, hypoprothrombinemia, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia (associated with renal failure), hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, dyspnea, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation have also been observed in overdose. Transient episodes of apnea have been reported in young children following large ingestions. Acute pancreatitis has been reported. ONSET: Symptoms typically occur within 4 to 6 hours of ingestion. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Gastrointestinal distress, nausea, and epigastric pain are the most common findings; upper GI bleeding may occur after acute or chronic ingestion. Angioedema, hives, itching, rash, and swelling have also been reported with therapeutic use. Fluid retention, interstitial nephritis, nephritic syndrome, and acute renal failure can develop. Hematologic effects include agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Headache, asthma exacerbation, aseptic meningitis, delirium, and anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jt8ts12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>HYDROCODONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Naloxone is the antidote indicated for severe toxicity (respiratory or CNS depression). Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital GI decontamination is generally not indicated because of the risk of CNS depression and aspiration. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if a patient presents soon after an ingestion and is not manifesting signs and symptoms of toxicity. Activated charcoal is generally not recommended in patients with significant signs of toxicity because of the risk of aspiration. Gastric lavage is not recommended as patients usually do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and assist ventilation for respiratory depression. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of obtundation and\/or respiratory depression that do not respond to naloxone, or in patients who develop severe acute lung injury.<\/li><li>Antidote: NALOXONE, an opioid antagonist, is the specific antidote. Naloxone can be given intravascularly, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally or endotracheally. The usual dose is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV. In patients with suspected opioid dependence incremental doses of 0.2 mg IV should be administered, titrated to reversal of respiratory depression and coma, to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal. Doses may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes up to 20 mg. Very high doses are rarely needed, but may occasionally be necessary. A CONTINUOUS infusion may be necessary in patients that have ingested a large overdose or sustained release formulation. A suggested starting rate is two-thirds of the dose effective for initial reversal that is administered each hour; titrate as needed. DURATION of effect is usually 1-2 hours. Hydrocodone has a longer duration of effect, so it is necessary to observe the patient at least 3-4 hours after the last dose of naloxone to ensure that the patient does not have recurrent symptoms of toxicity. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal in an opioid-dependent patients, which is usually not life-threatening; however it can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are very rare, but may be a result of hypoxia. Treatment includes ensuring adequate oxygenation, and administering intravenous benzodiazepines; propofol or barbiturates may be indicated, if seizures persist.<\/li><li>Acute lung injury: Acute lung injury can develop in a small proportion of patients after an acute opioid overdose, although there are no specific reports after hydrocodone overdose. The pathophysiology is unclear. Patients should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after overdose to evaluate for hypoxia and\/or the development of acute lung injury. Continuous oxygen therapy, pulse oximetry, PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension is often reversed by naloxone. Initially treat with a saline bolus, if patient can tolerate a fluid load; then adrenergic vasopressors to raise mean arterial pressure.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs frequently, pulse oximetry, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression. Hydrocodone plasma levels are not clinically useful or readily available. Urine toxicology screens may confirm exposure, but are rarely useful in guiding therapy. Obtain a four hour acetaminophen and salicylate levels in a patient with a suspected overdose. Other routine lab work is usually not indicated, unless it is helpful to rule out other causes or if the diagnosis of hydrocodone toxicity is uncertain. Obtain a chest x-ray for persistent hypoxia. Consider a head CT and\/or lumbar puncture to rule out an intracranial mass, bleeding or infection, if the diagnosis is uncertain.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not of value.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Respiratory depression may occur at doses just above a therapeutic dose, particularly in young children or those with underlying respiratory compromise. Children should be evaluated in the hospital and observed as they are generally opioid naive and may develop respiratory depression. Adults should be evaluated by a health care professional if they have received a higher than recommended (therapeutic) dose, especially if opioid naive. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions or who are symptomatic, or any pediatric ingestion above the therapeutic dose for age and weight should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment.  IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Observation for at least 4 hours, to ensure that peak plasma levels have been reached and there has been sufficient time for symptoms to develop. Patients who are treated with naloxone should be observed for 4 to 6 hours after the last dose, for recurrent CNS depression or acute lung injury. EXTENDED RELEASE: Observe for at least 7 to 12 hours (at therapeutic doses, Tmax for extended-release hydrocodone is 5 hours; for combination chlorpheniramine products: Tmax is 3.4 hours).  Peak concentrations are expected to be delayed after overdose, and symptoms may be delayed or prolonged. Patients who develop even moderate opioid effects or who require naloxone after ingestion of an extended-release product should be admitted. ADMISSION CRITERIA: IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Patients with significant, persistent central nervous system depression should be admitted to the hospital. A patient needing more than 2 doses of naloxone should be admitted as additional doses may be needed. Patients with coma, seizures, dysrhythmias, delirium, and those needing a naloxone infusion or who are intubated should be admitted to an intensive care setting. EXTENDED RELEASE: Patients who develop even moderate opioid effects or who require naloxone after ingestion of an extended-release product should be admitted.
