Apixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulant used to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. PHARMACOLOGY: Rivaroxaban and apixaban provide anticoagulation by selective inhibition of factor Xa without the need of a cofactor (eg, anti-thrombin III) for activity. TOXICOLOGY: Inhibition of factor Xa in humans with rivaroxaban is dose-dependent. Excessive neutralization of factor Xa may cause clinically significant bleeding. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare for these agents. OVERDOSE: The main effect of rivaroxaban and apixaban in overdose is hemorrhage. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The main complication of rivaroxaban and apixaban therapy is serious bleeding that can be fatal. The following adverse effects for rivaroxaban have rarely been reported: pruritus, blister, pain in extremity, muscle spasm, thrombocytopenia, hypersensitivity reactions, and syncope. In postmarketing evaluation, the following adverse effects have also been reported: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hemiparesis, cerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, jaundice, cholestasis, cytolytic hepatitis, and agranulocytosis. Causal relationship could not be established. An elderly patient developed cardiac tamponade following rivaroxaban (20 mg daily) therapy. DRUG INTERACTION: Concurrent administration of rivaroxaban or apixaban with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, lopinavir\/ritonavir, indinavir\/ritonavir, and conivaptan) can increase rivaroxaban or apixaban exposure significantly and increase bleeding risk.<br\/>"},{"id":"jxuxs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RIVAROXABAN AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a recent potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain their airway or if the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Assess airway; endotracheal intubation may be required in patients with intracranial bleeding or severe hemoptysis or upper GI bleeding.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor for evidence of bleeding (eg, venous access sites, urinary, gastrointestinal, vaginal). Monitor serial hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients with suspected bleeding. Monitor CBC with platelet count, vital signs, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT are relatively insensitive in measuring the activity of rivaroxaban at therapeutic doses, but may be prolonged after overdose. Plasma anti-factor Xa concentrations can be measured, but results are generally not available rapidly enough to use this to guide therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Rivaroxaban is highly protein bound and dialysis is not expected to adequately to be useful after overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME MANAGEMENT: Patients that unintentionally ingest one or two doses of oral rivaroxaban may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Intentional overdoses and patients with bleeding complications should be referred to a healthcare facility. Patients with minor bleeding complications can be observed until the bleeding is controlled. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with more than minor bleeding complications should be admitted for serial hemoglobin and hematocrit monitoring. CONSULT CRITERIA: If the patient still requires anticoagulation, hematology should be consulted for anticoagulation guidance.
