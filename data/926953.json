Manual injection of this syringe would result in an overdose.<\/li><li>Neulasta(R) delivery kit: Do not shake. Keep kit refrigerated until ready to use; discard kit if stored at room temperature for more than 12 hours.<\/li><li>On-body injector: Insert the prefilled syringe at a 90-degree angle and fill the medicine port with the entire contents of the syringe. During filling, a beeping sound and an amber light signifies activation of the system and deployment of the cannula in 3 minutes, even if not applied to the patient. If not attached to the patient within 3 minutes, discard the on-body injector and apply a new kit.<\/li><li>On-body injector: Ensure the on-body injector is full and lift the blue needle cover away from the injector. Remove the 2 white pieces of backing from the adhesive pad. Apply vertically with the light facing down toward the elbow to intact, nonirritated skin on the flattest site on the back of the arm (if caregiver monitoring is available), or horizontally on the abdomen (except for the 2-inch area surrounding the navel) with the light facing the navel. Once applied, run a finger around the adhesive pad to ensure attachment.<\/li><li>On-body injector: Avoid areas with scar tissue, moles, or excessive hair. Keep the on-body injector dry for the last 3 hours prior to delivery of the dose to better detect leakage. Avoid direct sunlight and the use of lotions, cream, oils, cleaning agents, hot tubs, whirlpools, and saunas while wearing the on-body injector.<\/li><li>On-body injector: Keep the on-body injector at least 4 inches away from electrical equipment (eg, cordless or cell phones, microwaves, other appliances) and do not expose to medical imaging equipment (X-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound) and oxygen-rich environments (eg, hyperbaric chamber).<\/li><li>On-body injector: A beeping sound signifies that dose delivery will begin in 2 minutes.

They are also used to reduce the period of neutropenia in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. In addition, filgrastim and sargramostim are used to mobilize peripheral blood cells for use as an alternative to bone marrow transplantation. PHARMACOLOGY: Colony stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors which can stimulate proliferation, differentiation, commitment, and end cell functional activation. TOXICOLOGY: Because colony stimulating factors can increase absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and result in a corresponding increase in WBC, leukocytosis may occur. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Data are limited. Clinical events are anticipated to be an extension of adverse events reported with these agents. In a small clinical study, doses of up to 100 mcg\/kg\/day of sargramostim (16 times the recommended dose) produced dyspnea, malaise, nausea, fever, rash, sinus tachycardia, headache and chills. Leukocytosis and bone pain were reported following inadvertent self-administration of pegfilgrastim IV 36 mg, instead of the prescribed 6 mg. ADVERSE EVENTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, bone pain and influenza-like symptoms are frequently reported with these agents. Other potential events that have been reported include: drug fever, hematologic events (ie, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia), peripheral edema, fluid retention, pulmonary edema (sargramostim), pleural effusion (sargramostim), rash, elevations in serum creatinine and BUN. SERIOUS: Potentially serious events reported with colony stimulating factors include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), splenic rupture (rare), and severe sickle cell crisis in patients with a history of sickle cell disease. SARGRAMOSTIM: A \"first-dose\" reaction following intravenous therapy has been characterized by tachycardia, respiratory distress, hypoxia, hypotension and syncope. Dyspnea and transient hypotension have also been reported infrequently with filgrastim therapy.<br\/>"},{"id":"926953-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>COLONY STIMULATING FACTORS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Assess bone pain and administer analgesics as indicated. Begin with non-narcotics (ie, acetaminophen); narcotics may be required in some patients. Monitor ECG and consider continuous cardiac monitoring following a significant overdose. Sinus tachycardia does not generally require treatment unless hemodynamic compromise develops. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.  Treat severe hypotension IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Unlikely to be necessary; these agents are administered parenterally.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions or respiratory compromise.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count following exposure, and continue until WBC normalizes (may remain elevated for up to two weeks). Monitor renal function and liver enzymes. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Elevations in uric acid levels have occurred with filgrastim therapy; evaluate as needed. Monitor ECG and consider continuous cardiac monitoring following a significant overdose. Chest x-ray is indicated if pulmonary toxicity is suspected. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  There is no data to support home management, and colony stimulating factors are generally only used in the hospital setting. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926953-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>COLONY STIMULATING FACTORS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Limited data.
