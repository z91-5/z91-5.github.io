DAUNOrubicin citrate liposome is used as a first-line cytotoxic therapy for advanced HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. PHARMACOLOGY: DAUNOrubicin hydrochloride is an antimitotic, antitumor and cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic derived from the strain of Streptomyces coeruleorubidus. It intercalates between base pairs to form complexes with DNA. It maintains the stability of DNA-topoisomerase II complex which prevents topoisomerase II from catalyzing the religation part of the ligation-religation reaction leading to single and double strand DNA breaks. It also blocks polymerase activity, affects regulation of gene expression and produces free radical damage to DNA. Liposomal DAUNOrubicin is a liposomal preparation of DAUNOrubicin formulated to maximize the selectivity of DAUNOrubicin for solid tumors in situ. TOXICOLOGY: DAUNOrubicin interferes with DNA replication in rapidly dividing cells, such as bone marrow and gastrointestinal epithelium. Cardiac toxicity of DAUNOrubicin may be related to free radical production. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, and myelosuppression may occur following DAUNOrubicin overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe myelosuppression (especially granulocytopenia), acute cardiomyopathy (ie, ECG changes, dysrhythmias, hypotension, heart failure), severe mucositis, vomiting, and diarrhea may develop. INTRATHECAL INJECTION: Severe neurotoxicity (cerebral atrophy) and death have been reported after unintentional intrathecal administration of DAUNOrubicin. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The acute or subacute cardiotoxicity can develop within 1 to 23 days after the last dose of DAUNOrubicin.  Manifestations can include conduction or rhythm disturbances (ie, tachycardia, supraventricular dysrhythmias, heart block) and abnormal ECG findings (nonspecific ST-T changes). A significant decrease in ejection fraction has been documented 24 to 48 hours after drug administration. DAUNOrubicin can also cause cumulative (lifetime), dose-dependent cardiomyopathy as a result of direct endomyocardial tissue damage.  It is characterized by irreversible congestive heart failure, the mortality rate ranges from 50% to 80%. Bone marrow suppression is the acute dose-limiting toxicity. The following adverse effects have also been reported following therapeutic doses of DAUNOrubicin: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis\/mucositis, constipation, abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, fever, cough, dyspnea, rhinitis, sinusitis, headache, rigors, acute allergic reactions, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, diaphoresis, neuropathy, edema, chest pain, malaise, alopecia, dizziness, pruritus, and abnormal vision. Severe local tissue necrosis, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, or painful induration may develop if extravasation occurs during therapy with DAUNOrubicin.<br\/>"},{"id":"jsnks12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DAUNORUBICIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor for signs of congestive heart failure. Administer dexrazoxane to prevent cardiomyopathy. Treat nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor for signs of congestive heart failure. Dexrazoxane should be used for the prophylaxis of cardiomyopathy and to treat extravasation. Treat patients with heart failure with diuretics, vasodilators, ACE inhibitors, and inotropic agents as indicated. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Inadvertent intrathecal injection has been reported with DAUNOrubicin, resulting in severe neurotoxicity and death. After an overdose,  keep the patient upright and immediately drain at least 20 mL of CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free saline). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 24 hours). Add fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP per liter NS or LR) or 5% albumin to the perfusate to increase elimination as DAUNOrubicin is highly protein bound. Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Decontamination is not necessary in most situations as DAUNOrubicin is administered IV. For dermal exposures, clean skin with soap and water, and for eye exposures, flush with water.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect airway or if unstable dysrhythmias develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote, but dexrazoxane should be administered as soon as possible if the dose administered puts the patient at risk for delayed cardiomyopathy, or if extravasation has occurred.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, generally these are most effective in preventing nausea and vomiting, and are less effective than dopamine agonists), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: Withdraw as much solution as possible from the catheter before it is removed. Administer dexrazoxane 1000 mg\/m(2) infused intravenously using a different venous access site over 1 to 2 hours on day 1 (MAX, 2000 mg) within 6 hours of extravasation. Repeat the same dose 24 +\/- 3 hours after extravasation on day 2 (MAX, 2000 mg) followed by a 500 mg\/m(2) dose 48 +\/- 3 hours after extravasation on day 3 (MAX, 1000 mg). Severe injury may require debridement.<\/li><li>Dexrazoxane: Dexrazoxane is used to prevent cardiomyopathy at therapeutic doses. There is no published clinical experience after overdose, but it should be administered as soon as possible if the DAUNOrubicin overdose is recognized early. If the DAUNOrubicin overdose is not recognized early, there is probably little benefit to administering dexrazoxane.  The usual dose of dexrazoxane to prevent cardiomyopathy is 10 times the doxorubicin dose (ie, 500 mg\/m(2) dexrazoxane for a 50 mg\/m(2) dose of doxorubicin). Additive myelosuppression generally occurs at dexrazoxane doses above 1000 mg\/m(2), so doses larger than this should generally be avoided. For extravasation, the initial dose is 1000 mg\/m(2) infused over 1 to 2 hours on day 1 (MAX, 2000 mg) and should be given within 6 hours of extravasation. Repeat the same dose 24 +\/- 3 hours after extravasation on day 2 (MAX, 2000 mg) followed by a 500 mg\/m(2) dose 48 +\/- 3 hours after extravasation on day 3 (MAX, 1000 mg).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics (eg, morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, fentanyl). Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with a DAUNOrubicin overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Dose-dependent myelosuppression is the most frequent and severe toxicity associated with DAUNOrubicin. It manifests primarily as leukopenia, reaching a nadir towards the end of the second week of therapy and recovering by the end of the third week. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of mucositis. Monitor vital signs and serial ECGs; institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Evaluate for evidence of cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram or radionucleotide studies may be useful. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic enzymes. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of mucositis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis is UNLIKELY to be of benefit due to high protein binding and large volume of distribution. Plasma exchange would be expected to remove significant amounts of liposomal DAUNOrubicin if performed soon after overdose, but there are no clinical reports of use of this technique.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), cardiac function, and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with DAUNOrubicin overdose. Consult a cardiologist to manage patients with heart failure. May require surgical consult for extravasation. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jsnks12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>DAUNORUBICIN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Total cumulative doses of greater than 400 to 550 mg\/m(2) in adults, 300 mg\/m(2) in children greater than 2 years, and 10 mg\/kg in children under 2 years of age have resulted in an increase in incidence of myocardial toxicity, including fatal congestive heart failure.
