<\/b><br\/>USES: Ibutilide fumarate is used for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of recent onset to sinus rhythm. PHARMACOLOGY: Ibutilide for injection is an antiarrhythmic drug with predominantly class III (cardiac potential prolongation) properties. It delays repolarization by activation of a slow, inward current (predominantly sodium), leading to a prolongation of atrial and ventricular action potential duration and refractory periods. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose experience is limited.  Effects reported include nausea, QT prolongation, ventricular ectopy, ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, and complete heart block. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea has been reported in ibutilide-treated patients with twice the incidence of controls. TORSADES de POINTES: Ibutilide may induce or worsen ventricular dysrhythmias, producing life threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Patients with a history of torsades de pointes, prolonged QTc (greater than 440 msec), and serum potassium below 4.0 mEq\/L are at increased risk of developing ventricular dysrhythmias. <br\/>"},{"id":"923552-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>IBUTILIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat patients with torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate; correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary. Treat other dysrhythmias using standard ACLS protocols.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not necessary as ibutilide is administered intravenously.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia). Lidocaine may be used if dysrhythmias persist.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Therapeutic doses of ibutilide may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of ibutilide and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, atrial overdrive pacing may be necessary.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULTS: 1 to 2 g IV (mixed in 50 to 100 mL D5W) infused over 5 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILDREN: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Rates of 100 to 120 beats\/min may terminate torsades. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs. Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor serum electrolytes, including potassium and  magnesium (correct underlying abnormalities).<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Although no studies report the use of dialysis, it is unlikely to remove significant amounts of ibutilide because of its large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management, and ibutilide is generally only used in the hospital setting.  OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with ibutilide overdose should be observed in an ICU setting with continuous ECG monitoring and frequent monitoring of vital signs. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted to an intensive care setting for further observation.
