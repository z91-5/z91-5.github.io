PHARMACOLOGY: Ramelteon, a hypnotic, is a melatonin receptor agonist with high affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and selectivity over the MT3 receptor. The MT1 and MT2 receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are believed to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle; therefore, the activity of ramelteon at these receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties. TOXICOLOGY: Ramelteon acts as a hypnotic and may produce cognitive and behavioral changes in individuals. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is not common. Significant toxicity is not anticipated with ramelteon-only ingestions. OVERDOSE: Limited data. Doses up to 400 mg have resulted in mild to moderate effects in adults. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Events would be anticipated to be an extension of adverse events and include: somnolence, fatigue, dizziness and nausea. SEVERE TOXICITY: Potential adverse events may include drowsiness\/lethargy and possibly significant CNS depression, worsening of depression, hallucinations and potential for injury. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, nausea and headache have been the most frequently reported events with therapeutic administration. A worsening of insomnia and depression may occur with ramelteon. Some individuals have experienced \"sleep driving\" (driving while not being fully awake), or other behaviors (eg, preparing and eating food, making phone calls with no memory, or hallucinations. Severe anaphylaxis has been reported after receiving a first dose; patients should not be rechallenged. <br\/>"},{"id":"928423-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b> RAMELTEON <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Significant toxicity is not anticipated; drowsiness is likely to occur. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Drowsiness\/lethargy is likely to occur; significant CNS depression may develop, especially if coingested with other agents. Monitor mental status; assess airway. Rare reports of cognitive disturbances have developed in some patients with therapy.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is not expected following overdose. Gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely indicated. HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is not expected following overdose. Gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely indicated. Activated charcoal may be indicated following a recent very large ingestion or if coingestions are suspected, if the patient is awake and alert and can protect the airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be necessary unless significant CNS depression occurs.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Ramelteon serum levels are not widely available or clinically useful in managing overdose. No routine laboratory tests are needed after overdose unless otherwise clinically indicated. Monitor vital signs and mental status in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not effective in reducing exposure to ramelteon, given its high protein binding of 82%.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A minor inadvertent exposure in an asymptomatic child (a single dose) or an extra dose in an adult can likely be monitored at home. In the case of a child, adequate supervision is necessary. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion or coingestion of other agents should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with more than a minor ingestion should be observed for possible symptoms. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any patient who develops significant persistent CNS depression or behavioral changes should be admitted for observation. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in cases of severe poisonings or in whom the diagnosis is unclear. Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated by a mental health specialist.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928423-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b> RAMELTEON <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
