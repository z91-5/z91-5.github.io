Benzoic acid in combination with salicylic acid has been used as an antifungal agent. Sodium benzoate in combination with sodium phenylacetate is approved as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia in adult and pediatric patients with urea cycle enzyme deficiencies. TOXICOLOGY: Benzoic acid is thought to inhibit oxidative enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, similar to salicylates, and may result in secondary lactic acid production. Metabolic acidosis may also be explained by a direct action of benzoic acid. Metabolism of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid is postulated as the mechanism for toxicity in premature infants. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Benzoate exposures are extremely common due to their frequent use as preservatives and buffering agents, however, significant toxicity is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The primary effect expected from ingestion of moderate amounts of benzoates is gastrointestinal irritation with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Benzoic acid is more irritating than benzoate salts. A non-immunologic contact dermatitis commonly occurs following dermal exposure. Renal tubular dysfunction and elevated free bilirubin levels may occur in a small number of cases. SEVERE TOXICITY: Large ingestions of benzoates may cause metabolic acidosis, elevated serum lactate levels, and associated tachypnea and Kussmaul respirations. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia may also occur. Administration of benzyl alcohol to neonates has been associated with metabolic acidosis and gasping respirations. Seizures have been reported in experimental animals.<br\/>"},{"id":"bwrzs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BENZOATES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment of mild to moderate toxicity consists of predominantly symptomatic and supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment for severe toxicity consists of predominantly symptomatic and supportive care. Treat severe metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.1) with sodium bicarbonate 1 to 2 mEq\/kg to maintain hemodynamic stability, however the long-term benefit of this treatment has not been shown. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines as needed; NOTE: diazepam IV contains 5% sodium benzoate and benzoic acid as buffering agents, therefore, an alternative benzodiazepine such as lorazepam or midazolam may be a better choice. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Dermal exposure commonly causes an acute non-immunologic contact urticaria. Urticaria typically occurs within 30 minutes of exposure, and is transient, lasting only 20 to 40 minutes. Administration of oral indomethacin has reportedly blocked this reaction. EYE EXPOSURE: Patients with persistent irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia after irrigation should have a thorough ophthalmologic exam, including slit lamp.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not generally recommended as acute toxicity is limited. Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed skin with soap and water. Irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of water. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not generally recommended as acute toxicity is limited. Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed skin with soap and water. Irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of 0.9% saline or water.<\/li><li>Airway management: Rarely, patients with marked CNS depression or acidosis may need intubation for respiratory support.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, liver enzymes, blood gases, and lactate levels in patients with evidence of toxicity. Institute cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG in patients with toxicity. Benzoate concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful for acute management.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Efficacy of enhanced elimination techniques is unknown. Hemodialysis may be useful to treat severe acidosis or in cases that develop renal failure.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with known large ingestions may be watched clinically for the development of toxicity such as gastrointestinal irritation and acidosis. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop gastrointestinal irritation or other signs of benzoate toxicity after a known exposure should be admitted to the hospital. Patients who develop evidence of severe toxicity with acidosis, tachypnea, altered mental status, or seizures should be admitted to an ICU. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact your local poison center for a toxicology consult for any patient with suspected benzoate toxicity and acidosis, seizures, or other end-organ toxicity.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"bwrzs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>BENZOATES<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULT: Ingestion of benzoic acid in amounts of 1 to 1.5 g in adults produced gastric pain, nausea, and vomiting; Sodium benzoate ingestions of up to 20 to 60 g daily have been tolerated. PEDIATRIC: 200 to 300 mg\/kg\/day orally, given to infants, caused lactic acidosis. Inadvertent oral administration of 800 mg\/kg of sodium benzoate over 24 hours to a neonate with hyperammonemia resulted in vomiting and irritability. Oral administration of 1000 mg\/kg\/day to a 5.5-month-old child with nonketotic hyperglycemia resulted in metabolic acidosis, renal tubular dysfunction, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. Anion gap metabolic acidosis, agitation, and tachypnea developed in 3 pediatric patients (ages ranging from 2 to 6 years) following inadvertent IV overdoses of sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate, ranging from 750 mg\/kg infused over 10 hours to 1750 mg\/kg infused over 18 hours. Despite aggressive supportive care, 2 of the 3 patients developed cerebral edema and died within hours.
