formulated into a salt used in medications for the treatment of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in surgical paste for ileostomies and colostomies, and as an adjunct in the treatment of ulcers. PHARMACOLOGY: The pharmacological mechanism of bismuth is not clear. It may have protective effects in the gastric mucosa and it inhibits the growth of H. pylori. TOXICOLOGY: Bismuth toxicity varies regarding both onset and type of toxicity due to the solubility of the salt form administered. Binds sulfhydryl groups, especially in the CNS, resulting in loss of white matter and specifically Purkinje cells and encephalopathy. Also causes degeneration of proximal tubules in the kidney, resulting in nephrotoxicity. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Ingestion of bismuth products is common, but toxicity from bismuth is rare and deaths have not been reported. MILD TO MODERATE POISONING: Can cause oral mucosal lesions, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Chronic use can cause discoloration of the skin, oral, or vaginal mucosa. SEVERE POISONING: Chronic intoxication can cause encephalopathy which can manifest as mental status changes, such as memory loss, confusion, delirium, psychosis, depression, insomnia, difficulty in concentration, ataxia, tremors, myoclonus, and seizures. Acute renal failure has been reported after large ingestions.<br\/><\/li><li><b>METRONIDAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/>USES: Metronidazole is a synthetic 5-nitroimidazole compound. Secnidazole and tinidazole are related compounds and are long-acting 5-nitroimidazole derivatives. These drugs have antiprotozoal and antibacterial activity and are used in the treatment of protozoal and anaerobic bacterial infections. Metronidazole and tinidazole are used for the treatment of trichomoniasis, amebic liver abscesses, intestinal amebiasis, pelvic inflammatory disease, bacterial vaginosis, giardiasis, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, as well as for perioperative prophylaxis. Secnidazole is used to treat giardiasis, intestinal amebiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis, but secnidazole is not currently available in the United States. PHARMACOLOGY: These chemicals are reduced in a process unique to anaerobic metabolism; the short-lived metabolite disrupts DNA and inhibits nucleic acid synthesis. TOXICOLOGY: Mechanism is not known. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Metronidazole is commonly prescribed. Acute toxicity is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: METRONIDAZOLE: Most patients remain asymptomatic. Dark (green\/black) urine and increased liver enzymes have been reported. TINIDAZOLE: At the time of this review, there are no reports of human overdose with tinidazole. SEVERE TOXICITY: CNS depression and seizures have been reported rarely. Dizziness, diplopia, disorientation, ataxia, and sensory neuropathy have been reported with chronic overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: METRONIDAZOLE: Characteristic adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and vertigo. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported in children receiving chronic therapy. Leukopenia has been reported in approximately 1% of patients receiving therapeutic dosing. In 2 patients, sensorineural hearing loss occurred within 48 hours of use. An expected reaction in a patient who takes metronidazole and drinks ethanol is a disulfiram-like reaction; patients taking these agents should avoid ingestion of ethanol during treatment and for 3 days after cessation of treatment. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, flushing, anxiety, confusion, vertigo, and headache may occur. In severe reactions, patients may become hypotensive. TINIDAZOLE: Overall the adverse effects reported with tinidazole are similar to those of metronidazole. In clinical studies, adverse effects were mild and self-limited with therapy.<br\/><\/li><li><b>TETRACYCLINES<\/b><br\/>USES: Tetracyclines are used in the treatment of a wide variety of gram-negative and gram-positive infections. PHARMACOLOGY: Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic and exert their antimicrobial effects by inhibition of protein synthesis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is relatively common. However, severe toxicity is not observed. Anaphylaxis can develop during therapeutic use in some individuals. OVERDOSE:  Severe toxicity following acute overdosage is unlikely.  MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea and vomiting are common following overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypersensitivity reactions can develop with therapy in the form of various skin rashes along with more severe reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis. ADVERSE EFFECTS:  COMMON: Nausea and vomiting with therapeutic use. Epigastric burning and ulceration may also occur. Skin hyperpigmentation may develop. Renal dysfunction, including elevated BUN, may occur due to the antianabolic activity of tetracyclines. DEMECLOCYCLINE: A diabetes insipidus syndrome has been reported following demeclocycline. CHRONIC EFFECTS: Chronic ingestion of therapeutic doses can cause discoloration and enamel defects in the teeth of the fetus if used after the 12th week of pregnancy or in infants during the first 6 to 8 months of life.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928788-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>BISMUTH <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TOXICITY: Treat nausea and vomiting with antiemetics and fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is rare after acute ingestion. Chronic toxicity may produce seizures and encephalopathy. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; DIAZEPAM (ADULT: 5 to 10 mg, repeat every 10 to 15 min as needed; CHILD: 0.2 to 0.5 mg\/kg, repeat every 5 min as needed) or LORAZEPAM (ADULT: 2 to 4 mg; CHILD: 0.05 to 0.1 mg\/kg).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: No pre-hospital decontamination is needed. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not needed.<\/li><li>Airway management: Not generally required.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor liver enzymes and kidney function due to potential for hepatic and renal damage. Monitor urine output and urinalysis after large overdose. Blood or urine bismuth concentrations are not routinely available from most clinical laboratories and they are not clinically useful in the acute setting.  Blood bismuth concentrations less than 5 mcg\/dL are seldom associated with symptoms.  Normal background levels are approximately 1 to 5 mcg\/dL.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no evidence that diuresis or hemodialysis is effective. Case reports suggest that chelation with unithiol combined with hemodialysis may increase bismuth elimination. In animal studies, succimer, D-penicillamine, and unithiol (DMPS) accelerated bismuth elimination. However, the efficacy of chelator treatment in humans has not been clearly demonstrated, and it is not routinely recommended.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Small, single ingestions of bismuth are unlikely to cause systemic toxicity. Asymptomatic patients may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with large, acute overdoses and those with self-harm attempts should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. Patients with symptoms of chronic intoxication should be referred to a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Those with persistent vomiting or evidence of systemic toxicity should be admitted for observation and supportive care. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or your local poison control center for any patient who develops systemic toxicity from bismuth.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>METRONIDAZOLE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients may only need observation. SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Orotracheal intubation for airway protection should be performed early in cases of CNS depression or repeated seizure activity. DISULFIRAM-LIKE REACTION: Manage hypotension with IV fluids. If hypotension persists, use direct-acting vasopressors such as epinephrine or norepinephrine. Benzodiazepines may be used for associated agitation or anxiety. Fomepizole inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing the formation of acetaldehyde, and could theoretically be useful in treating severe disulfiram-like reactions, although there is limited experience with this therapy.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Most patients remain asymptomatic; prehospital decontamination is not routinely recommended. HOSPITAL: Consider decontamination if a patient presents promptly after a large oral overdose, is not vomiting, and does not have CNS depression or seizures.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with CNS depression or seizures.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Nausea: Antiemetics may be used to control nausea.<\/li><li>Tachycardia: If the patient cannot tolerate fluids, IV fluids can be given. If anxiety from a disulfiram-like reaction is present, a benzodiazepine can be given.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: If patient is hypotensive, it is either from a disulfiram-like reaction or a co-ingestant. Secure intravenous access and put patient in supine position. Initiate treatment with IV fluids. Initiate pressors if necessary and titrate to a mean arterial pressure of at least 60 mmHg. If a pressor is needed to increase blood pressure, a direct-acting agent such as norepinephrine or epinephrine is best. Insert foley bladder catheter and monitor urine output.<\/li><li>Headache: Oral analgesics can be given if tolerated. If the patient is nauseated, IV analgesics can be given.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are rare and often self-limited but may be a result of CNS stimulation. Treatment includes IV benzodiazepines. If seizures persist, use propofol or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Metronidazole plasma concentrations are not clinically useful or readily available. A CBC should be obtained if leukopenia is suspected clinically. Monitor serum electrolytes and glucose, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. No specific lab work is needed in most patients but may be helpful in ruling out other causes of altered mental status or seizures if they occur. Consider head CT and lumbar puncture to rule out intracranial mass, bleeding or infection for patients with CNS manifestations. Acute toxicity has not been reported with this drug.  However, standard treatment measures may be indicated in ingestions of greater than 1 to 2 grams.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are UNLIKELY to be of value for metronidazole.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with unintentional ingestions can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation for at least 4 hours. Any patient with symptoms should be sent to a healthcare facility and observed until symptoms improve or resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with significant seizure activity, marked disulfiram-like reaction and\/or persistent abnormal vital signs should be admitted. Patients with seizures, severe hypotension or any other life-threatening result of toxicity should be admitted to an intensive care setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>TETRACYCLINES <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tetracyclines generally have a low order of toxicity. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea, treat dehydration with IV fluids as necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor renal function following a large overdose. ANAPHYLAXIS: Mild to moderate allergic reactions may be treated with antihistamines with or without inhaled beta adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. Diphenhydramine: ADULT: 50 mg orally, IV, or IM initially, then 25 to 50 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 24 to 72 hours. CHILD: 1.25 mg\/kg orally, IV, or IM initially, then 5 mg\/kg\/day orally in 4 divided doses for 24 to 72 hours. Treatment of severe anaphylaxis also includes oxygen supplementation, aggressive airway management, epinephrine, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is unlikely, gastrointestinal decontamination is generally NOT required.  DILUTION: Tetracycline and doxycycline have been implicated in causing esophageal ulcerations when taken therapeutically with minimal amounts of fluids. Immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mL) of water or milk (not to exceed 4 ounces or 120 mL in a child). HOSPITAL: Tetracyclines are generally of a low order of toxicity. In most cases, gastrointestinal decontamination will not be required. Antacids may be useful in managing gastric irritation.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway support is unlikely to be necessary following mild to moderate exposure; airway management may be necessary in patients that develop severe anaphylaxis.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific lab work (CBC, electrolyte, urinalysis) is needed unless otherwise clinically indicated following a minor exposure. Monitor renal function after very large ingestions or in patients with baseline impaired renal function. Plasma tetracycline concentrations are not clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of value with these agents because of their high degree of protein binding. Tetracycline is not dialyzable.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: An asymptomatic child taking an inadvertent 1 to 2 tablets can likely be monitored at home, or an asymptomatic adult taking an inadvertent extra dose can be safely managed at home. Tetracycline and doxycycline have been implicated in causing esophageal ulcerations when taken therapeutically with minimal amounts of fluids. Immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 milliliters) of water or milk (not to exceed 4 ounces or 120 milliliters in a child). OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Obtain a baseline CBC and renal function following a significant exposure. Patients may be discharged to home once symptoms have resolved and laboratory studies are within normal limits. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients experiencing severe or persistent anaphylactic symptoms should be admitted for further monitoring and treatment as indicated.

ADULT: In 6 patients who ingested 227 g\/day for 3 weeks, there were no detectable blood levels 24 hours after cessation of therapy and no symptoms. An adult developed acute renal failure, Fanconi's syndrome, and oral ulcerations after ingesting 5.4 g colloidal bismuth subcitrate. PEDIATRIC: Acute toxic symptoms have occurred with as little as 5.2 mg IM over 26 hours in a 21-month-old to 30 g over 8 days in a 7.5-year-old. A 17-year-old developed acute renal failure but recovered after ingesting 7.5 g bismuth subcitrate.
