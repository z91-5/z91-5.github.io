To a lesser extent, sucralfate forms a viscous, adhesive barrier on the surface of intact mucosa of the stomach and duodenum . Sucralfate also inhibits pepsin activity and has been found to bind bile salts in vitro. Recent information suggests that sucralfate may increase the production of prostaglandin E 2 and gastric mucus .<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"573670-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"573670-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Food effect: interferes, administer on an empty stomach <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"573670-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Oral-Local: Fecal: Primarily; Renal: small amounts<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"573670-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>give on empty stomach<\/li><li>antacids should not be taken within one-half hour before or after administration<\/li><li>do not take cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine within 2 h before administration<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"573670-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>signs and symptoms or endoscopic improvement is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>blood glucose levels in diabetic patients<\/li><li>renal function in elderly patients<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"573670-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Suspension: 1 GM\/10 ML<\/li><li>Oral Tablet: 1 GM<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Carafate<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Suspension: 1 GM\/10 ML<\/li><li>Oral Tablet: 1 GM<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"573670-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>This drug may cause constipation, bezoar formation, and aluminum toxicity.<\/li><li>Advise patient to take drug on empty stomach.<\/li><li>Patient should not take antacids 30 min before or after taking this drug.<\/li><li>Tell patient to avoid taking cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine 2 h before or after taking sucralfate.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
