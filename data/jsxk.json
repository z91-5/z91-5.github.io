Cabergoline inhibits the synthesis and release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary by directly stimulating the D 2 receptors of the pituitary lactotrophs in a dose-related fashion . While  cabergoline doses up to 2 mg inhibited prolactin in healthy volunteers, similar inhibition did not occur for the other anterior pituitary hormones, including growth hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, corticotropin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone.

It has also been used to treat motor complications associated with chronic levodopa therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and for its long-lasting lowering of serum growth hormone and prolactin levels in acromegalic patients. PHARMACOLOGY: Cabergoline is a long-acting dopaminergic agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. In receptor-binding studies, cabergoline has been shown to have low affinity for dopamine D1, alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic, and 5-HT1- and 5-HT2-serotonin receptors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose information is limited.  Cabergoline overdose may result in hypotension, nasal congestion, syncope, or hallucinations. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Headache, dizziness, postural hypotension, dyskinesias, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation may frequently occur with therapeutic administration. INFREQUENT: Other effects that may occur less frequently include hallucinations, nasal congestion, and elevations of serum transaminases and bilirubin. RARE: Slight decreases in hemoglobin levels, mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have rarely been reported. CHRONIC: Congestive heart failure and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported with long-term therapy with cabergoline.<br\/>"},{"id":"jsxks12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CABERGOLINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Orthostatic hypotension is frequently reported with cabergoline therapy and may occur following initial doses greater than 1 mg. Patients with mild orthostatic hypotension can be treated by remaining prone. Those who remain hypotensive can be treated with IV fluids.  Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine, if unresponsive to fluids.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain their airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary unless other toxic agents have been administered concurrently.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor blood pressure in symptomatic patients. Monitor for signs of dyskinesias. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting. Obtain a chest x-ray in symptomatic patients. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe symptoms despite treatment should be admitted.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a regional poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jsxks12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CABERGOLINE <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific minimum toxic dose of cabergoline has not been established.
