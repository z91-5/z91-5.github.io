OVERDOSE: Angina, polycythemia, worsening of hypertension, and exacerbation of chronic lung disease have been reported after chronic overdose. Overdose data are limited. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Hypertension, headache, myalgia, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and chest pain, and seizures have been associated with therapeutic use of these agents. Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms have also been reported. Increases in serious and potentially life-threatening cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, and stroke) have been reported with target hemoglobin levels of 13.5 g\/dL or greater. OTHER: Thrombosis at vascular access sites and clotting in the dialyzer, thrombophlebitis (deep and\/or superficial) has been reported with darbepoetin alfa and deep venous thrombosis has occurred with epoetin alfa, iron deficiency, flu-like symptoms including chills and arthralgia, hyperkalemia, skin rashes, and increased mortality with higher hematocrit (greater than 36) have occurred.
