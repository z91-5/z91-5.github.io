PHARMACOLOGY: HIV integrase inhibitors bind to the integrase active site and block the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is an essential part of the HIV replication cycle. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: At the time of this review, there are no acute overdose data available. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common adverse effects following therapeutic administration, with an incidence of 2% or greater, and that are moderate to severe in intensity, are insomnia and headache. Other adverse effects include: DOLUTEGRAVIR: Elevated hepatic enzymes (6% to 8%), elevated serum cholesterol levels (8%), hyperglycemia (12%), elevated serum lipase levels (8%). ELVITEGRAVIR: Diarrhea (7%), nausea (4%). RALTEGRAVIR: Hyperglycemia (10%), nausea (7%), vomiting (7%), diarrhea (16%), elevated serum lipase levels (5%), dizziness (11%), fatigue (9%).

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted.
