PHARMACOLOGY: Exemestane is an irreversible steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. In the aromatase enzyme, exemestane causes inactivation by suicide inhibition when it is processed as an intermediate and binds to the active site of the enzyme. This effect significantly lowers circulating estrogen levels. Exemestane has no other effect on enzymes other than aromatase. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Toxicity is expected to be an extension of adverse effects. A child (age unknown) developed leukocytosis 1 hour after accidentally ingesting a 25 mg tablet of exemestane. His blood tests obtained 4 days after the incident were normal. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: dizziness, headache, fatigue, insomnia, hot flashes, nausea, and vomiting.  LESS COMMON: Depression, insomnia, anxiety, elevations in alkaline phosphatase, and dyspnea. <br\/>"},{"id":"925068-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>EXEMESTANE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. For mild\/moderate asymptomatic hypertension (no end organ damage), pharmacologic treatment is generally not necessary. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy. Nitroprusside is the preferred agent for severe hypertension. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal for recent, substantial ingestion in a patient who is alert and can protect the airway. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered for patients who present early after overdose and are alert and able to maintain their airway.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs in all patients. Monitor CBC and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients. Monitor fluid and electrolyte status in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in the management of overdose since exemestane is highly protein bound and has a large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children and adults with an inadvertent minor ingestion (or 1 or 2 doses) of a exemestane can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with a deliberate self-harm ingestion should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Patients who remain asymptomatic may be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted.
