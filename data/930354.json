Amoxapine is used to treat different types of depression (eg, neurotic or reactive depressive disorders, endogenous and psychotic depression). Loxapine is used to treat patients with schizophrenia. Dibenzoxazepine is also the main component of CR gas, a lacrimating agent used for crowd control.  Refer to \"LACRIMATORS\" document for information on CR gas. PHARMACOLOGY: Amoxapine is an antidepressant with mild sedative property and an unknown mechanism of action. It reduces norepinephrine and serotonin uptake and inhibits the response of dopamine receptors to dopamine. It is not an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Although the exact mechanism of action of loxapine has not been completely established, loxapine is thought to improve psychotic conditions by blocking dopamine at postsynaptic receptor sites in the brain. TOXICOLOGY: In overdose, anticholinergic and antihistamine effects cause CNS depression. Increased norepinephrine in the brain can lead to seizure activity. Dopaminergic blockade leads to extrapyramidal symptoms including tardive dyskinesia, delirium, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Amoxapine and loxapine use and therefore overdose has decreased in the last 20 years use with the advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics. However, severe toxicity and deaths have been reported. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: These agents can cause tachycardia, mild anticholinergic effects, and mild CNS depression. SEVERE TOXICITY: CNS depression and recurrent, prolonged seizures predominate. Complications of status epilepticus such as profound metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis with subsequent acute renal failure may develop if seizures are not rapidly controlled. Hypotension also develops with severe overdose. Dysrhythmias are not a predominant feature, but may develop in patients with severe acidosis or protracted seizures. Supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, premature ventricular contractions, nonspecific ST segment and T wave changes, QRS prolongation, bradycardia, and myocardial failure have been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has also been reported in a patient following amoxapine overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: AMOXAPINE: COMMON (up to 14%): Drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision. INFREQUENT: Nausea, anxiety, insomnia, restlessness, nervousness, palpitations, tremors, confusion, excitement, ataxia, dizziness, headache, fatigue, weakness, increased perspiration, edema, skin rash, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. LOXAPINE: COMMON: Extrapyramidal effects, akathisia, dystonia (eg, spasm of the neck muscles, tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, dyspnea, and\/or protrusion of the tongue), parkinsonian-like symptoms (eg, tremor, rigidity, excessive salivation, and masked facies), tardive dyskinesia. INFREQUENT: Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, faintness, weakness, insomnia, agitation, tension, seizures, akinesia, slurred speech, numbness, confusion, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, lightheadedness, dermatitis, rash, neuroleptic malignant syndrome. <br\/>"},{"id":"930354-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ANTIDEPRESSANTS, DIBENZOXAZEPINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Care is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Seizure should be treated aggressively with benzodiazepines. Seizures refractory to benzodiazepines should be treated with phenobarbital or propofol. If the above measures fail, treat with neuromuscular paralysis with continuous EEG monitoring. QRS widening should be treated with sodium bicarbonate and intubation\/hyperventilation to achieve blood pH of 7.45 to 7.55. Early intubation is advised in any patient with CNS depression, seizures, QRS prolongation or ventricular dysrhythmia. Treat hyperthermia with control of seizures and external cooling measures. Treat hypotension with intravenous fluids, control of seizures and correction of severe acidosis. if hypotension persists, use vasopressors; norepinephrine is generally preferred to dopamine.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for abrupt onset of seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal and orogastric lavage may be of benefit even several hours after ingestion, due to the anticholinergic effects of these drugs in overdose. However, because of the potential for seizure and CNS depression, endotracheal intubation for airway protection should be strongly considered prior to decontamination.<\/li><li>Airway management: Early intubation is advised in any patient with CNS depression, seizures, QRS prolongation or ventricular dysrhythmia.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Acidosis: Treat severe metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.1) with sodium bicarbonate 1 to 2 mEq\/kg.<\/li><li>Drug interaction: PHYSOSTIGMINE: Physostigmine use in the setting of tricyclic antidepressant overdose has been associated with the development of seizures and fatal dysrhythmias.  It is NOT recommended. FLUMAZENIL: Use of flumazenil is not recommended as it may precipitate seizures.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, arterial blood gases, and CPK in patients with seizure or severe CNS depression. Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Serum drug concentrations are generally not useful in acute management. In general, cyclic antidepressant concentrations greater than 1000 ng\/mL are associated with coma, seizures, and dysrhythmias. However, significant and life-threatening toxicity may occur at serum concentrations less than 1000 ng\/mL.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not effective in the removal of antidepressants from the body due to the high protein binding and large volume of drug distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Inadvertent pediatric ingestions should be evaluated in a healthcare facility given the risk of seizures. Asymptomatic inadvertent ingestion of up to a double therapeutic dose in adults may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any pediatric ingestion, any adult ingesting more than a double a therapeutic dose, and any patient with a deliberate ingestion should be referred to a healthcare facility. Patients should received activated charcoal and be monitored for 6 hours. If asymptomatic after 6 hours, with normal vital signs and ECG, patients may be discharged or cleared for psychiatric evaluation as appropriate. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with CNS depression should be admitted and monitored for potential seizure activity. Patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for any patient with severe toxicity. Consult a neurologist for patients with status epilepticus and those requiring continuous EEG monitoring.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930354-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ANTIDEPRESSANTS, DIBENZOXAZEPINE<\/b><br\/>TOXICOLOGY: Fatal poisonings have occurred in children following the ingestion of as little as 250 mg of amoxapine.
