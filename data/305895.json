INGESTION - Emesis is contraindicated due to rapid onset CNS depression.  Absorption is  rapid, gastric decontamination is unlikely to be useful unless performed very soon after ingestion. DERMAL - Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area extremely thoroughly with soap and water.<\/li><li>Seizure: IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates.<\/li><li>Malignant hyperthermia: Stop exposure immediately. Reduce body temperature with external cooling measures. Administration of dantrolene may be considered. DANTROLENE - Initial dose of 1 mg\/kg rapid IV, may be repeated as needed to a cumulative dose of 10 mg\/kg.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Lidocaine and amiodarone for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders (particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia).<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen and endotracheally intubate as clinically indicated.<\/li><li>Acidosis: Treat acidosis (pH less than 7.1) with IV sodium bicarbonate.<\/li><li>Fluid\/electrolyte balance regulation:  Fluid and electrolyte replacement may be necessary in cases of metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and myoglobinemia.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NS, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Rhabdomyolysis: Early aggressive fluid replacement to prevent renal insufficiency. Diuretics may be needed to maintain urine output. Urinary alkalinization is NOT routinely recommended.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"305895-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ISOFLURANE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose has not been established.
