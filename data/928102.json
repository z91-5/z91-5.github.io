Their indications include reversal of life-threatening respiratory depression secondary to stimulation of opioid receptors (nalmefene), treatment of alcohol dependence (naltrexone), and reversal of opioid-induced constipation (methylnaltrexone). Naltrexone is also used to treat chronic opioid dependence once detoxification is complete. Nalmefene hydrochloride injection was discontinued from the market in 2008. PHARMACOLOGY: Long acting opioid antagonists compete and displace narcotics at opioid receptor sites. TOXICOLOGY: Secondary to its antagonists effects at opioid receptors, these drugs may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent patients. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Naltrexone is used commonly in patients with ethanol or opioid dependence to help prevent relapse. Nalmefene and methylnaltrexone are less widely used for their specific indications. Overdose with these agents is rare. OVERDOSE: Limited data available. High doses have caused tremor, hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, and agitation. High doses will precipitate opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse reactions to long acting opioid antagonists relate to their antagonistic effects to narcotics and the resulting withdrawal symptoms. They may include pain, hypertension, diaphoresis, and agitation. In neonate, withdrawal symptoms may manifest with crying and poor feeding efforts. Pulmonary edema and dysrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in association with the use of opioid antagonists to reverse narcotic effects, but it is unclear whether these complications were the result of their use. Other reported adverse effects include dose-related hepatotoxicity, eosinophilic pneumonia, injection site reactions, depression or suicidal ideation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypotension, somnolence, headache, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, anxiety, miosis, joint and muscle pain, and rhabdomyolysis. <br\/>"},{"id":"928102-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OPIOID ANTAGONISTS, LONG ACTING <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: For mild to moderate toxicity, supportive care is the mainstay of treatment. This may include benzodiazepines to treat agitation and antiemetics to treat nausea and vomiting. In addition, medical providers have used clonidine to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine to treat diarrhea. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. If hypertension develops secondary to withdrawal and agitation, benzodiazepines may be useful. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: For severe toxicity, the mainstay of treatment is supportive care. If patients develop pulmonary distress, endotracheal intubation may be required. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not indicated as toxicity is self-limited. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not indicated unless more toxic co-ingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with pulmonary distress.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring, obtain an ECG, and administer oxygen.  Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders.  Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, particularly in patients with underlying impaired cardiac function. Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the large volume of distribution of these agents.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No laboratory studies are need unless otherwise clinically indicated. Serum concentrations of these drugs are not widely available or clinically useful in guiding management. Patients who receive these agents to reverse opioid toxicity should be monitored for CNS and respiratory depression and evidence of opioid withdrawal. Monitor vital signs, mental status, CK, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Long acting opioid antagonist exposures in general should be very safe and asymptomatic patients with inadvertent exposure may remain at home. However, if it was used to reverse opioid toxicity, the patient should be brought into a healthcare facility for further evaluation or if the patients are symptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate overdose, and patients in whom these drugs were used to reverse opioid toxicity should be referred to a healthcare facility. Criteria for discharge include a patient who is asymptomatic or clearly improving after an observation period of 4 to 6 hours without treatment. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have persistent symptoms or any evidence of pulmonary edema should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: If there are any concerns, a toxicologist or a poison center can be consulted for advice regarding the use of long acting opioid antagonists. <\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928102-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>OPIOID ANTAGONISTS, LONG ACTING<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: There are no specific known toxic doses associated with long acting opioid antagonists.
