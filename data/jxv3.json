PHARMACOLOGY: Lomitapide mesylate is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent that binds to and inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which prevents the assembly of apo B-containing lipoproteins in hepatocytes and enterocytes. Therefore, the synthesis of chylomicrons and VLDL is inhibited, which leads to reduced levels of LDL-C. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Signs and symptoms of an acute overdose are anticipated to be similar to excessive pharmacologic adverse events. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (34% or greater): Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. COMMON (17% to 24%): Weight loss, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, constipation, flatulence, increased liver enzymes, chest pain, influenza, nasopharyngitis, and fatigue. OTHER EFFECTS: Palpitations, angina pectoris, gastroesophageal reflux disease, defecation urgency, rectal tenesmus, gastroenteritis, back pain, headache, dizziness, pharyngolaryngeal pain, nasal congestion, and fever. DRUG INTERACTION: Concomitant administration of lomitapide with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase lomitapide exposure 27 fold. <br\/>"},{"id":"jxv3s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>LOMITAPIDE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
