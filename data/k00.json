PHARMACOLOGY: Tricyclic antidepressants are structurally similar to the phenothiazines, and have actions at numerous receptor sites in the body, including anticholinergic, alpha-blocking activities, serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition, anticholinergic activity, sodium and potassium channel blockade, and CNS and respiratory depression. They are highly bound to plasma proteins, as well as bound to intracellular sites. Dulling of depressive ideation may explain their antidepressant efficacy. TOXICOLOGY: Toxicities are mostly via exaggeration of pharmacologic activities, including CNS depression, seizurogenicity, sodium channel blockade, and alpha-adrenergic blockade. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures to tricyclic antidepressants are very common and are a major cause of drug-related fatalities in the AAPCC database. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hallucinoses, and other anticholinergic effects may be seen at lower doses. SEVERE TOXICITY: Coma, seizures, QRS prolongation with ventricular dysrhythmias, respiratory failure, and  hypotension are the primary life threats. Slowed GI motility may result in retained GI tract drug, with recurrence of toxicity once initial effects resolve and the GI tract becomes active again. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Therapeutic doses initially may cause drowsiness and difficulty concentrating. Hallucinations, excitement, and confusion may be seen at therapeutic doses. Anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention) may occur.<br\/>"},{"id":"k00s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ANTIDEPRESSANTS, TRICYCLIC <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: In isolated exposures, toxicity occurs along a spectrum, and mild to moderate toxicity on presentation may progress to severe toxicity over minutes to hours. For patients with mild to moderate effects on presentation, activated charcoal should be considered in patients presenting less than 2 hours postingestion. Aggressive symptomatic and supportive care includes behavioral and temperature control, airway protection, blood pressure support, QRS monitoring and narrowing, and seizure control. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Activated charcoal should be considered in patients presenting less than 2 hours postingestion (protect airway first). Aggressive symptomatic and supportive care is essential, including behavioral and temperature control, airway protection, blood pressure support, QRS monitoring and narrowing, and seizure control. Consider intravenous lipid therapy early for patients with ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital induction of emesis is contraindicated. Prehospital administration of activated charcoal may be considered only if endotracheal intubation can be performed in order to protect the airway should CNS depression and\/or seizures occur. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal should be given if within 2 hours of exposure. The patient's ability to protect the airway or the need for intubation should be considered.  The role of gastric lavage is unclear, but should be considered for massive ingestions presenting within the first 60 minutes, in patients who can protect their airway or who have been intubated.<\/li><li>Airway management: Severe toxicity almost always requires intubation and ventilator support.<\/li><li>Antidote: There are no specific antidotes.<\/li><li>Seizure: Seizures are initially managed with benzodiazepines. Phenobarbital can be used for repetitive seizures, followed by propofol, and\/or rapid sequence intubation and general anesthesia with continuous EEG monitoring.<\/li><li>Wide QRS complex: QRS widening is managed by serum alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate and\/or hyperventilation. Both approaches may be used, but sodium bicarbonate appears superior to hyperventilation alone and the increase in extracellular sodium may be related to its efficacy. Bolus administration of sodium bicarbonate allows for larger doses than continuous IV infusion and appears more effective in increasing the serum pH. The goal is a serum pH of 7.45 to 7.55 and pH should be closely monitored so as not to exceed 7.6. Severe QRS widening (&gt;160 msec) not responsive to alkalinization may respond to a bolus of hypertonic saline. Consider infusion of lipid emulsion in patients with refractory dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Ventricular dysrhythmias should be managed initially by serum alkalinization and, if unresponsive, with antiarrhythmics. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation may be treated with lidocaine (often ineffective), amiodarone (additive QTc prolongation), and\/or D\/C shock. Phenytoin may be used for dysrhythmias unresponsive to other measures. Magnesium, overdrive pacing and D\/C shock may be used for Torsades de Pointe. Consider infusion of lipid emulsion in patients with refractory dysrhythmias or hypotension.<\/li><li>Fat emulsion: Patients who develop significant cardiovascular toxicity should be treated with intravenous lipids. Administer 1.5 mL\/kg of 20% lipid emulsion over 2 to 3 minutes as an IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min. If possible, discontinue after 30 to 60 minutes. Longer periods of lipid therapy should be considered if the patient's hemodynamic stability is dependent on continued lipid infusion.<\/li><li>Tachycardia: Tachycardia does not usually require treatment and the use of bradycardic agents, particularly beta-blockers, may result in hemodynamic collapse.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Hypotension should be managed with positioning, fluid expansion, and pressors if needed. Dopamine may be ineffective because of reuptake inhibition. Direct pressors (e.g. norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine) may more effective. Consider infusion of lipid emulsion in patients with refractory dysrhythmias or hypotension. Cardiovascular support (ECMO or cardiopulmonary bypass) may be required for patients unable to sustain oxygenation and\/or perfusion.<\/li><li>Central nervous system depression: CNS depression is managed with intubation and ventilator support.<\/li><li>Delirium: Benzodiazepines are first line for behavioral control and for termination of seizures.<\/li><li>Body temperature above reference range: Control agitation and seizures with benzodiazepines. Aggressive sedation, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are likely to be required in severe cases.  Disrobe patient, apply moist sheets or keep skin damp and use fans to enhance evaporative cooling.  Consider immersion in cold water in severe cases, but this may make resuscitation difficult.<\/li><li>Contraindicated treatment: Contraindicated treatments include flumazenil and physostigmine.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor cardiac rhythm and serial ECGs, serum electrolytes, renal function, hepatic enzymes, and CPK. Acid-base status should be followed with serial blood gases in severe toxicity when serum alkalinization is being performed or with sustained intubation. Urinalysis should be followed in those at risk for rhabdomyolysis. False positive urine TCA toxicology screens commonly occur with diphenhydramine, carbamazepine, cyclobenzaprine, quetiapine, and others. Serum tricyclic levels may be of use in drug-naive individuals and to help establish overdose in patients known to be taking tricyclics, but there is poor correlation between blood levels and clinical effects.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: There is no role for hemodialysis or other enhanced elimination techniques. Evidence of ongoing drug absorption or prolonged effects should prompt consideration of repeat doses of activated charcoal or whole bowel irrigation.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent single substance ingestions can be managed at home with follow-up via telephone if the dose is less than the maximum single therapeutic dose adjusted age or the following mg\/kg amounts (whichever is less): Desipramine: 2.5 mg\/kg or less; Nortriptyline: 2.5 mg\/kg or less; Protriptyline: 1 mg\/kg or less; Trimipramine: 2.5 mg\/kg or less; all other tricyclic antidepressants: 5 mg\/kg or less.. Patients who have not developed signs or symptoms more than 6 hours after ingestion are unlikely to develop toxicity. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with intentional ingestions, or unintentional ingestions of unknown amounts, and all symptomatic patients (eg, weak, drowsy, dizzy, tremors, palpitations) should be referred to a healthcare facility; Patients with unintentional, single substance ingestions of more than the maximum single therapeutic dose (adjusted for age) or the following mg\/kg ingestion (whichever is less) should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation: Desipramine: greater than 2.5 mg\/kg; Nortriptyline: greater than 2.5 mg\/kg; Protriptyline: greater than 1 mg\/kg; Trimipramine: greater than 2.5 mg\/kg; all other tricyclic antidepressants: greater than 5 mg\/kg. Patients who develop nothing greater than mild CNS depression and\/or sinus tachycardia and in whom all effects have resolved by 6 hours, may be discharged home. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic at 6 hours should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Serial monitoring of mental\/respiratory status, acid-base status, and ECG should be performed. Patients who have resolved all clinical effects, have a normal QRS and QTc and are eating with normal bowel activity and no recurrent effects, may be discharged. CONSULT CRITERIA: All toxic exposures should be reported to the designated regional poison center. Severe tricyclic toxicity patients should have a consultation by a medical toxicologist.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"k00s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ANTIDEPRESSANTS, TRICYCLIC<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Ingestion of 10 to 20 mg\/kg of most antidepressants constitutes a moderate to serious exposure where coma and cardiovascular symptoms are expected.
