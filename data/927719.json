Aprepitant is also used to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. PHARMACOLOGY: Aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 (NK-1)-receptor antagonist (substance P antagonist). Substance P is a tachykinin (neurokinin)  located in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system; it is associated with a variety of functions, including emesis, depression,  pain after inflammation, and inflammatory\/immune responses in asthma and  other diseases. Fosaprepitant is a prodrug of aprepitant and is rapidly converted to aprepitant following intravenous administration. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Drowsiness and headache have been reported following an overdose ingestion of aprepitant. In general, overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic administration. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse effects following therapeutic administration, at an incidence greater than 5% and at a greater incidence than standard therapy, are alopecia, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, constipation, hiccups, dizziness, dehydration, asthenia\/fatigue, and infusion site reactions (eg, swelling, extravasation, phlebitis). INFREQUENT: Adverse effects that have occurred less frequently include: bradycardia, neutropenia, elevated liver enzymes, abdominal pain, gastritis and epigastric discomfort, and stomatitis. RARE: Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been rarely reported. Isolated instances of acute hypersensitivity reactions (ie, flushing, erythema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis) have occurred during IV infusion of fosaprepitant.<br\/>"},{"id":"927719-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>APREPITANT AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Atropine may be used when severe bradycardia is associated with hypotension.  In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Bradycardia: Usually does not require treatment. Treat bradycardia with atropine; if unresponsive, use beta adrenergic agonists (eg, isoproterenol). Consider temporary pacemaker insertion.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor fluid and electrolyte status in patients with significant diarrhea. Monitor vital signs and hepatic enzymes in symptomatic patients. Rises in serum transaminases have been reported with therapeutic use. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not expected to be of benefit because of the high degree of protein binding.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe symptoms despite treatment should be admitted.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a regional poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"927719-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>APREPITANT AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: APREPITANT: In healthy volunteers, single doses up to 600 mg were generally well tolerated.
