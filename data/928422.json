Pregabalin reduces the calcium-dependent release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters, possibly by modulation of calcium channel function. Pregabalin may also interact with descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways in the brainstem that modulate pain transmission in the spinal cord.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"928422-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"928422-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Oral: time to peak concentration, 1.5 hours<\/li><li>Bioavailability: greater than or equal to 90%<\/li><li>Effect of food: no clinically relevant effect on total absorption, increase in time to peak concentration to 3 hours<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928422-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Vd: 0.5 L\/kg<\/li><li>Protein binding: none<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928422-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Hepatic; negligible <br\/>"},{"id":"928422-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Renal: 90% unchanged in the urine<\/li><li>Fecal: less than 0.1%<\/li><li>Dialyzable: yes (hemodialysis), 50% removed after 4 hour dialysis treatment<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928422-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"6.3 hours <br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"928422-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/>may take with or without food <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"928422-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>decreased pain intensity indicates efficacy in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, and neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury<\/li><li>reduction in seizure frequency indicates efficacy in patients with partial-onset seizures<\/li><li>emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal behavior or ideation, or unusual changes in behavior<\/li><li>patients routinely monitored for ocular conditions: consider more frequent ophthalmological assessment.<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"928422-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Lyrica<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Oral Capsule: 25 MG, 50 MG, 75 MG, 100 MG, 150 MG, 200 MG, 225 MG, 300 MG<\/li><li>Oral Solution: 20 MG\/ML<\/li><\/ul>"},"12":{"id":"928422-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"928422-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b> PREGABALIN <\/b><br\/>USES: Pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy or spinal cord injury, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, and as adjunctive therapy for adults with partial onset seizures. PHARMACOLOGY:  The mechanism of action in humans is unknown; however, pregabalin possibly modulates calcium channel function by reducing the calcium-dependent release of several neurotransmitters in vitro and binds with high affinity to the alpha(2)-delta site in central nervous system tissues, which may lead to antiseizure and antinociceptive effects. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose effects are expected to be extensions of adverse effects at therapeutic doses. In patients receiving greater than or equal to 900 mg, the clinical events reported were similar to those at the recommended doses. An adult ingested an estimated 1.5 g; mild drowsiness was the only symptom observed. SEVERE TOXICITY: An adult intentionally ingested 8.4 g of pregabalin and developed CNS depression and coma approximately 3 hours after exposure. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation for 26 hours. No permanent sequelae occurred. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dizziness and somnolence, ataxia, tremor, amnesia, speech disturbances, myoclonus, neuropathy, confusion, euphoria, incoordination, abnormal gait, nervousness, twitching, headache. LESS COMMON: Peripheral edema, a mildly prolonged PR interval, decreased platelet count, and increased creatine kinase, rhabdomyolysis and blurred vision.<br\/>"},{"id":"928422-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>PREGABALIN <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment of pregabalin exposure is largely supportive in nature with careful attention to airway protection in severe cases.  Hypotension is usually mild responding to intravenous fluid boluses. If hypotension persists, administer dopamine or norepinephrine. Admit all severely symptomatic patients. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines or barbiturates.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital GI decontamination is generally not necessary. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if ingestion was recent, substantial and patient can protect airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubation and mechanical ventilation will be necessary of significant CNS or respiratory depression develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Seizure: Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor ECG for PR prolongation and CBC for decreased platelets. Monitor fluids and electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting. In patients with muscle pain, weakness or tenderness, monitor CK for rhabdomyolysis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis has been used in a hemodialysis dependent patient following inadvertent pregabalin exposure. The manufacturer has suggested that hemodialysis might be useful in patients with severe toxicity or those with significant renal impairment. Standard hemodialysis results in pregabalin clearance of approximately 50% in 4 hours. Dialysis is rarely necessary as most patients do well with supportive care.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with inadvertent ingestions who are not symptomatic may be observed at home with telephone follow up. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Observe all patients who are symptomatic for 4 to 6 hours. When patients are asymptomatic they may be discharged home. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admit all moderately to severely symptomatic patients, especially if there is a concern for falls, inability to care for self, or risk of worsening central nervous system depression. CONSULT CRITERIA: Involve a toxicologist or poison center with any patient with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928422-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b> PREGABALIN <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: During clinical development, the highest reported accidental overdose was 8000 mg with no clinically significant effects observed.
