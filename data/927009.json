Adefovir is phosphorylated to the active metabolite, adefovir diphosphate, by cellular kinases. Adefovir diphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine triphosphate and by causing DNA chain termination after its incorporation into viral DNA. The inhibition constant (Ki) for adefovir diphosphate for HBV DNA polymerase is 0.1 micromolar. Adefovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of human DNA polymerases alpha and gamma with Ki values of 1.18 micromolar and 0.97 micromolar, respectively.<\/li><li>The in vitro antiviral activity of adefovir was determined in HBV transfected human hepatoma cell lines.
