precise mechanism by which inhalation anesthetics produce loss of perception of sensations and unconsciousness is not known. Inhaled anesthetics act at many areas in the CNS. The Meyer-Overton theory suggests that the site of action of inhalation anesthetics may be the lipid matrix of neuronal membranes or other lipophilic sites. Anesthetics may cause changes in membrane thickness, which  in turn affect the gating properties of ion channels in neurons. Interference with the hydrophobic portion of neuronal ion channel membrane proteins may be an important mechanism .<\/li><li>Concentration-response relationships for inhalation anesthetics are described in terms of the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), which is defined as the alveolar concentration that prevents movement in 50% of patients after surgical skin incision. The MAC decreases with pregnancy, hypothermia, hypotension, increasing age, and concurrent use of other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including other inhalation anesthetics. Average MAC values for sevoflurane (vaporized in oxygen) are 3.3%, 3%, 2.6%, 1.7%, and 1.4% for  neonates, and patients 1 to 6 months, 25 years, 60 years, and 80 years of age, respectively . While MAC is commonly used to compare the concentration-response relationships for inhalation anesthetics, the AD 95 (the dose preventing 95% of patients from moving in response to skin incision) is more clinically relevant in dosing patients with inhalation anesthetics, if the inhalation anesthetic is used alone . Often, inhalation anesthetics are used in combination with other agents to supplement anesthesia.<\/li><li>Cardiovascular system effects: has several effects that serve to lower blood pressure. It depresses cardiac function, decreases cardiac contractility, and decreases peripheral vascular resistance   in a manner similar to that of isoflurane . These effects are dose-related; increasing the concentration of sevoflurane during maintenance of anesthesia results in a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure . The effect of sevoflurane on the coronary arteries and the potential for \"coronary steal\" has been investigated in dogs. Sevoflurane administration to chronically instrumented dogs resulted in a reduced ratio of occluded\/normal and stenotic\/normal coronary artery flows. However, the ratios returned to normal when the arterial blood pressure and heart rate were restored to conscious values .<\/li><li>Sevoflurane has little effect on heart rate or rhythm. At clinically useful doses, sevoflurane does not increase heart rate or myocardial oxygen consumption . At higher concentrations, sevoflurane may increase heart rate . A study on the effects of sevoflurane on the arrhythmic response to epinephrine suggests that sevoflurane does not greatly sensitize the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effect of catecholamines .<\/li><li>CNS: Electroencephalogram (EEG): Sevoflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in EEG activity. In dogs and rabbits, EEG burst suppression occurs at doses of 1 MAC or higher . Although sevoflurane is not believed to be epileptogenic, case reports describe clonic and tonic seizure-like movements and clinically silent electrical seizures during induction of anesthesia .<\/li><li>Effect on intracranial pressure: Sevoflurane did not impair cerebral autoregulation of blood flow when studied in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease . However, sevoflurane has the potential to increase intracranial pressure .<\/li><li>Neuromuscular effects: impairs neuromuscular conduction and decreases muscle contractility. Sevoflurane may produce sufficient muscle relaxation to allow some types of surgery to be performed without a neuromuscular blocker .<\/li><li>Respiratory system effects: depresses ventilation in a dose-dependent manner, with apnea occurring between 1.5 and 2 MAC. Surgical stimulation changes the threshold at which apnea occurs . Sevoflurane increases carbon dioxide tension and decreases ventilatory response to increased carbon dioxide concentrations .<\/li><li>Effects on the airway: Sevoflurane results in a low incidence of respiratory irritation as evidenced by a low incidence of breath-holding, coughing, increased salivation, and laryngospasm during induction .<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"923347-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"923347-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Inhalation-Systemic: Rapidly absorbed.<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"923347-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Inhalation-Systemic: Hepatic: 5% via CYP2E1pathway <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"923347-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Inhalation-Systemic: Lung; Renal:  Up to 3.5% as inorganic fluoride <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"923347-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Inhalation<\/b><br\/>calibrated vaporizer required <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"923347-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>induction of anesthesia<\/li><li>blood pressure<\/li><li>temperature<\/li><li>seizure activity<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"923347-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Inhalation Liquid: 100 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Sojourn<\/b><br\/>Inhalation Liquid: 100 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Ultane<\/b><br\/>Inhalation Liquid: 100 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Ultane Novation<\/b><br\/>Inhalation Liquid: 100 %<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"}}}
