ADVERSE EFFECTS: Enflurane may cause CNS and respiratory depression, coughing, laryngospasm, hypotension, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, and seizures.  ECG changes, nausea and vomiting, and malignant hyperthermia have occurred with enflurane anesthesia.

Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty in breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. ORAL - Emesis is NOT recommended due to rapid absorption and rapid onset of CNS depression. Consider activated charcoal if administered early and airway is protected. DERMAL - Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area extremely thoroughly with soap and water.<\/li><li>Seizure: IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates.<\/li><li>Malignant hyperthermia: Reduce body temperature with external cooling measures. Consider administration of dantrolene. DANTROLENE - Initial recommended dose is 1 mg\/kg by rapid IV infusion; if symptoms persist or reappear, the dose may be repeated up to a cumulative dose of 10 mg\/kg.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring, and administer oxygen. Consider lidocaine, amiodarone as first-line agents.<\/li><li>Airway management: Administer oxygen; intubate and mechanically ventilate as clinically indicated.<\/li><li>Fluid\/electrolyte balance regulation: Fluid and electrolyte replacement may be necessary in cases of metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and myoglobinemia.<\/li><li>Metabolic acidosis: Monitor arterial blood gases. Treat severe acidosis (pH less than 7.1) with IV sodium bicarbonate.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl 10 to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Rhabdomyolysis: Early aggressive fluid replacement, diuretics to maintain urine output.
