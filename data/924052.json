Effects","mono":"<b>DOXORUBICIN <\/b><br\/>USES: DOXOrubicin is an antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of a wide range of cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, and malignant neoplasms of the bladder, breast, lung, ovary, gastric, and thyroid.  Liposomal DOXOrubicin is used to treat ovarian cancer, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and multiple myeloma. PHARMACOLOGY: DOXOrubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic thought to act on malignant cells by intercalating the cell nucleotide base and binding the cell membrane lipid. Intercalation blocks replication of nucleotide and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. It also interacts with topoisomerase II to form DNA-cleavable complexes, which is believed to be an important mechanism of its cytocidal activity. DOXOrubicin encapsulated in sterically-stabilized liposomes (Stealth(R) liposomes) has been shown to efficiently penetrate solid tumors.  This is attributed in part to their small size and prolonged circulation time; a long blood-survival time appears required for sufficient uptake. Following distribution of liposomes to the tissue compartment, free DOXOrubicin is released, although the precise mechanism for this effect is unclear. DOXOrubicin is extensively metabolized in the liver. TOXICOLOGY: DOXOrubicin interferes with DNA replication in rapidly dividing cells, such as bone marrow and gastrointestinal epithelium. Cardiac toxicity of DOXOrubicin may be related to free radical production. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, and severe myelosuppression have been reported following DOXOrubicin overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe bone marrow suppression, acute cardiomyopathy (ie, ECG changes, dysrhythmias, heart failure, hypotension), severe mucositis, vomiting, and diarrhea may develop. INTRATHECAL INJECTION: Severe neurotoxicity (ie, paraparesis, coma, acute hydrocephalus), and death have been reported after unintentional intrathecal administration of DOXOrubicin. EYE EXPOSURE: Splash exposures have caused self limited conjunctivitis and rarely corneal infiltrates and iritis. DERMAL EXPOSURE: Generally causes no toxicity, or self limited irritation that resolves rapidly.  DOXOrubicin is a vesicant; ulceration and skin necrosis can occur with extravasation. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Delayed cardiomyopathy is the dose-limiting toxicity of DOXOrubicin. ACUTE: Acute cardiac toxicity usually presents as transient dysrhythmias, especially sinus tachycardia. These effects usually appear on an ECG as nonspecific ST-T changes, decreased QRS voltage, and a prolonged QT interval.  Premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular, and bundle-branch block have also been reported in patients receiving DOXOrubicin. Acute effects usually occur within 24 to 48 hours after a single dose or course of anthracycline therapy. SUBACUTE: DOXOrubicin-induced cardiotoxicity may occur late in the course of therapy or within 2 to 3 months after treatment discontinuation. A reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and\/or signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (eg, tachycardia, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, dependent edema, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, oliguria, ascites, pleural effusion, and gallop rhythm) may also occur. DELAYED\/LATE: The chronic cardiomyopathy related to the cumulative dose of DOXOrubicin is characterized by congestive heart failure. The risk of acute left ventricular failure increases rapidly following total cumulative doses above 550 mg\/m(2). However, heart failure may also occur with lower (400 mg\/m(2)) doses, especially in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinal area or concomitant therapy with other cardiotoxic agents (eg, cyclophosphamide). OTHER EFFECTS: Bone marrow suppression is the acute dose-limiting toxicity. Nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and alopecia are common with therapeutic use. Secondary malignancies, primarily acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported. <br\/>"},{"id":"924052-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DOXORUBICIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor for signs of congestive heart failure. Treat nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Administer dexrazoxane to prevent cardiomyopathy. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Monitor for signs of congestive heart failure. Dexrazoxane should be used for the prophylaxis of cardiomyopathy. Treat patients with heart failure with diuretics, vasodilators, ACE inhibitors, and inotropic agents as indicated. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. <\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Inadvertent intrathecal injection has been reported with DOXOrubicin in a small number of cases, resulting in severe neurologic toxicity. After an overdose,  keep the patient upright and immediately drain at least 20 mL of CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free saline). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 24 hours). Add fresh frozen plasma (25 mL FFP to 1 L NS or LR) or 5% albumin to the perfusate to enhance removal as DOXOrubicin is highly protein bound. Dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Decontamination is not necessary in most situations as DOXOrubicin is administered intravenously. For dermal exposures, clean skin with soap and water, and for eye exposures, flush with water.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect airway or if unstable dysrhythmias develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote, but dexrazoxane should be administered as soon as possible if the dose administered puts the patient at risk for delayed cardiomyopathy, or if extravasation has occurred.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors following a significant overdose as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, generally these are most effective in preventing nausea and vomiting, and are less effective than dopamine agonists), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Extravasation injury: If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Administer dexrazoxane (see dosing below). Elevate the affected area. Apply ice packs for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily for 3 days. Stop cooling procedures at least 15 minutes prior to and during dexrazoxane administration to allow sufficient blood flow. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested.  If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable).  Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy. DEXRAZOXANE: DOSE: The initial dose is 1000 mg\/m(2) infused intravenously using a different venous access site over 1 to 2 hours on day 1 (MAX, 2000 mg). Treatment should occur within 6 hours of extravasation. Repeat the same dose 24 +\/- 3 hours after extravasation on day 2 (MAX, 2000 mg) followed by a 500 mg\/m(2) dose 48 +\/- 3 hours after extravasation on day 3 (MAX, 1000 mg).<\/li><li>Dexrazoxane: Dexrazoxane is used to prevent cardiomyopathy at therapeutic doses. There is no published clinical experience after overdose, but it should be administered as soon as possible if the DOXOrubicin overdose is recognized early. If the DOXOrubicin overdose is not recognized early, there is probably little benefit to administering dexrazoxane.  The usual dose of dexrazoxane to prevent cardiomyopathy is 10 times the DOXOrubicin dose (ie, 500 mg\/m(2) dexrazoxane for a 50 mg\/m(2) dose of DOXOrubicin). Additive myelosuppression generally occurs at dexrazoxane doses above 1000 mg\/m(2), so doses larger than this should generally be avoided. For extravasation, the initial dose is 1000 mg\/m(2) infused over 1 to 2 hours on day 1 (MAX, 2000 mg) and should be given within 6 hours of extravasation. Repeat the same dose 24 +\/- 3 hours after extravasation on day 2 (MAX, 2000 mg) followed by a 500 mg\/m(2) dose 48 +\/- 3 hours after extravasation on day 3 (MAX, 1000 mg).<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. It has not been studied in the setting of chemotherapy overdose. In patients with DOXOrubicin overdose, consider administering palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial CBC (with differential) and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Pancytopenia is expected after overdose. Neutrophil nadir is generally 10 to 14 days after a therapeutic dose. Monitor patient for signs of bleeding. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Monitor vital signs and serial ECGs; institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Evaluate for evidence of cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram or radionucleotide studies may be useful. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic enzymes. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of mucositis.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis is UNLIKELY to be of benefit due to high protein binding and large volume of distribution. Early use of hemoperfusion may increase the clearance of DOXOrubicin. Early plasma exchange would be expected remove significant amounts of liposomal DOXOrubicin, but there are no published overdose cases in which this has been performed.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be closely monitored in an inpatient setting, with frequent monitoring of vital signs (every 4 hours for the first 24 hours), cardiac function, and daily monitoring of CBC with differential until bone marrow suppression is resolved. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with DOXOrubicin overdose. Consult a cardiologist to manage patients with heart failure. May require surgical consult for extravasation. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924052-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>DOXORUBICIN <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ACUTE: Two patients (a 58-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl) survived DOXOrubicin overdoses of 540 mg as a single dose and 300 mg over 2 days, respectively. Complications included severe mucositis and bone marrow suppression. Fatalities have been reported after DOXOrubicin overdoses of 150 to 333 mg\/m(2) in adults. INTRATHECAL: Intrathecal injection has causes severe neurotoxicity (30 mg\/m(2) in a child and 14.5 mg in an adult). CHRONIC: The risk of acute left ventricular failure increases rapidly following total cumulative doses above 550 mg\/m(2). However, heart failure may also occur with lower (400 mg\/m(2)) doses, especially in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinal area or concomitant therapy with other cardiotoxic agents (eg, cyclophosphamide).
