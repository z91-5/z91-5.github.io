chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Ph+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who have been resistant to or intolerant of prior therapy. PHARMACOLOGY: Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that reduces the size of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) tumors by specifically inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase and Src-family kinases (Src, Lyn, and Hck). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Toxicity following overdose has not been reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse effects include abdominal pain, anemia, cough, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, nausea, pyrexia, rash, thrombocytopenia, and vomiting. LESS FREQUENT: Other adverse effects that have occurred less frequently include asthenia, decreased appetite, dizziness, edema, elevated serum lipase levels, elevated liver enzymes, hypophosphatemia, joint or back pain, neutropenia, and respiratory tract infection. RARE: Rare but serious effects that have occurred include acute renal failure, anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and QT interval prolongation.<br\/>"},{"id":"930282-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>BOSUTINIB <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Myelosuppression has been reported with therapeutic doses. Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding. QT PROLONGATION: Therapeutic doses of bosutinib may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients who are awake and able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after a potentially toxic ingestion and if the patient is able to maintain their airway or if the airway is protected.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, severe respiratory symptoms, or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors in patients who develop severe neutropenia or neutropenic sepsis. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential and platelet count daily for evidence of bone marrow suppression until recovery has occurred. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, and\/or atrial overdrive pacing.  Isoproterenol may be used if overdrive pacing is unavailable or contraindicated. Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULT: 2 g IV over 1 to 2 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILD: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Hypersensitivity reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Treat with antihistamines, may also need inhaled beta agonists, and corticosteroids. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, lipase, phosphorus levels, and liver enzymes after significant overdose. Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelets. Monitor vital signs. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain an ECG. In patients with neutropenia, monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract. Due to the risk of fetal harm, a pregnancy test is recommended in women of childbearing age who have been exposed to bosutinib. Serum bosutinib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be effective due to high protein binding (94% or higher) and large volume of distribution (6080 L).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestion of one extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than one extra dose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance, QTc prolongation, severe hypersensitivity reaction, or pulmonary edema should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930282-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>BOSUTINIB<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
