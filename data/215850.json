PHARMACOLOGY: The exact mechanism has not been fully established, but the bacteriostatic and bactericidal action of ethionamide is thought to be due to inhibition of peptide synthesis in the infecting organism. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: There are no reports of toxicity following acute overdose. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, alopecia, metallic taste, and rashes. LESS COMMON: Encephalopathy, psychosis, headache, paresthesias, somnolence, hypothyroidism, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, and insomnia.<br\/>"},{"id":"215850-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ETHIONAMIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
