PHARMACOLOGY: Synthetic vasopressin analog; has antidiuretic activity and increases plasma factor VIII activity. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive antidiuretic activity or ingestion of free water causes hyponatremia. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, headache, hyponatremia. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hyponatremia, coma and seizures have developed in children and adolescents using desmopressin nasal spray unsupervised, presumed to be inadvertent overdoses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Potentially severe adverse effects reported with therapeutic use have included: hyponatremia and water intoxication in children and infrequently in adults. Nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, headache, behavior changes, seizures and coma have been associated with hyponatremia.

HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal after recent ingestion in patients who can protect their airway.

The goal is slow correction; the serum sodium should not increase more than 2 mEq\/L\/hour in any 4 hour period or more than 15 mEq\/L per day. Rapid correction may cause central pontine myelinolysis.
