In allergic asthma, it inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor (RI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils, which limits the degree of release of mediators of the allergic response and also reduces the number of RI receptors on basophils in atopic patients. In chronic idiopathic urticaria, omalizumab binds to IgE and lowers free IgE levels, which down-regulates the IgE receptors on cells. It is unknown why this mechanism improves symptoms.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jvvfs8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"jvvfs8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Bioavailability, SubQ: 62%<\/li><li>Tmax, SubQ: 7 to 8 days<\/li><\/ul>"},"1":{"id":"jvvfs8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Vd: 78 mL\/kg <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"jvvfs8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li> Excretion: via IgG, is degraded in liver and excreted in bile<\/li><li>Total body clearance: 2.4 to 3 mL\/kg\/day; doubling the body weight resulted in a doubling of the apparent clearance<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"jvvfs8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"24 to 26 days <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"jvvfs9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Subcutaneous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute with sterile water for injection; gently swirl for approximately 1 minute and then for 5 to 10 seconds every 5 minutes thereafter, until completely dissolved<\/li><li>do not shake; may take 15 to 20 minutes or more to dissolve; do not use if not completely dissolved by 40 minutes<\/li><li>to ensure that all solution is removed, invert vial for 15 seconds allowing solution to drain to stopper; using a 1-inch, 18-gauge needle and a 3-mL syringe, withdraw contents of vial; before removing needle from vial, pull plunger back to the end of the syringe barrel to remove all solution<\/li><li>replace 18-gauge needle with a 25-gauge needle before administration<\/li><li>administration may take 5 to 10 seconds due to product viscosity<\/li><li>administer no more than 150 mg at one injection site<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jvvfs10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>baseline serum IgE levels in patients with allergic asthma; retesting levels during treatment cannot be used for dose determination; if therapy is interrupted for 1 year or longer, retest total serum IgE levels; in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, IgE levels are not useful<\/li><li>reduction in asthma exacerbations or urticaria severity may be indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>anaphylaxis; during and after administration; may occur following the first dose; time to anaphylaxis onset range, 90 minutes to 2 hours in clinical studies; has also occurred 1 year following initial treatment<\/li><li>systemic eosinophilia symptoms (ie, eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, and cardiac neuropathy); especially during oral corticosteroid dose reductions<\/li><li>stool assessment for parasitic helminths (roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, threadworm); during therapy in patients with high risk; duration of monitoring required after discontinuation of therapy is not known<\/li><li>significant body weight changes in patients with allergic asthma<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jvvfs11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Xolair<\/b><br\/>Subcutaneous Powder for Solution: 150 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"jvvfs13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Instruct patient to get emergency medical treatment right away if any signs\/symptoms of anaphylaxis develop and that symptoms can occur 24 hours or longer after drug administration.<\/li><li>Advise patient that this drug is not indicated for acute asthma attacks, acute bronchospasm, or status asthmaticus.<\/li><li>This drug may cause headaches.<\/li><li>Advise patient that full symptomatic improvement may not occur immediately.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
