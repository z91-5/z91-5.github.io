albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth. Due to diminished energy production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies. <\/li><li>Albendazole also has been shown to inhibit the enzyme fumarate reductase, which is helminth-specific. This action may be considered secondary to the effect on the microtubules due to the decreased absorption of glucose. This action occurs in the presence of reduced amounts of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide in reduced form (NADH), which is a coenzyme involved in many cellular oxidation-reduction reactions. <\/li><li>Albendazole has larvicidal effects in necatoriasis   and ovicidal effects in ascariasis, ancylostomiasis, and trichuriasis. <\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"923350-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"923350-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Poorly absorbed; food greatly increases absorption<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"923350-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic: Active metabolite: albendazole sulfoxide <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"923350-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Systemic: Fecal: small amounts<\/li><li>Albendazole sulfoxide- Renal: 1%  <\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"923350-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 8 to 15 h <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"923350-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Administer with food.<\/li><li>Oral tablets may be crushed or chewed and swallowed with a small amount of water; oral chewable tablets are also available for children or patients with swallowing difficulties.<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"923350-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>Fecal specimens; 3 weeks after treatment<\/li><li>Improvement in symptoms as well as resolution of active lesions or cysts indicates efficacy.<\/li><li>CBC (including a differential); at the beginning of each treatment cycle and every 2 weeks during treatment; more frequent monitoring in patients with liver disease or hepatic echinococcosis<\/li><li>Liver function tests (transaminases); at the beginning of each treatment cycle and at least every 2 weeks during treatment<\/li><li>Pregnancy test, in women of reproductive potential; prior to therapy initiation<\/li><li>Retinal lesions, in patients with neurocysticercosis; before therapy initiation<\/li><li>Evaluate patients with epidemiologic factors who are at risk for neurocysticercosis prior to initiating therapy for other indications; undiagnosed neurocysticercosis may be uncovered during treatment.<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"923350-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Albenza<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 200 MG<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"923350-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"923350-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>ALBENDAZOLE <\/b><br\/>USES: A benzimidazole carbamate anthelmintic agent, used for the treatment of parenchymal neurocysticercosis caused by Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and cystic hydatid disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus (dog tapeworm). PHARMACOLOGY: While its precise biochemical mechanism of action is not clear, it appears to cause selective degeneration of cytoplasmic microtubules in intestinal and tegmental cells of intestinal helminths  and their tissue-dwelling larvae. EPIDEMIOLOGY:  Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Limited overdose data. One patient reportedly ingested at least 16 g of albendazole over a 12-hour period. No clinical effects were reported. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects at therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Elevated liver enzymes, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and headaches are the most common adverse effects reported. INFREQUENT: Other effects that may occur less frequently include rashes, alopecia, leukopenia, dizziness\/vertigo, and increased intracranial pressure. RARE: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, fever, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, and acute dystonia have been rarely reported.
