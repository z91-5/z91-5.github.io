Intrathecal administration of leucovorin calcium has been associated with seizures, severe neurotoxicity and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: Allergic sensitization, anaphylactoid reactions, and urticaria have been reported. Anaphylactic reactions including shock have also been reported. OTHER: Most adverse effects reported with leucovorin calcium appear to occur when it is combined with 5-flourouracil (leucovorin calcium appears to enhance the toxicity of 5FU). The most commonly reported effects are leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis and alopecia.
