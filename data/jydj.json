Bactericidal activity occurs by: inhibition of transglycosylation (polymerization) of cell wall biosynthesis via oritavancin binding to the stem peptide of peptidoglycan precursors. Oritavancin also inhibits the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to cell wall peptide bridge segments, and disrupts the bacterial membrane integrity, which causes depolarization and permeabilization and cell death. Bactericidal activity of oritavancin is concentration dependent.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jydjs8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"1":{"id":"jydjs8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"<ul><li>Protein binding: 85%<\/li><li>Vd: 87.6 L<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"jydjs8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>not metabolized<\/li><li>inhibitor of 1A2, 2B6, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4<\/li><li>inducer of CYP3A4 and 2D6<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"jydjs8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Fecal: Less than 1% unchanged<\/li><li>Renal: Less than 5% unchanged<\/li><li>Dialyzable: No (hemodialysis)<\/li><li>Total body clearance: 0.445 L\/hr<\/li><\/ul>"},"4":{"id":"jydjs8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"245 hours <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"jydjs9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>use 3 vials for a 1200 mg dose<\/li><li>reconstitute each vial with 40 mL of sterile water for injection to produce concentration of 10 mg\/mL\/vial<\/li><li>swirl gently to avoid foaming<\/li><li>dilute only with D5W; do not use NS<\/li><li>after removing 120 mL from a 1000 mL bag of D5W, add 40 mL from each of the 3 reconstituted vials to yield 1.2 mg\/mL<\/li><li>do not mix with other drugs, additives, or solutions mixed in NS, or with basic or neutral pH drug solutions<\/li><li>combined storage time from dilution and reconstitution must not exceed 6 hours if stored at room temperature or 12 hours if refrigerated at 36 to 46 degrees F<\/li><li>do not administer simultaneously via IV lines or common IV ports with drugs or IV solutions mixed in NS<\/li><li>if other drugs or solutions are administered sequentially, flush the IV line prior to and after oritavancin<\/li><li>infuse over 3 hours<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jydjs10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>microbiological response (eg, cessation of spread or reduction in size of baseline lesion, absence of fever) or clinical response (eg, reduction in erythema, induration, purulent drainage, fluctuance, pain, tenderness, local heat or warmth) is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>hypersensitivity reactions; increased risk in patients with a history of glycopeptide allergy<\/li><li>signs or symptoms of osteomyelitis<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jydjs11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Orbactiv<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 400 MG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"jydjs13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Warn patient that serious allergic reactions may occur and require immediate medical attention.<\/li><li>Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, abscess, or infusion site reaction.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report severe watery or bloody diarrhea even when occurring after discontinuation of oritavancin.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
