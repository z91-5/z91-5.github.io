PHARMACOLOGY:  Zanamivir and oseltamivir are selective inhibitors of influenza A and B virus neuraminidase (sialidase).  Neuraminidase inhibitors are analogues of sialic acid, blocking the active site of neuraminidase and leaving uncleaved sialic acid residues on the surfaces of host cells and influenza viral envelopes. Viral hemagglutinin binds to uncleaved sialic acid residues, resulting in viral aggregation at the host cell surface and a reduction in the amount of virus released that can infect other cells. TOXICOLOGY: Toxic effects of neuraminidase inhibitors are often minimal and difficult to distinguish from the signs and symptoms of influenza infection. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Neuraminidase inhibitor overdose is rare and may occur due to therapeutic error. Severe toxicity from isolated ingestion is rarely reported. A majority of patients will have only mild symptoms. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: A majority of patients with neuraminidase inhibitor overdose will have only mild toxicity. Signs and symptoms commonly include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Pruritus, dizziness, and tremors have also been reported. SEVERE TOXICITY: In cases of severe toxicity, patients may very rarely develop neuropsychiatric illness including agitation, delirium, hallucinations, and psychosis. This appears to be common with high-dose therapy for critically ill patients with influenza, although whether the cause is directly due to oseltamivir toxicity or the underlying illness remains unclear. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Common mild adverse effects with therapeutic neuraminidase inhibitor use include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, transient elevation in hepatic enzymes, and exacerbation of bronchospasm in patients with underlying chronic respiratory disease. Uncommon adverse effects include dizziness, vertigo, dysrhythmias, syncope, bradycardia, hemorrhagic colitis, dermatitis, rash, eczema, urticaria, serious skin reactions (eg, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hepatitis, cough, dyspnea, bronchitis, seizures, confusion, agitation, anxiety, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, delirium, transient lymphopenia and neutropenia, and acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. It is often difficult to elicit which adverse effects may actually be due to the underlying illness rather than the neuraminidase inhibitor. <br\/>"},{"id":"925041-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is predominantly symptomatic and supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat agitation with benzodiazepines. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is typically not necessary for the treatment of neuraminidase inhibitors given the minimal toxicity associated. HOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is typically not necessary for the treatment of neuraminidase inhibitors given the minimal toxicity associated. Consider activated charcoal only if coingestants with significant toxicity are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients with neuraminidase inhibitor toxicity typically do not require intubation for the ingestion; however, it may be required for treatment of underlying influenza illness. Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status following significant overdose. Neuraminidase inhibitor serum concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful. Monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, CPK, and hepatic enzymes in patients with evidence of toxicity.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis has not been studied for neuraminidase inhibitor toxicity; however, given the drugs' very large volumes of distribution (16 to 26 L), it would not be expected to be useful.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with known large ingestions, should be observed for 6 hours for signs of toxicity. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop persistent GI symptoms with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may require admission to the hospital for hydration and antiemetics. Patients with suspected neuropsychiatric symptoms may require admission for symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines and monitoring. CONSULT CRITERIA: Contact a local poison center for a toxicology consult for any patient with suspected neuraminidase inhibitor toxicity with more than mild symptoms.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"925041-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: In clinical trials, oseltamivir oral doses up to 1000 mg have resulted only in nausea and vomiting.
