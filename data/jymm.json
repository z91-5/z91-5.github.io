Avoid use in patients with an increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma (eg, Paget disease of bone, unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, pediatric and young adults with open epiphyses, hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma, and history of external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton).
