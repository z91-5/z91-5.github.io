PHARMACOLOGY: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that prevents cell division by cross-linking DNA strands and thus decreasing DNA synthesis. It is a prodrug that is metabolized in the liver and has active metabolites. TOXICOLOGY: After overdose, the effects of decreased DNA synthesis and cell death are noticed primarily in organ systems with rapidly dividing cells (bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract). EPIDEMIOLOGY: Acute cyclophosphamide poisoning is rare. The incidence of cyclophosphamide toxicity during therapeutic use varies depending on the dosage and the length of duration of therapy and sequential or concurrent use of other cytotoxic drugs, and some toxic effects (ie, cystitis) are far more common than pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis. OVERDOSE: Overdose reports are limited. Severe left ventricular dysfunction, pleural and pericardial effusion, and myelosuppression have been reported. An extension of adverse effects (ie, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis) should be expected. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most common effects observed include alopecia, which usually starts 3 weeks after therapy, effects on fertility (ie, irreversible sterility, amenorrhea), gastrointestinal effects (ie, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, mucositis, stomatitis), a potentially fatal acute hemorrhagic cystitis (in up to 40% of patients), and myelosuppression. Less common effects in patients include facial flushing, headache, skin rashes, SIADH, and renal tubular necrosis. RARE: Rare but life-threatening side effects include cardiac effects (ie, congestive heart failure, cardiac necrosis, and hemorrhagic myocarditis), pulmonary effects (ie, interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), anaphylactic reactions, hepatotoxicity, electrolyte imbalances, renal injury, secondary malignancy, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic (FDA pregnancy category D) and long-term use is associated with an increased risk of a variety of malignancies.<br\/>"},{"id":"151588-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: For mild or moderate toxicity from overdose, supportive care should be sufficient. Treat persistent nausea and vomiting with several antiemetics of different classes. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Patients with severe neutropenia should be placed in protective isolation. Bladder toxicity may be ameliorated by hydration and forced diuresis, and the concurrent administration of MESNA (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate), which inactivates the toxic metabolite acrolein in the urine. Formalin 5% to 10% instilled into the bladder can also be used for less severe cystitis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also been used for hemorrhagic cystitis. SIADH has been treated by fluid restriction and furosemide. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity from cyclophosphamide requires good supportive care, which might require an ICU setting. Administer colony stimulating factors (filgrastim or sargramostim) as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Patients with severe neutropenia should be placed in protective isolation. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hemorrhage. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Bladder toxicity may be ameliorated by hydration and forced diuresis, and the concurrent administration of MESNA (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate), which inactivates the toxic metabolite acrolein in the urine. Formalin 5% to 10% instilled into the bladder can also be used for less severe cystitis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also been used for hemorrhagic cystitis. SIADH has been treated by fluid restriction and furosemide.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital charcoal would be reasonable if it could be given within a few hours of ingestion and the patient was not vomiting. Standard decontamination (eg, washing skin with soap and water, irrigation of eyes with water) would be reasonable for other routes of exposure. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal would be reasonable if it can be administered soon after the ingestion. Although general guidelines recommend treating only if the patient presents within 60 minutes of the ingestion, the potential severity of cyclophosphamide ingestions warrants consideration of late administration. Gastric lavage should be considered in suicidal ingestions of cyclophosphamide, as there is no specific antidote, but should be reserved for life-threatening ingestions that have occurred recently (eg, within the last hour). There is no evidence to support the use of whole bowel irrigation or multiple doses of activated charcoal.<\/li><li>Airway management: Intubate if patient is unable to protect airway or if unstable dysrhythmias develop.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Administer colony stimulating factors as these patients are at risk for severe neutropenia. Filgrastim: 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or subQ. Sargramostim: 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV over 4 hours. Monitor CBC with differential for evidence of bone marrow suppression. If fever or infection develop during leukopenic phase, cultures should be obtained and appropriate antibiotics started. Transfusion of platelets and\/or packed red cells may be needed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia or hemorrhage. Patients with severe neutropenia should be in protective isolation. Transfer to a bone marrow transplant center should be considered.<\/li><li>Neutropenia: Prophylactic therapy with a fluoroquinolone should be considered in high risk patients with expected prolonged (more than 7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC 100 cells\/mm(3) or less).<\/li><li>Febrile neutropenia: If fever (38.3 C) develops during the neutropenic phase (ANC 500 cells\/mm(3) or less), cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics started. HIGH RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of 7 days or more; unstable; significant comorbidities): IV monotherapy with either piperacillin-tazobactam; a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin); or an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent (eg, ceftazidime or cefepime). LOW RISK PATIENT (anticipated neutropenia of less than 7 days; clinically stable; no comorbidities): oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\/clavulanate.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Doses of cyclophosphamide greater than 1500 mg\/m(2) have a high emetic risk. Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Hemorrhagic cystitis: Bladder toxicity may be ameliorated by hydration and forced diuresis, and the concurrent administration of MESNA (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate), which inactivates the toxic metabolite acrolein in the urine. MESNA can be given by IV bolus at 40% to 60% of the cyclophosphamide dose (w\/w), immediately after exposure and then at 3, 6, and 9 hours. Formalin 5% to 10% instilled into the bladder can also be used for less severe cystitis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also been used for hemorrhagic cystitis.<\/li><li>Syndrome of inappropriate vasopressin secretion: Treatment of SIADH is supportive.  Restrict fluids to 1 L\/day or less.  Furosemide inhibits free water reabsorption more than it increases sodium, potassium and chloride excretion. Dosing should be adjusted to achieve a negative fluid balance. <\/li><li>Stomatitis: Treat mild mucositis with bland oral rinses with 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. For moderate cases with pain, consider adding a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, dyclonine, diphenhydramine, or doxepin). Treat moderate to severe mucositis with topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics. Patients with mucositis and moderate xerostomia may receive sialagogues (eg, sugarless candy\/mints, pilocarpine\/cevimeline, or bethanechol) and topical fluorides to stimulate salivary gland function. Consider prophylactic antiviral and antifungal agents to prevent infections. Topical oral antimicrobial mouthwashes, rinses, pastilles, or lozenges may be used to decrease the risk of infection. Palifermin is indicated to reduce the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support. In patients with severe cyclophosphamide overdose, administer palifermin 60 mcg\/kg\/day IV bolus injection starting 24 hours after the overdose for 3 consecutive days. <\/li><li>Extravasation injury: If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion. Disconnect the IV tubing, but leave the cannula or needle in place. Attempt to aspirate the extravasated drug from the needle or cannula. If possible, withdraw 3 to 5 mL of blood and\/or fluids through the needle\/cannula. Administer sodium thiosulfate (see dosing below). Elevate the affected area. Apply ice packs for 15 to 20 minutes at least 4 times daily. Another source recommended warm\/heat compresses for local reaction. Administer analgesia for severe pain. If pain persists, there is concern for compartment syndrome, or injury is apparent, an early surgical consult should be considered. Close observation of the extravasated area is suggested. If tissue sloughing, necrosis or blistering occurs, treat as a chemical burn (ie, antiseptic dressings, silver sulfadiazine, antibiotics when applicable). Surgical or enzymatic debridement may be required. Risk of infection is increased in chemotherapy patients with reduced neutrophil count following extravasation. Consider culturing any open wounds. Monitor the site for the development of cellulitis, which may require antibiotic therapy. SODIUM THIOSULFATE (SODIUM HYPOSULFITE) 10%: Prepare a 0.17 moles\/L solution by mixing 4 mL sodium thiosulfate 10% weight\/volume with 6 mL sterile water for injection. Inject into extravasation site.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available; information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial CBC with differential and platelet count until there is evidence of bone marrow recovery. Neutrophil and platelet nadirs typically occur 7 to 15 days following therapeutic doses and recovery is generally in 3 to 4 weeks. Monitor for signs of bleeding. Monitor for clinical evidence of infection, with particular attention to: odontogenic infection, oropharynx, esophagus, soft tissues particularly in the perirectal region, exit and tunnel sites of central venous access devices, upper and lower respiratory tracts, and urinary tract.  Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor BUN, serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and liver enzymes. Monitor urinalysis (for hemorrhagic cystitis) and urine output. Obtain a chest radiograph and ECG in patients with cardiopulmonary complaints. Cyclophosphamide concentrations can be performed but are not likely to be available in a timely manner and cannot be used to guide therapy.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are moderately dialyzable (20% to 50%) but there are no reports of dialysis after overdose. It should be considered if it can be performed early after a large overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no data to support home management. Even inadvertent exposures via oral ingestion that are asymptomatic should be sent in for charcoal administration to prevent further sequelae. All intentional overdoses should be sent in for evaluation. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Exposed patients should be evaluated and observed for 6 hours. If patients are asymptomatic for 6 hours, they may be sent home, but toxic effects may be delayed, so patients should return to a health care provider for any symptoms and should have blood work monitored as an outpatient (eg, CBC for myelosuppression). ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any symptomatic patient and any high dose parenteral overdoses should be admitted to the hospital, and depending on the severity of their symptoms, either to the floor or ICU. Criteria for discharge should be resolution of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult an oncologist, medical toxicologist and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with an overdose. TRANSFER CRITERIA: Patients with large overdoses or severe neutropenia may benefit from early transfer to a cancer treatment or bone marrow transplant center.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"151588-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Even with therapeutic dosing, toxicity is expected.
