Alosetron is indicated for women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. PHARMACOLOGY: These agents are selective serotonin 5-HT3-type receptor antagonists. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: DOLASETRON: An intentional ingestion of 2 g of dolasetron produced severe hypotension, first degree AV block, QRS widening and a prolonged QTc interval in an adult. Overdose of IV dolasetron has resulted in hypotension, dizziness, and abnormal ECG. GRANISETRON: No symptoms or only the occurrence of a slight headache have been reported with overdosage of up to 38.5 mg of granisetron hydrochloride injection. ONDANSETRON: Overdose has caused fever, rashes, pruritus, restlessness, CNS depression, self-limited seizures, tachycardia, mild elevations in liver enzymes, hypotension, temporary blindness (2 to 3 minutes duration) and a constellation of findings consistent with serotonin syndrome. A toddler developed somnolence, tachycardia, hyperreflexia, seizure activity, airway obstruction, rash, transiently elevated liver enzymes, and a prolonged QTc interval after inadvertently ingesting 7 to 8 tablets of 8-mg ondansetron (an estimated 5.6 to 6.4 mg\/kg). ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects after therapeutic doses include: constipation or diarrhea, dry mouth, fever, musculoskeletal pain, rash, injection site reactions, burning sensations, hot flashes, hypokalemia, transient blurred vision and loss of vision, transient elevations of liver enzymes, seizures, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, sedation, extrapyramidal reactions, tachycardia, chest pain, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. ECG abnormalities, including QT prolongation, ST segment depression, and second degree atrioventricular block have been reported with ondansetron IV injection. A child with known susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH) developed an MH-like syndrome 3 hours after receiving ondansetron and died. <br\/>"},{"id":"924978-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ONDANSETRON AND RELATED DRUGS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Treat severe hypotension IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Therapeutic doses of ondansetron may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of ondansetron and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, severe allergic reactions, or persistent seizures.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Therapeutic doses of ondansetron may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of ondansetron and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, atrial overdrive pacing may be necessary.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULTS: 1 to 2 g IV (mixed in 50 to 100 mL D5W) infused over 5 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILDREN: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Rates of 100 to 120 beats\/min may terminate torsades. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, mental status, and liver enzymes following an overdose. Obtain a baseline ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring after significant overdose. Based on limited data, AV block, QRS widening, and QTc prolongation have developed in overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are not expected to be of benefit because of the large volumes of distribution of ondansetron and hydrodolasetron (active metabolite of dolasetron).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A child with an inadvertent exposure to 1 or 2 tablets, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with unstable vital signs, persistent cardiac dysrhythmias, mental status changes, and persistent seizures should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924978-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ONDANSETRON AND RELATED DRUGS <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The minimum lethal human dose for these agents has not been delineated. ALOSETRON: In clinical trials, individual alosetron doses as large as 16 mg orally (8 times higher than the recommended total daily dose) did not result in significant adverse effects. DOLASETRON: Individual doses as large as 5 mg\/kg IV or 400 mg orally have been safely given to healthy volunteers or cancer patients. A patient developed severe hypotension, QRS widening and QTc interval prolongation following an intentional dose of 2000 mg; clinical effects resolved completely with supportive care. GRANISETRON: No symptoms or only the occurrence of a slight headache have been reported with overdosage of up to 38.5 mg of granisetron hydrochloride injection. ONDANSETRON: Individual doses of 145 mg and a total daily dose of 252 mg in 3 divided doses (more than 10 times the recommended daily dose) have been administered IV without significant adverse effects. A toddler developed somnolence, tachycardia, hyperreflexia, seizure activity, airway obstruction, rash, transiently elevated liver enzymes and a prolonged QTc interval after inadvertently ingesting 7 to 8 tablets of 8-mg ondansetron (an estimated 5.6-6.4 mg\/kg). Symptoms resolved with intensive supportive care. An 8-year-old boy developed hypotension after ingesting 15 ondansetron 4-mg oral tablets (1.25 mg\/kg). He recovered following supportive care. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: ALOSETRON: ADULT: 0.5 to 1 mg twice daily. DOLASETRON: ADULT: 100 mg given orally 1 hr prior to chemotherapy; IV 1.8 mg\/kg given as a single dose approximately 30 min before chemotherapy. Maximum dose: 100 mg.
