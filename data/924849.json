PHARMACOLOGY: By reversibly inhibiting alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes which are located in the brush border of the small intestine, miglitol delays the hydrolysis of ingested complex sugars. By slowing the breakdown of oligosaccharides and disaccharides into monosaccharides, this action slows the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream and thus reduces postprandial hyperglycemia. Miglitol has minor inhibitory activity against lactase but is not expected to cause lactose intolerance. TOXICOLOGY: Based on its mechanism of action, miglitol when administered alone should NOT cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Miglitol given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin can cause a further lowering of blood glucose; it may increase the hypoglycemic potential of these agents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: Overdose data are limited. Miglitol overdose will not cause hypoglycemia. However, transient increases in flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort may occur. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain. OTHER EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, low serum iron (not associated with reductions in hemoglobin or other hematologic indices). HYPOGLYCEMIA: Based on its mechanism of action, miglitol should NOT cause hypoglycemia when administered alone in the fasting or postprandial state.  Miglitol when given in combination with sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and increase the hypoglycemic potential of these medications. <br\/>"},{"id":"924849-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MIGLITOL <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Miglitol alone does not cause hypoglycemia; however, concomitant administration of miglitol and other antidiabetic agents (eg, insulin, sulfonylureas) may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitor blood glucose frequently in patients who have taken an overdose of miglitol and insulin or sulfonylureas.  MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Severe toxicity is not expected after overdose of miglitol. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea. Miglitol alone does not cause hypoglycemia; however, concomitant administration of miglitol and other antidiabetic agents (eg, insulin, sulfonylureas) may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitor blood glucose frequently in patients who have taken an overdose of miglitol and insulin or sulfonylureas..  Refer to &quot;SULFONYLUREA AND RELATED AGENTS&quot; for specific treatment information.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is not expected, GI decontamination is generally not indicated unless other more toxic co-ingestants are involved. HOSPITAL: Severe toxicity is not expected, GI decontamination is generally not indicated unless other more toxic co-ingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Should not be required in these cases. COMBINATION OVERDOSE: The airway may need to be protected in patients with coma that persists after serum glucose correction.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypoglycemia: Miglitol alone does not cause hypoglycemia; however, concomitant administration of miglitol and other antidiabetic agents (eg, insulin, sulfonylureas) may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitor blood glucose frequently in these patients.  Intravenous dextrose will initially reverse hypoglycemia (if symptomatic or BS less 60 mg\/dL; 50 mL of 50% dextrose in adults; in children 0.5 to 1 g\/kg of 25% dextrose in water (D25W 2 to 4 mL\/kg\/dose)). Refer to &quot;SULFONYLUREA AND RELATED AGENTS&quot; for specific treatment information.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor blood glucose in patients who have taken miglitol overdose along with a sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Severe toxicity is not expected thus hemodialysis is not indicated. Miglitol has a protein binding of less than 4% and a volume of distribution of 0.18 L\/kg (consistent with distribution primarily into the extracellular fluid). Theoretically, hemodialysis would be effective in clearing miglitol.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"924849-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>MIGLITOL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A minimum toxic dose has not been established.
