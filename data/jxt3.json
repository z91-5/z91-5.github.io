Elevated intracellular cGMP stimulates the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen, causing an increase in intestinal fluid and faster transit.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jxt3s8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"jxt3s8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Bioavailability, Oral: low<\/li><li>Effect of food: unknown<\/li><\/ul>"},"2":{"id":"jxt3s8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"<ul><li>Gastrointestinal tract: primary route<\/li><li>Principal peptide metabolite: active<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"jxt3s8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Fecal: 3% to 5%; changed <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"jxt3s9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>administer 30 minutes prior to first meal of the day<\/li><li>swallow whole; do not break or chew<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jxt3s10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"no specific monitoring has been determined<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"jxt3s11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Linzess<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule: 145 MCG, 290 MCG<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"jxt3s13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Instruct patient to not allow children under 18 years of age access to the drug, as harm may result if they take the drug.<\/li><li>This drug may cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, or headache.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to report severe diarrhea, especially if accompanied by hematochezia or melena.<\/li><li>Patient should swallow capsule whole once daily on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
