Ursodiol is also used for the prevention of gallstone formation in obese patients experiencing rapid weight loss. PHARMACOLOGY: Chenodiol (chenodeoxycholic acid) and ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) are naturally occurring bile acids. Hepatic synthesis of cholesterol and cholic acid is suppressed by chenodiol. Suppression of cholic acid and the metabolite, deoxycholic acid lead to desaturation of biliary cholesterol, which leads to gradual dissolution of radiolucent cholesterol gallstones in the gall bladder. Chenodiol has no effects on radiopaque (calcified) gallstones or radiolucent bile pigment stones. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: At the time of this review, there is no acute overdose data available. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects (eg, diarrhea) observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: CHENODIOL: Dose-related diarrhea is the most common adverse effect of chenodiol. Nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, heartburn, anorexia, dyspepsia, and elevated liver enzymes are less frequently reported side effects associated with chenodiol therapy. Serious hepatic disease may occasionally occur in patients treated with chenodiol. URSODIOL: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, itching, hypersensitivity reaction, backache, dizziness, cough, and pharyngitis have been reported. Chenodiol has the pregnancy category X. <br\/>"},{"id":"116285-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CHENODIOL AND RELATED AGENTS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.

Doses varies by weight (body weight 100 to 275 pounds): 750 mg (17 to 13 mg\/kg) to 1750 mg (18 to 14 mg\/kg) orally once a day in 2 divided doses. URSODIOL: Chemodissolution of bile duct stone: 8 to 10 mg\/kg\/day orally divided into 2 to 3 doses.
