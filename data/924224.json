PHARMACOLOGY:  The exact mechanism is unknown. It's postulated that anagrelide reduces platelet production by decreasing megakaryocyte hypermaturation (size and ploidy and disrupting or preventing full megakaryocyte maturation). Anagrelide inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase activity with subsequent increases in cAMP levels in the platelets. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Hypotension has been reported with higher than recommended doses. Postmarketing data has reported the occurrence of sinus tachycardia and vomiting following overdose. In general, it is anticipated that overdose effects are an extension of adverse effects observed with therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse events following therapeutic administration, at an incidence of at least 5% during clinical trials, are headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, edema, palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, flatulence, fever, rash, anorexia, tachycardia, paresthesia, back pain, pruritus, and dyspepsia. INFREQUENT: Adverse effects that were reported less frequently include: congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, vasodilatation, postural hypotension, QT interval prolongation, constipation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastritis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ecchymosis, elevated liver enzymes, arthralgia, myalgia, confusion, somnolence, insomnia, epistaxis, pneumonia, alopecia, diplopia, tinnitus, hematuria, and renal failure. RARE: Torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and interstitial lung diseases, including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial pneumonitis, have been rarely reported during post-marketing surveillance.<br\/>"},{"id":"924224-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ANAGRELIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine, if unresponsive to fluids. Monitor serial CBC with differential. Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia and\/or bleeding. Therapeutic doses of anagrelide may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of anagrelide and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities, overdrive pacing may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and the patient is able to maintain their airway. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and the airway can be maintained.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe respiratory symptoms or severe bleeding.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Therapeutic doses of anagrelide may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of anagrelide and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, atrial overdrive pacing may be necessary. Correct electrolyte abnormalities (ie, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULT: 1 to 2 g IV (mixed in 50 to 100 mL D5W) infused over 5 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILD: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Rates of 100 to 120 beats\/min may terminate torsades. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs following overdose. Obtain periodic complete blood counts, including platelet counts. Monitor for clinical evidence of bleeding.  In one study, the mean time to reach a nadir in platelet counts was approximately 18 days (range, 13 to 26 days). Obtain an ECG, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Obtain a chest x-ray in any patient with respiratory symptoms. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe symptoms despite treatment should be admitted.
