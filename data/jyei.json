PHARMACOLOGY: Naloxegol is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist derivative of naloxone that is specific to peripheral tissues (eg, gastrointestinal tract) due to pegylation that decreases passive permeability and CNS penetration at recommended dosages. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea have been reported in patients receiving twice the recommended dose of naloxegol. The overdose effects of naloxogel on opioid-naive patients are unknown. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (3% AND GREATER): Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting, headache, and hyperhidrosis. OTHER EFFECTS: Joint pain, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and withdrawal symptoms. DRUG INTERACTION: Concurrent use of naloxegol and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, diltiazem, erythromycin, verapamil) can increase plasma concentration of naloxegol and increase the risk of adverse effects. Concurrent use of naloxegol and grapefruit or grapefruit juice can also increase plasma concentration of naloxegol and increase the risk of adverse effects.  Concurrent use of naloxegol and another opioid antagonist can result in an additive effect of opioid receptor antagonism and increase the risk of opioid withdrawal. <br\/>"},{"id":"jyeis12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>NALOXEGOL<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Monitor patients for symptoms of opioid withdrawal (eg, chills, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis or reversal of central analgesic effect).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is very unlikely to be necessary unless other toxic agents have been administered concurrently.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged home if psychiatrically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Hospital admission is rarely necessary. Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jyeis12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>NALOXEGOL<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: In one study, gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea) developed in patients with opioid-induced constipation within 1 to 2 days of using naloxegol 50 mg daily (twice the recommended dosage).
