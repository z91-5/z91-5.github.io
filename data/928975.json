PHARMACOLOGY: Aliskiren directly inhibits renin which decreases plasma renin activity (PRA) and inhibits the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) which indirectly increase levels of PRA, aliskiren reduces PRA, Ang I, and Angiotensin II (Ang II) by directly inhibiting renin. These reductions occur whether or not aliskiren is used as monotherapy or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents. It is unknown if aliskiren has an effect on other renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) components. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. The main effect expected with aliskiren overdose would be hypotension. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Aliskiren is generally well tolerated by most patients. Adverse effects reported with aliskiren therapy include hypotension (rare), diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal reflux disease, dizziness, headache, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. Most symptoms were dose-related, mild, and rarely led to discontinuation of therapy.<br\/><\/li><li><b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/>USES: Class of drugs that are primarily used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Potassium sparing diuretics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Work in a variety of mechanisms including inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (thiazides), inhibiting transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle (loop), and osmotic agents (mannitol). TOXICOLOGY: Produce hypovolemia and electrolyte deficiencies. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Rare overdose which uncommonly results in significant morbidity or death. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild dehydration, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, headache, muscle cramps, thirst, and brisk diuresis. Large doses of furosemide or ethacrynic acid can cause ototoxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, mental status changes, and electrolyte abnormalities (i.e. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia) are the most common manifestations of severe poisoning. Rarely muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, coma, or dysrhythmias may develop secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities.  CNS depression has been reported rarely in children with acute ingestion without significant electrolyte abnormalities. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Thiazides are associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Furosemide has been associated with ototoxicity, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  Diuretics have a large number of drug interactions as well. Extravasation of mannitol can cause tissue injury and compartment syndrome.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928975-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ALISKIREN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
