Nelarabine is demethylated by adenosine deaminase to ara-G, mono-phosphorylated by deoxyguanosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase, and then converted to the active 5' -triphosphate, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in leukemic blasts allows for its incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death.
