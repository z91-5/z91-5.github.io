It is also used to treat anticoagulant-induced prothrombin deficiency caused by coumarin or indanedione derivatives and hypoprothrombinemia secondary to antibacterial therapy, salicylates, obstructive jaundice or biliary fistulas. Vitamin K3 (menadione) is no longer available in the US. PHARMACOLOGY: Phytonadione (vitamin K1), a 2-methyl-3-phytyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone, has the same activity as naturally occurring vitamin K1. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the posttranslational carboxylation of multiple, specific peptide bound glutamine acid residues in inactive hepatic precursors of factors, II, VII, IX and X which converts the precursors into active coagulation factors that are subsequently secreted by liver cells into the blood. In healthy individuals, oral phytonadione is virtually devoid of pharmacodynamic activity, however, if an individual is deficient in vitamin K, the administration of vitamin K will promote the hepatic biosynthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. TOXICOLOGY: Phytonadione is not a clotting agent, but excessive therapy with vitamin K may reproduce the underlying conditions that caused the thromboembolic event. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is uncommon; premature neonates may be at greatest risk to develop hemolysis or hyperbilirubinemia following a parenteral overdose. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose events are anticipated to be similar to adverse events reported with therapy. Events that may require intervention are likely due to parenteral administration. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe hypersensitivity and\/or anaphylaxis, including fatalities, can occur with parenteral exposure. ADVERSE EVENTS: Most adverse events have been reported with parenteral administration. Transient flushing, alterations in taste, dizziness, diaphoresis, dyspnea, brief hypotension and cyanosis have occurred with parenteral administration. NEONATES: The parenteral product contains aluminum and benzyl alcohol, which may produce toxicity following prolonged exposure in premature neonates. Hyperbilirubinemia (rare finding) has occurred following parenteral administration in premature infants, usually due to excessive dosing. INJECTION SITE: Pain, swelling and tenderness can occur at the injection site. SEVERE ADVERSE EVENT: INTRAVENOUS or INTRAMUSCULAR USE: Reactions typically resemble hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis, including shock and cardiac and\/or respiratory arrest can develop. Fatalities have occurred. Therefore, IV or IM use should be restricted to those situations where SubQ administration is not feasible and the benefit outweighs the risk. Acute cardiovascular collapse, appears to be related to rapid rates of infusion (greater than 1 mg\/min) in most cases. <br\/>"},{"id":"a02is12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>VITAMIN K <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Toxicity is unlikely to occur following oral exposure. Hypersensitivity Reaction: Mild to moderate allergic reactions may be treated with antihistamines with or without inhaled beta adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. ANAPHYLAXIS: Treatment for severe anaphylaxis includes oxygen supplementation, aggressive airway management, epinephrine, ECG monitoring and IV fluids. HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Neonates, especially premature neonates, may be at risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia and hemolysis following inadvertent parenteral overdose.  Exchange transfusion may be necessary. NEWBORNS. The parenteral formulation contains aluminum. Excessive parenteral exposure may lead to aluminum toxicity. Neonates may also be at risk to develop toxicity from the preservative benzyl alcohol found in the parenteral formulation.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Adverse effects have not been reported following oral ingestion of vitamin K.  Activated charcoal is not indicated.

Monitor liver and\/or renal function tests in patients with signs or symptoms consistent with toxicity, or after massive parenteral overdose. Monitor CBC for evidence of hemolysis and anemia in patients receiving large doses phytonadione. Monitor for evidence of anaphylactoid reactions after parenteral administration.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children with a minor (5 mg) ingestion of vitamin K, and adults with inadvertent oral overdose can be safely monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose should be referred to a healthcare facility. Patients with parenteral overdose need to be monitored until symptoms resolve, in particular hypersensitivity reactions. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Admit patients that develop evidence of severe hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Inadvertent intravenous or intramuscular exposure may require intensive monitoring and care due to the risk of severe reactions (ie, shock, cardiac and\/or respiratory arrest).
