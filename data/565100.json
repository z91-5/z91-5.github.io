Potassium sparing diuretics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Work in a variety of mechanisms including inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (thiazides), inhibiting transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle (loop), and osmotic agents (mannitol). TOXICOLOGY: Produce hypovolemia and electrolyte deficiencies. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Rare overdose which uncommonly results in significant morbidity or death. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild dehydration, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, headache, muscle cramps, thirst, and brisk diuresis. Large doses of furosemide or ethacrynic acid can cause ototoxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, mental status changes, and electrolyte abnormalities (i.e. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia) are the most common manifestations of severe poisoning. Rarely muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, coma, or dysrhythmias may develop secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities.  CNS depression has been reported rarely in children with acute ingestion without significant electrolyte abnormalities. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Thiazides are associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Furosemide has been associated with ototoxicity, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  Diuretics have a large number of drug interactions as well. Extravasation of mannitol can cause tissue injury and compartment syndrome.<br\/><\/li><li><b>POTASSIUM SPARING DIURETICS <\/b><br\/>USES: Potassium sparing diuretics are used to treat congestive heart failure, fluid retention from liver failure, and hypertension. Spironolactone is used to prevent amphotericin B-related hypokalemia in cancer patients, and in the management of neonatal chronic lung disease. PHARMACOLOGY: Amiloride acts by blocking the sodium channel in the later portion of the nephron, distal tubule, and collecting duct. Triamterene inhibits the reabsorption of sodium ions in the exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions in the segment of the distal tubule under the control of adrenal mineralocorticoids. Eplerenone and spironolactone bind to aldosterone receptors in the distal tubules and collecting duct, preventing the binding of aldosterone to its receptor. Aldosterone acts at the kidney to cause sodium and water retention and potassium loss in the urine. TOXICOLOGY: Overdose may cause dehydration due to the diuretic effect. It can also cause electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hyperkalemia. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Adverse effects during therapeutic use are relatively common. Potassium sparing diuretic overdose is rare and deaths have not been reported. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mild dehydration, and hyperkalemia may develop. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity has not been reported, but severe dehydration (tachycardia, hypotension, and possibly mental status changes) and hyperkalemia (which may cause dysrhythmias) should be expected. Acute renal failure has been reported from triamterene deposition in the renal tubules after overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Amiloride: Hyperkalemia, headache, paresthesia, depression, loss of libido, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps. Eplerenone: Hyperkalemia, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, coughing. Spironolactone: Hyperkalemia, acidosis, cramping, diarrhea, drowsiness, lethargy, ataxia, gynecomastia, impotence, irregular menses. Triamterene: Hyperkalemia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, interstitial nephritis, blood dyscrasias, nephrolithiasis, photodermatitis.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"565100-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>DIURETICS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Patients with minor symptoms can be managed with supportive care only.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Correct dehydration with intravenous fluids. There is a theoretical risk of hyperkalemia following overdose. Hyperkalemia is treated in the usual fashion: administer calcium chloride for dysrhythmias or wide complex rhythms. Sodium bicarbonate, insulin, glucose, and cationic exchange resins (eg, sodium polystyrene sulfonate) may also be used. Dialysis may be required for patients with impaired renal function.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not indicated.
