PHARMACOLOGY: Ofatumumab is a human IgG1-kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD20 molecule on normal B lymphocytes and on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, resulting in B-cell lysis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is very rare. TOXICITY: There are no reports of toxicity following acute overdose. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON (10% or greater): Rash, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, pneumonia, cough, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and fever. The following adverse effects have also been reported following therapeutic doses of ofatumumab: Hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, peripheral edema, urticaria, hyperhidrosis, obstruction of the small intestine, muscle spasm, back pain, insomnia, headache, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, chills, sepsis, multifocal leukoencephalopathy (some fatal), and infusion reactions.<br\/>"},{"id":"929517-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>OFATUMUMAB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
