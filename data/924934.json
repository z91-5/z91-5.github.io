PHARMACOLOGY: Cilostazol and its active metabolites inhibit phosphodiesterase activity and suppress degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) resulting in an increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels. It reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by various stimuli, including thrombin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, arachidonic acid, epinephrine, and shear stress. Cilostazol produces nonhomogenous vasodilation, with greater dilation in femoral beds than in vertebral, carotic, or superior mesenteric arteries, but without effect in renal arteries. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited.  Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Severe headache, diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, and possible dysrhythmias may occur with cilostazol overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Cilostazol is generally well tolerated by most patients.  COMMON: Headache, diarrhea, abnormal stools, palpitations, and dizziness. OTHER EFFECTS: Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, peripheral edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and back pain. RARE: Bleeding, tachycardia, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, dermatitis medicamentosa. There have been rare cases of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis when cilostazol was not immediately discontinued.

HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with serious toxicity or life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, severe bleeding (eg, intracranial bleeding or severe hemoptysis or upper GI bleeding).<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 mL to 20 mL\/kg, dopamine, norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: There have been rare cases of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis when cilostazol was not immediately discontinued. The agranulocytosis was reversible on discontinuation of cilostazol. Severe neutropenia: filgrastim 5 mcg\/kg\/day IV or SubQ or sargramostim 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day IV infused over 4 hours. Monitor serial CBC with differential. Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Ventricular arrhythmia: Ventricular tachycardia has rarely been reported in patients receiving cilostazol. However, a causal relationship could not be established. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring, obtain an ECG, and administer oxygen.  Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders.  Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, particularly in patients with underlying impaired cardiac function. Amiodarone should be used with caution if a substance that prolongs the QT interval and\/or causes torsades de pointes is involved in the overdose.  Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs, CBC with differential and platelet count following an overdose. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Monitor for evidence of bleeding (eg, venous access sites, urinary, gastrointestinal, vaginal). Monitor serial hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients with suspected bleeding. Obtain an ECG in symptomatic patients, and institute continuous cardiac monitoring.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with deliberate ingestions, a significant ingestion, or patients with comorbidities, should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation. All symptomatic patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for observation. Patients who are asymptomatic and who have normal bleeding time can be followed as an outpatient or on a psychiatric ward with twice daily check of their bleeding time. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  Patients with bleeding should be admitted. Patients with hypotension, or significant hemorrhage, should be admitted to an intensive care unit. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.
