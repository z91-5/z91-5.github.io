Xenon Xe 133 gas is chemically and physiologically related to elemental xenon, which has anesthetic properties at high doses. At doses used for diagnostic imaging, however, xenon Xe 133 is physiologically inactive.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"924412-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"4":{"id":"924412-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Cerebral vasculature: 5 minutes; pulmonary vasculature: 2 minutes <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"924412-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Inhalation<\/b><br\/><ul><li>handle with care and employ appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure to patients and clinical personnel<\/li><li>do not allow to stand in rubber tubing or respiratory containers<\/li><li>measure patient dose by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately before administration<\/li><li>administer by inhalation from closed (ie, leakproof) respiratory systems or spirometers<\/li><li>exhaled xenon Xe 133 gas should be controlled in compliance with appropriate governmental regulations<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"924412-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"no specific monitoring has been determined<br\/>"},"11":{"id":"924412-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Inhalation Gas: 10 MCI, 20 MCI<br\/>"}}}
