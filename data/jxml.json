Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi is indicated to treat patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase.  NOTE: Asparaginase should NOT be interchanged with Erwinia asparaginase or pegylated E. coli asparaginase because they may result in subtherapeutic blood levels of asparaginase or additional toxicity related to an overdose. PHARMACOLOGY: Asparaginase contains the enzyme L-asparagine amidohydrolase type EC-2, which is derived from Escherichia coli.  Asparaginase removes asparagine from leukemic cells (especially lymphoblasts) by hydrolysis to aspartic acid and  ammonia.  These cells depend upon an exogenous source of asparagine for survival. Normal cells, however, are able to synthesize asparagine and are less affected by the effects of asparaginase. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Limited overdose data available. Overdose effects are expected to be an extension of adverse effects reported with therapeutic use. Hyperammonemia, increased levels of glutamic and aspartic acid, and decreased levels of glutamine and asparagine were noted after a 10-fold overdose of asparaginase in a 3-year-old boy. The boy had no serious adverse effects and treatment with asparaginase was continued after a three day wash out period. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: The most commonly reported adverse reactions following therapeutic administration are allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), hyperglycemia, pancreatitis (sometimes fatal), thrombosis, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated liver enzymes. INFREQUENT: Other adverse effects reported less frequently include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, mucositis, hyperlipidemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperthermia, CNS depression, agitation, seizures, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, hallucinations, and hyperammonemia. RARE: Hyperkalemia and liver failure are rare occurrences.<br\/>"},{"id":"jxmls12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ASPARAGINASE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.  Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat agitation with benzodiazepines. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.  Monitor serial CBC with differential. For severe neutropenia, administer colony stimulating factor (eg; filgrastim, sargramostim). Transfusions as needed for severe thrombocytopenia.  In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports available, information derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free 0.9% saline).  Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hr).  Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hyperammonemia: Severe hyperammonemia may develop after large doses. Decrease nitrogen intake by administering a low protein diet with adequate carbohydrate and lipids to minimize endogenous protein catabolism. Sodium benzoate has been used in a case report to decrease ammonia production after asparaginase therapy or overdose, although controlled data is lacking. One dosing regimen is 250 mg\/kg\/day divided every 8 hours administered orally or intravenously.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial serum ammonia level and complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts after overdose. Monitor blood glucose and hepatic enzymes in patients with significant exposure. Monitor serum lipase in patients with abdominal pain or persistent vomiting. Fibrinogen levels, INR, PTT, and fibrin degradation products should be monitored in patients with evidence of bleeding or embolic complications. Monitor vital signs, including temperature, and mental status. Monitor fluid and electrolytes in patients with prolonged vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: It is unknown if hemodialysis would be effective in overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored until they are clearly improving and clinically stable. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe symptoms despite treatment should be admitted.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a regional poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jxmls12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ASPARAGINASE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
