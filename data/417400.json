PHARMACOLOGY: Nystatin binds to sterols in the fungal cell membrane, resulting in the cell membrane's inability to function as a selective barrier, thus allowing loss of essential cellular constituents. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Patients given doses greater than 5 million units daily developed only nausea and gastrointestinal upset. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Toxicity from orally administered nystatin is extremely low.  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and oral irritation have been reported with oral nystatin therapy. RARE: Acute allergic reaction, tachycardia, bronchospasm, facial swelling, skin rash, urticaria, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and nonspecific myalgia have rarely been reported. Severe vulvovaginitis has been reported following intravaginal nystatin therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"417400-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>NYSTATIN<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Significant toxicity is not expected after nystatin overdose. <\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Nystatin is minimally absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely.  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. HOSPITAL: Toxicity after acute ingestion is unlikely. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. Consider activated charcoal only if coingestants with significant toxicity are involved. <\/li><li>Airway management: Should not be required in these cases. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe allergic reaction.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Monitor airway. Administer antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is not recommended given the minimal systemic absorption and low toxicity of nystatin. <\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: A patient with an inadvertent exposure, that remains asymptomatic can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, need to be monitored for several hours to assess electrolyte and fluid balance and gastrointestinal function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Hospital admission is rarely necessary. Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"417400-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>NYSTATIN<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A minimum toxic dose has not been established, and significant toxicity is not expected after overdose.
