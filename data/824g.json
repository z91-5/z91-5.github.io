PHARMACOLOGY: Milrinone lactate along with amrinone belongs to the bipyridine inotropic\/vasodilator class of medications. It exerts its vasodilatory action by selectively inhibiting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-specific phosphodiesterase III isoenzyme in cardiac and smooth vascular muscle. The increase in vascular muscle AMP facilitates calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby reducing calcium stores available for myofibril contraction, with subsequent reduction of vascular tone. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses. Clinical effects in overdose include hypotension because of its vasodilator effect. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse effects reported with therapy include ventricular and supraventricular dysrhythmias, hypotension, angina\/chest pain, headache, bronchospasm, anaphylactic shock, elevated liver enzymes, rash, hypokalemia, tremor, and thrombocytopenia. Torsades de pointes is a rare occurrence with milrinone therapy. <br\/>"},{"id":"824gs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>MILRINONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine, if unresponsive to fluids.  Vasopressin has been effective in patients not responding to fluids and other pressors. Monitor CVP to help guide therapy. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias using ACLS protocols. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required. Monitor serial CBC with platelets; thrombocytopenia has been reported. Consider transfusions in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, hemodynamic instability, or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Tachycardia: If hemodynamic compromise develops secondary to tachycardia, consider esmolol or metoprolol.<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen.

Obtain an ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor renal function. Monitor CBC with platelet count following a significant overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a significant overdose should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted.
