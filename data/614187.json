Most available literature discusses the use of clavulanic acid as a combination product; therefore, the effects reported may not be directly related to clavulanic acid, but related to the penicillin used.  Refer to &quot;PENICILLINS&quot; management for more information. PHARMACOLOGY: Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus which has been shown to inhibit staphylococcal beta-lactamases and numerous beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative organisms. Clavulanic acid also inhibits beta-lactamases produced by Bacteroides species including B fragilis. When combined with beta-lactam antibiotics, the activity of the antibiotic is extended against beta-lactamase-producing organisms which would otherwise be resistant. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Most patients are asymptomatic or experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea following overdose with combination agents which contain amoxicillin\/clavulanic  acid.  Rash, hyperactivity, or drowsiness have occurred in a small number of patients.  ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, and\/or diarrhea are the most common (up to 30%) adverse effects seen with therapeutic oral use of clavulanic acid; these effects are dose-related. Other effects include electrolyte disturbances, dizziness, behavioral changes, urticaria-arthralgia, hypersensitivity reaction, rash, candidal vaginitis, non-thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombocytosis, neutropenia, and eosinophilia. Tachycardia and\/or hypotension may accompany systemic allergic reactions, which are rare. Liver injury, primarily cholestasis, has been reported. Persistent hepatic injury resulted in liver transplantation in a toddler after amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid therapy.<br\/><\/li><li><b>PENICILLIN<\/b><br\/>USES: Penicillins are used to treat gram-negative bacilli that can include second-generation (eg, ampicillin, amoxicillin), third-generation (eg, carbenicillin and ticarcillin), and fourth-generation penicillins (eg, piperacillin). PHARMACOLOGY: Penicillin is derived from the fungus penicillum. As a class, penicillins contain a 6 aminopenicillanic acid nucleus, composed of a beta-lactam ring fused to a 5 member thiazolidine ring. Penicillins and other beta-lactams inhibit cell wall mucopeptide synthesis. TOXICOLOGY: A penicillin can act as an agonist at the picrotoxin binding site causing GABA antagonism, CNS excitation and seizures. High doses of amoxicillin can cause crystal precipitation in the urine, with hematuria and renal insufficiency. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Penicillin overdose is relatively uncommon, but has the potential to produce severe toxicity. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea may develop with ingestion. Skin rashes and urticaria may develop, especially with amoxicillin and ampicillin ingestions. Hematuria, crystalluria and transient renal insufficiency have been reported after amoxicillin overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: Agitation, confusion, hallucinations, stupor, coma, multifocal myoclonus, seizures and encephalopathy may occur following massive doses of IV penicillins (40 to 100 million units\/day). Cardiac arrest and death have been associated with inadvertent intravenous administration of penicillin G (benzathine and procaine). Hyperkalemia may also develop. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: GASTROINTESTINAL: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric distress, and black hairy tongue are likely with orally administered penicillins. RENAL: Renal failure, crystalluria, interstitial nephritis, and hemorrhagic cystitis have been reported following the use of penicillin derivatives.Symptoms are frequently associated with sensitivity reactions and may include the following: DERMATOLOGY: Dermatologic reactions can vary greatly in severity, character, and distribution.  Amoxicillin and ampicillin appears to cause skin rashes more frequently than other penicillins. HEMATOLOGIC: Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have occurred following administration of the semisynthetic penicillins and may be related to a hypersensitivity reaction. SEVERE: Anaphylaxis may follow an exposure to any amount of penicillin; severe hypersensitivity reactions may result in anaphylaxis. Parenteral exposures are more likely to cause severe allergic reactions compared to an oral exposure. RARE: Penicillin-induced granulocytopenia is rare and has been associated with high-dose parenteral therapy.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"614187-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>CLAVULANIC ACID <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: ANAPHYLAXIS: Acute anaphylaxis is more likely to occur after parenteral exposure, but may develop with all routes. Administer oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids. SEIZURES: Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: GI decontamination is generally not necessary as toxicity is limited.

A number of children ingesting more than 250 mg\/kg of amoxicillin have developed crystalluria, hematuria and transient renal insufficiency; any patient who develops urinary symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose or with more than mild symptoms should be evaluated in a health care facility. All patients with a history of penicillin allergy or evidence of a hypersensitivity reaction should be referred immediately to a healthcare facility. Patients should be observed until symptoms resolve and clinical parameters (eg, vital signs, mental status) are within normal limits.

HOSPITAL: GI decontamination is unlikely to be necessary, administer activated charcoal if the ingestion is recent and toxic coingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is unlikely to be needed following an overdose; however, aggressive airway management is indicated in patients that develop a significant hypersensitivity\/anaphylactoid reaction.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no known antidote.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor renal function, urinalysis, and electrolytes following a significant overdose. Monitor fluid status in patients with severe vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Obtain a baseline ECG and institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with a significant IV overdose. Plasma levels of these antibiotics are not clinically useful in overdose situations.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: HEMODIALYSIS: Ampicillin-class antibiotics, amoxicillin and ticarcillin are removed from the circulation by hemodialysis, but as severe toxicity is highly unlikely hemodialysis is almost never indicated.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: Intrathecal injection has occurred rarely with penicillins. Treat seizures aggressively (benzodiapzepines, barbiturates, propofol). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage and CSF exchange may be useful after a large overdose. The following information is derived from limited case reports and experience with antineoplastic agents. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults.  Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative free normal saline or lactated ringers).  Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative free normal saline or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children with inadvertent ingestions of pediatric preparations can generally be managed at home. A small number of children ingesting more than 250 mg\/kg of amoxicillin have developed crystalluria, hematuria and transient renal insufficiency; any patient who develops urinary symptoms should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate overdose or with more than mild symptoms should be evaluated in a health care facility. All patients with a history of penicillin allergy or evidence of a hypersensitivity reaction should be referred immediately to a healthcare facility. Patients should be observed until symptoms resolve and clinical parameters (eg, vital signs, mental status) are within normal limits. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with ongoing symptoms should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in patients with persistent renal or cardiovascular symptoms.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"614187-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>CLAVULANIC ACID <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Amoxicillin\/Clavulanate - Most patients are asymptomatic following overdosage or experience only mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Clavulanic acid combinations are available in numerous formulations; total drug exposure is variable. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: Varies by indication and formulation: ADULTS: Amoxicillin\/clavulanate potassium: 500 or 875 mg orally every 12 hours or 250 or 500 mg orally every 8 hours, depending on the severity and type of infection. Ticarcillin disodium\/clavulanate potassium: Systemic and urinary tract infections: The recommended dose is 3.1 g every 4 to 6 hours, administered via an IV infusion over a 30-minute period. Gynecologic infections: Based on the ticarcillin component, the recommended dose is 200 to 300 mg\/kg\/day in divided doses every 4 to 6 hours, depending on the severity of infection, and administered via an IV infusion over a 30-minute period. CHILDREN: Amoxicillin\/clavulanate potassium: Based on the amoxicillin component, the amoxicillin\/clavulanate combination product is dosed as follows: ORAL: Neonates and infants less than 3 months of age: Using the 125 mg\/5 mL oral suspension of amoxicillin\/clavulanate potassium, the recommended dose is 30 mg\/kg\/day every 12 hours. 3 months or older and less than 40 kg: 25 to 45 mg\/kg\/day in divided doses every 12 hours, or 20 to 40 mg\/kg\/day in divided doses every 8 hours, depending on the severity of infection and product strength. 40 kg or more: 500 or 875 mg every 12 hours or 250 or 500 mg every 8 hours, depending on the severity and type of infection. Ticarcillin disodium\/clavulanate potassium: Based on the ticarcillin component, the ticarcillin\/clavulanate combination product is dosed as follows: INTRAVENOUS: Less than 60 kg: 200 to 300 mg\/kg\/day in divided doses every 4 to 6 hours, depending on the severity of infection, and administered via an IV infusion over a 30-minute period. 60 kg or more: 3.1 g every 4 to 6 hours, depending on the severity of infection, and administered via an IV infusion over a 30-minute period.<br\/><\/li><li><b>PENICILLIN <\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established. INTRAVENOUS: Agitation, confusion, hallucinations, stupor, coma multifocal myoclonus, seizures and encephalopathy may occur following massive doses of IV penicillins (40 to 100 million units\/day); patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk. AMOXICILLIN: ORAL: Serious toxicity is unlikely following large oral doses of amoxicillin. Acute renal failure has been described in a 3-year-old boy who ingested 574 mg\/kg of amoxicillin.
