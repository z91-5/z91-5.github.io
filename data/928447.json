PHARMACOLOGY: These agents decrease hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and increase peripheral glucose uptake. TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after acute overdose, as they do not stimulate insulin release. Severe lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially fatal side effect mainly in patients with renal insufficiency, hepatic disease, alcoholism, and advanced age. It can be precipitated by iodinated contrast agents. Metformin inhibits both hepatic lactate uptake and conversion of lactate to glucose. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common but severe toxicity is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and myalgia. Acute pancreatitis has been reported in one case report. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe lactic acidosis, confusion, mental status depression, hypothermia, hypotension, and renal failure may develop.  Rarely, ventricular dysrhythmias, respiratory insufficiency, and death. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal pain, anorexia, headache, and rash. SERIOUS EFFECTS: Lactic acidosis (generally only in patients with renal insufficiency or hepatic disease) and megaloblastic anemia. Hypotension, ventricular extrasystoles, and myocardial infarction have been reported with therapeutic doses. DRUG INTERACTION: Use of radiocontrast dyes in patients taking metformin increases the risk of renal failure and acidosis.  Concurrent use of metformin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of renal failure and acidosis.<br\/><\/li><li><b>THIAZOLIDINEDIONE ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS<\/b><br\/>USE: Oral hypoglycemic agents used to treat type II diabetes mellitus. PHARMACOLOGY: Decreases hepatic glucose production. Increases insulin sensitivity in the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and increases glucose uptake into adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after an acute overdose, although it has been reported after therapeutic use in patients also taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Mechanism of fluid retention and hepatotoxicity not elucidated. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common, rarely resulting in toxicity. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited human data, although hypoglycemia has been reported in clinical trials and animal studies. SEVERE TOXICITY: Minimal human data. Peripheral edema, congestive heart failure and hepatotoxicity have been reported after chronic therapy, but not after acute overdose. Its anticipated that effects may be similar to adverse effects reported during therapeutic use. ADVERSE EFFECTS: THIAZOLIDINEDIONES: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight gain, hypotension, hypertension, macular edema, edema, transaminitis, anemia, loss of bone density and hypersensitivity reactions can occur. SEVERE EFFECTS: Liver failure, bladder tumors, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, bladder tumors and Stevens-Johnson syndrome can develop. PIOGLITAZONE: The following have occurred with therapy: edema, hypoglycemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, paresthesia, and elevations of creatine phosphokinase. ROSIGLITAZONE: Headache, respiratory tract infection, fluid retention, weight gain, anemia, hepatic failure and hepatocellular injury have been reported. Based on previous postmarketing experience, myocardial ischemic events were associated with angina or myocardial infarction. In 2013, the FDA determined that rosiglitazone does not produce an increase risk of myocardial infarction compared to other antidiabetic (ie, metformin and sulfonylurea) agents. Limitations on prescribing and dispensing recommendations have been removed. However, ongoing monitoring of rosiglitazone will continue to assess and evaluate for any increase in myocardial ischemic events.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Early intubation and ventilation assistance should be performed if the patient presents with respiratory or mental status depression. Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if patient presents with circulatory collapse. If the patient develops severe anion gap metabolic acidosis or severe lactic acidosis (pH 7.1 or less), intravenous sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq\/kg IV bolus starting dose, then titrate to correct pH to above 7.2) should be given and emergent hemodialysis should be arranged (especially if renal insufficiency exists).<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be considered after large ingestions, if the patient has an appropriate level of consciousness, patent airway, and the patient can drink the charcoal.

Monitor renal function and liver enzymes.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis  is effective in improving acid-base status and may improve clinical outcome in patients with severe lactic acidosis, especially in patients with renal insufficiency, however, it does not remove significant amounts of metformin because of its large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children with acute inadvertent ingestions of 1700 mg or less may be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Four to 6 hours of observation period is recommended after immediate-release metformin overdose. Peak concentrations of delayed-release formulations are expected to be delayed after overdose. After an overdose, patients should be observed for the development of toxic effects for 2 to 6 hours longer than the Tmax (Tmax: Glucophage XR 7 hours, Glumetza extended-release: 7 to 8 hours. Fortamet extended-release: 6 hours). Patients who remain asymptomatic during this period with no evidence of metabolic acidosis or hypoglycemia can be discharged home. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity, or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>THIAZOLIDINEDIONE ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive care is the mainstay of treatment in patients who present with mild to moderate thiazolidinedione toxicity. If hypoglycemia develops, coingestion of other hypoglycemic agents should be considered. Hypoglycemia with thiazolidinediones is uncommon, but they are often prescribed with other antidiabetic agents that can produce hypoglycemia. A 4 to 6 hour observation period is reasonable. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Early positive pressure ventilation\/intubation should be performed if the patient presents with pulmonary edema. Consider diuresis in massive fluid overload. Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if a patient presents with circulatory collapse.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered after a large ingestion, if the patient is alert and cooperative and able to protect their airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient presents early after a large ingestion and the airway is protected. Lavage is of limited benefit.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe symptoms who present with respiratory insufficiency, consider positive pressure ventilation if tolerated.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote. If hypoglycemia occurs, treat with IV dextrose.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain a baseline blood glucose level and monitor frequently; especially when coadministered with other antidiabetic agents. Monitor hepatic enzymes following a significant overdose. Monitor vital signs, blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte status as indicated. Plasma volume expansion has been reported which may exacerbate heart failure.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is ineffective because of extensive protein binding and large volume of distribution of these agents.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic individuals with acute inadvertent ingestions may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: A 4 to 6 hour observation period is recommended after a large or deliberate thiazolidinedione overdose. Patients who remain asymptomatic during this period with no hypoglycemia may be discharged home after appropriate psychiatric clearance as indicated. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe liver injury or evidence of fluid overload should be admitted.

ADULT: In adults, ingestions of 5 g or less are generally well tolerated. Severe toxicity developed after ingestions of 25 or more of metformin. A woman ingested 75 to 100 grams of metformin and developed severe lactic acidosis. Following aggressive supportive care, her condition improved gradually. An elderly adult survived an intentional ingestion of 63 grams of metformin and developed no permanent sequelae. PEDIATRIC: Ingestions of up to 1700 mg of metformin were well tolerated in healthy children. A 15-year-old girl developed lactic acidosis and acute renal failure after ingesting 38.25 g (0.55 g\/kg body weight) of metformin. She recovered completely following supportive care. A 15-year-old girl developed lactic acidosis, hypotension, and recurrent and severe hypoglycemia, requiring boluses of 50% dextrose after ingesting 75 g of metformin and 3 g of quetiapine in a suicide attempt. She recovered following supportive care. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Immediate-release form: 1000 to 2550 mg orally daily in 2 to 3 divided doses; maximum: 2550 mg\/day.
