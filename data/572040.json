Other effects can include: nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, agitation, confusion, depression, bronchospasm, hyperthermia, chills, back or abdominal pain, leukocytosis, platelet activation, emboli, arterial occlusions, reperfusion dysrhythmias, cerebrovascular accidents, hypotension, hemopericardium, Guillain-Barre syndrome, renal dysfunction, hepatitis, and cutaneous or allergic reactions.<br\/>"},{"id":"572040-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>THROMBOLYTICS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Not required.<\/li><li>Support: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Hemorrhage: Give fresh frozen plasma and\/or cryoprecipitate, and packed RBCs for active bleeding.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: IV 0.9% NaCl, blood products if bleeding, dopamine, or norepinephrine.<\/li><li>Seizure: IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates.<\/li><li>Aminocaproic acid: Not documented as an antidote for streptokinase, but may be considered in an emergency.
