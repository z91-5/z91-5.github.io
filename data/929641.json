PHARMACOLOGY: Alpha-adrenergic blockers block peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptors and cause vasodilation. TOXICOLOGY: Excessive vasodilation causes hypotension and reflex tachycardia. Hypotension is generally not life-threatening. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures to alpha-adrenergic blockers are common. Mild to moderate symptoms occur occasionally, but severe hypotension is rare. Deaths are rare from single-substance ingestions. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness are common; syncope and mild sedation may develop. SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension, torsades de pointes, agitation, seizures, and priapism have been reported. Hypotension is generally not life-threatening. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Orthostasis and tachycardia have occurred with therapeutic use.<br\/><\/li><li><b>DUTASTERIDE <\/b><br\/>USES: Dutasteride is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PHARMACOLOGY: Dutasteride is a selective inhibitor of both the type 1 and type 2 isoforms of steroid 5-alpha-reductase. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: There are no reports of toxicity following acute overdose. In volunteer studies, single doses of up to 40 mg (80 times the therapeutic dose) for 7 days have been administered with no significant effects reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorders.

MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Hypotension that does not respond to IV fluids should be treated with adrenergic vasopressors such as phenylephrine or norepinephrine. Intubate patients with significant CNS depression. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines; add propofol or barbiturates if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital decontamination is NOT recommended because of the risk for seizures. HOSPITAL: Patients who are awake after a significant ingestion should be treated with activated charcoal to limit the potential for symptomatic hypotension. Gastric lavage is not indicated as overdose is rarely life-threatening.<\/li><li>Airway management: Airway management is not generally required for alpha adrenergic antagonists poisoning.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Priapism: Priapism may occur with these agents. An immediate urological consult is necessary. Clinical history should include the use of other agents (ie, antihypertensives, antidepressants, illegal agents) that may also be contributing to priapism. In a patient with ischemic priapism the corpora cavernosa are often completely rigid and the patient complains of pain, while nonischemic priapism the corpora are typically tumescent, but not completely rigid and pain is not typical. Aspirate blood from the corpus cavernosum with a fine needle. Blood gas testing of the aspirated blood may be used to distinguish ischemic (typically PO2 less than 30 mmHg, PCO2 greater than 60 mmHg, and pH less than 7.25) and nonischemic priapism. Color duplex ultrasonography may also be useful. If priapism persists after aspiration, inject a sympathomimetic. PHENYLEPHRINE: Dose: Adult: For intracavernous injection, dilute phenylephrine with normal saline for a concentration of 100 to 500 mcg\/mL and give 1 mL injections every 3 to 5 minutes for approximately 1 hour (before deciding that treatment is not successful). For children and patients with cardiovascular disease: Use lower concentrations in smaller volumes. NOTE: Treatment is less likely to be effective if done more than 48 hours after the development of priapism. Distal shunting (NOT first-line therapy) should only be considered after a trial of intracavernous injection of sympathomimetics.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Obtain an ECG and monitor renal function and serum electrolytes in hypotensive patients.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Dialysis is not likely to be useful as these agents are highly protein bound.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Unintentional ingestions by children of a single tablet or less can be observed at home; parents should be instructed to watch for dizziness or fainting. All symptomatic patients and those with self-harm ingestions should be sent to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients who have ingested an immediate-release formulation can be observed for 6 hours (observe at least 12 hours after overdose with a sustained-release formulation) and cleared if they have normal vital signs and mental status. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with persistent hypotension, seizures, or dysrhythmias should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance with patients with severe toxicity or if the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>DUTASTERIDE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Dutasteride has a low toxicity profile. Treatment of overdose is symptomatic and supportive.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Gastric decontamination is unlikely to be necessary unless a coingestant is involved. HOSPITAL: Gastric decontamination is unlikely to be necessary unless a coingestant is involved. If dutasteride exposure occurs in a woman who might be pregnant, activated charcoal should be administered as soon as possible to minimize potential exposure to the developing fetus.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: Mild to moderate allergic reactions may be treated with antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. Treatment of severe anaphylaxis also includes oxygen supplementation, aggressive airway management, epinephrine, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain a pregnancy test in any woman of child bearing potential who is exposed to dutasteride. Monitoring after overdose is based on symptoms observed, no other specific laboratory evaluation is indicated.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Due to large volume of distribution and high protein binding, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic children and adults with inadvertent overdose can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate overdose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstration toxicity should be hospitalized. CONSULT CRITERIA: If a pregnant woman is exposed to dutasteride, consultation with a toxicologist and neonatologist is recommended to assess the risk to the developing male fetus. Due to the long elimination half life of dutasteride (5 weeks), any woman exposed to it should avoid pregnancy because of the risk to the developing male fetus. Consultation with a toxicologist and neonatologist is advised to determine when attempting to become pregnant might be safe.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929641-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKERS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: Moderate toxicity generally occurs at 10 times the therapeutic dose.

ADULT: 60 mg caused hypotension, tachycardia and drowsiness in an adult. In another case, a 32-year-old woman, with chronic renal failure, epilepsy, and depression, developed hypotension and grand-mal seizures, resulting in death, after intentionally ingesting 60 mg doxazosin. INDORAMIN: ADULT: An overdose ingestion of 1500 mg resulted in seizures and torsade de pointes in an adult. PRAZOSIN: CHILD: up to 50 mg caused profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes in a 2-year-old. ADULT: 200 mg caused slight hypotension.
