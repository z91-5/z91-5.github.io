Risk factors for PML include therapy duration, prior immunosuppressant use, and presence of anti-JC virus antibodies. Because of the risk of PML, natalizumab is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the TOUCH(R) Prescribing Program. Monitor patients for any new sign or symptom that may be suggestive of PML and interrupt therapy at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML. For diagnosis, a gadolinium-enhanced MRI scan of the brain and, if indicated, cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC viral DNA are recommended.<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"928339-s-3","title":"Contraindications\/Warnings","sub":[{"id":"928339-s-3-9","title":"Contraindications","mono":"<ul><li>Hypersensitivity to natalizumab or any component of the product<\/li><li>History of or active progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928339-s-3-10","title":"Precautions","mono":"<ul><li>Black Box Warning:<\/li><li>-- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, potentially fatal, has been reported, with an increased risk with prolonged use, prior immunosuppressant use, and in anti-JC virus antibody positive patients; monitoring recommended and interrupt therapy at first sign or symptom<\/li><li>Hepatic:<\/li><li>-- Clinically significant hepatotoxicity, including acute liver failure requiring transplant, has been reported; discontinue use with laboratory or clinical evidence of liver injury<\/li><li>Immunologic:<\/li><li>-- Hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes serious (eg, anaphylaxis), have been reported, usually within 2 hours after starting infusion and with an increased risk in patients recommencing therapy after dose interruption or with persistent antibodies; permanently discontinue use if occurs<\/li><li>-- Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has been reported several days to weeks after plasma exchange in patients who discontinue therapy due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; monitoring recommended<\/li><li>-- Serious infections have been reported, especially with concomitant corticosteroids or immunosuppressants<\/li><li>-- Use not recommended in patients immunocompromised from existing systemic medical condition; increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or other serious infection<\/li><li>-- Do not perform anti-JC virus antibody testing for at least 2 weeks after plasma infusion due to removal of antibodies from serum<\/li><li>Neurologic:<\/li><li>-- Herpes encephalitis and meningitis, including fatalities, have been reported in multiple sclerosis patients; monitoring recommended and discontinue use if occurs<\/li><li>Concomitant use:<\/li><li>-- Concomitant use of antineoplastic, immunosuppressant, or immunomodulator therapy not recommended<\/li><li>-- Concomitant use of chronic corticosteroids in patients with Crohn disease; withdraw steroids as soon as therapeutic benefit occurs and discontinue natalizumab if systemic corticosteroid use continues beyond 6 months<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928339-s-3-11","title":"Pregnancy Category","mono":"<ul><li>C (FDA)<\/li><li>C (AUS)<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"928339-s-3-12","title":"Breast Feeding","mono":"Micromedex: Infant risk cannot be ruled out.<br\/>"}]},"5":{"id":"928339-s-5","title":"Adverse Effects","mono":"<b>Common<\/b><ul><li><b>Dermatologic:<\/b>Rash (multiple sclerosis, 12%; Crohn disease, 6%)<\/li><li><b>Gastrointestinal:<\/b>Abdominal discomfort (11%), Diarrhea (10%), Gastroenteritis (11%), Nausea (17%)<\/li><li><b>Musculoskeletal:<\/b>Arthralgia (multiple sclerosis, 19%; Crohn disease, 8%), Pain in limb (16%)<\/li><li><b>Neurologic:<\/b>Headache (32% to 38%)<\/li><li><b>Psychiatric:<\/b>Depression (19%)<\/li><li><b>Renal:<\/b>Urinary tract infectious disease (multiple sclerosis, 21%; Crohn disease, 3%)<\/li><li><b>Respiratory:<\/b>Lower respiratory tract infection (17%), Upper respiratory infection (22%)<\/li><li><b>Other:<\/b>Fatigue (multiple sclerosis, 27%; Crohn disease, 10%)<\/li><\/ul><b>Serious<\/b><ul><li><b>Gastrointestinal:<\/b>Adhesion of abdominal wall (0.3%), Appendicitis (0.8%), Bowel obstruction<\/li><li><b>Hematologic:<\/b>Anemia<\/li><li><b>Hepatic:<\/b>Cholelithiasis (0.3% to 1%), Hepatotoxicity<\/li><li><b>Immunologic:<\/b>Anaphylaxis (0.8%), Hypersensitivity reaction, Immune reconstitution syndrome<\/li><li><b>Neurologic:<\/b>Herpes virus infection of the central nervous system, Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (0.1% to 0.2%)<\/li><li><b>Psychiatric:<\/b>Suicidal thoughts (0.6%)<\/li><li><b>Respiratory:<\/b>Pneumonia (0.6%)<\/li><\/ul>"},"6":{"id":"928339-s-6","title":"Drug Name Info","sub":{"0":{"id":"928339-s-6-17","title":"US Trade Names","mono":"Tysabri<br\/>"},"2":{"id":"928339-s-6-19","title":"Class","mono":"<ul><li>Immune Suppressant<\/li><li>Monoclonal Antibody<\/li><\/ul>"},"3":{"id":"928339-s-6-20","title":"Regulatory Status","mono":"RX<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"928339-s-6-21","title":"Generic Availability","mono":"No<br\/>"}}},"7":{"id":"928339-s-7","title":"Mechanism Of Action","mono":"Natalizumab, a recombinant humanized IgG4-kappa monoclonal antibody, prevents transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium into the inflamed parenchymal tissue by binding to the alpha-4-subunit of alpha-4-beta-1 and alpha-4-beta-7 integrins on the surface of all leukocytes (except neutrophils) and inhibits the alpha 4-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to their counter-receptors. It blocks the molecular interaction of alpha 4 beta 1-integrin with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on activated vascular endothelial cells, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) on vascular endothelial gastrointestinal cells, and with connecting segment-1 (CS-1).
