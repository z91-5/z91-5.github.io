Ezetimibe localizes and appears to act at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in the clearance of cholesterol from the blood, this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"927021-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"0":{"id":"927021-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Variable bioavailability; food effects none <br\/>"},"2":{"id":"927021-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic and small intestine; Metabolites: Ezetimibe-glucuronide, ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide <br\/>"},"3":{"id":"927021-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: 69% unchanged; Renal: 9% metabolite    <br\/>"},"4":{"id":"927021-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 22 h<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"927021-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>may be taken with or without food<\/li><li>may be administered at the same time a concurrent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a statin) or fenofibrate is taken<\/li><li>take at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"927021-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>lipid panel<\/li><li>serum creatine kinase in patients experiencing muscle pain and those receiving other drugs associated with myopathy<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"927021-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Zetia<\/b><br\/>Oral Tablet: 10 MG<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"927021-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"927021-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>EZETIMIBE <\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited.
