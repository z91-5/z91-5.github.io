PHARMACOLOGY: Roflumilast and its active metabolite (roflumilast N-oxide) are selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide inhibition of PDE4 (a major cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic-AMP)-metabolizing enzyme in lung tissue) activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: During clinical studies, single doses of 2500 mcg and 5000 mcg produced an increased incidence of headache, gastrointestinal disorders, dizziness, palpitations, lightheadedness, clamminess and hypotension. SEVERE TOXICITY: Limited data. Symptomatic hypotension may develop. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Weight decrease, diarrhea, nausea, headache and back pain. LESS COMMON: Insomnia, dizziness and influenza. INFREQUENT: Anxiety, depression. RARE: Suicidal thoughts.<br\/>"},{"id":"929815-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>ROFLUMILAST<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids and vasopressors, if necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Serious toxicity is not expected after ingestion of roflumilast alone, and prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not routinely required. HOSPITAL: Significant toxicity is not expected after overdose; gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. Activated charcoal should be considered after extremely large ingestions or if more toxic coingestants are involved.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with serious toxicity or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Hypotensive episode: Initially treat with IV NS 10 to 20 ml\/kg, if unresponsive to fluid bolus administer dopamine, norepinephrine, as necessary.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and liver enzymes in all symptomatic patients. Assess neurologic status. Monitor fluid and electrolyte levels in patients with severe vomiting. Serum roflumilast levels are not readily available and are not clinically useful.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with a minor unintentional exposure who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms can likely be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with an inadvertent overdose who have more than mild symptoms and patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions should be sent to a health care facility for evaluation and treated until symptoms resolve. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate treatment should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or Poison Center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"929815-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>ROFLUMILAST<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been established.
