Liver injury is common, but is usually mild and evidenced only by abnormal liver enzymes. Overt liver disease can occur, however, and has been fatal in a few cases. Amiodarone can exacerbate the arrhythmia, e.g., by making the arrhythmia less well tolerated or more difficult to reverse. Patients with the indicated arrhythmias must be hospitalized while the loading dose is given, and a response generally requires at least one week, usually two or

PHARMACOLOGY: Amiodarone HCl is an antiarrhythmic drug with predominant class III effects of lengthening cardiac action potential and blocking myocardial potassium channels leading to slowed conduction and prolonged refractoriness. However, it also possesses electrophysiologic characteristics of all four Vaughan Williams classes. It rapidly blocks sodium channels like a class I drug, it applies antisympathetic action like a class II drug and has similar class IV negative inotropic effect in nodal tissue.  It also has antiadrenergic activity. TOXICOLOGY: Bradycardia may develop from beta adrenergic inhibition and prolongation of the refractory period. Prolongation of the action potential and refractory period can cause QTc prolongation. Toxicity in overdose is rare. The majority of toxic effects occurs during chronic use and include thyrotoxicosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatitis. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposures are uncommon and serious toxicity from acute ingestion has not been reported. Adverse drug effects are rare but may be life-threatening. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptoms can include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia. Rapid IV infusion may cause hypotension. SEVERE TOXICITY: Bradycardia, heart block, and hypotension developed in a neonate after IV overdose. In theory, torsades de pointes could develop after a large overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, malaise, fatigue, tremor, poor coordination and gait, and peripheral neuropathy, hypotension (with IV form). LESS FREQUENT: Constipation, anorexia, photosensitivity, dizziness, paresthesia, visual disturbances, elevated liver enzymes, pulmonary inflammation or fibrosis. RARE: Rash, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, prolonged QT, torsades de pointes, dysrhythmias, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hyponatremia, headache, acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, noninfectious epididymitis, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, blindness, corneal degeneration, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, acute hepatitis, anaphylaxis, SIADH, myopathy, dyskinesia, myoclonic jerks, and extrapyramidal hypertony. <br\/>"},{"id":"jsds12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AMIODARONE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Antiemetic medications and IV fluids can be used for gastrointestinal distress. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe toxicity is not expected. If symptomatic bradycardia occurs, administer atropine; if unresponsive, use beta adrenergic agonists (eg, isoproterenol). Consider temporary pacemaker insertion. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. Treat patients with torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate; correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary. HOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal in patients with large recent ingestions if the patient is alert and can protect the airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, pulmonary toxicity, or severe allergic reaction.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Serum amiodarone concentrations are not rapidly available or useful for guiding therapy, although they may confirm exposure.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with deliberate ingestion, significant ingestion, or patients with comorbidities or symptoms, should be referred to a healthcare facility for observation. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain persistently symptomatic despite supportive management should be admitted for further observation.
