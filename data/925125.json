When administered intrathecally, this agent diffuses to the basal, sylvian, and cerebral cisterns and subarachnoid space around the convexity of the brain; it is then absorbed via the subarachnoid granulations into the bloodstream. Since this transit can be followed by means of external imaging, any deviations from the normal pattern can be detected. Significant abnormalities may be manifest as delayed or non-appearance of the agent in the subarachnoid space around the convexity of the brain or as reflux of the agent into the cerebral ventricles. The site of CSF leakage may be identified by an abnormal collection of activity. When  111In-DTPA is used to test the patency of  CSF shunts (e.g., ventriculoperitoneal), absent or markedly diminished accumulation in and transit through the shunt tubing is an indication of obstruction.  <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"925125-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"3":{"id":"925125-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Renal: 65%<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"925125-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intrathecal<\/b><br\/><ul><li>maintain adequate shielding of the product at all times<\/li><li>use care to minimize radiation exposure to patient and personnel<\/li><li>exercise extreme caution during intrathecal injection to assure aseptic conditions<\/li><li>may discard residual materials in ordinary trash if vials\/syringes read no greater than background with an appropriate low-range survey meter<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"925125-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>radiographic visualization of the subarachnoid spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid is indicative of efficacy<\/li><li>renal function tests in the elderly<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"925125-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Intrathecal Solution: 1 MCI\/ML<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"925125-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"This drug may cause skin reactions or vomiting, and in rare instances, aseptic meningitis and pyrogenic reactions. <br\/>"}}}
