Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were at a greater risk for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target Hb levels of greater than 11 g\/dL in clinical studies. No trial has identified a Hb target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. In CKD patients, use the lowest sufficient dose to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. In cancer patients with certain tumor types (ie, breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, cervical), ESAs shortened overall survival and increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies. In cancer patients, use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions to reduce these risks and the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions. Use ESAs only for treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course.
