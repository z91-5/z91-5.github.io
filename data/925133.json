It accumulates preferentially in neovasculature, including choroidal neovasculature. Activation of verteporfin by nonthermal light (689 nanometers wavelength) in the presence of oxygen generates highly reactive, short-lived singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals. The activated particles cause local damage to neovascular endothelium and subsequent vessel occlusion. Damaged endothelium releases procoagulant and vasoactive factors causing platelet aggregation, fibrin clot formation, and vasoconstriction. These factors contribute to the temporary occlusion of choroidal neovascularization.<\/li><li>Animal models indicate verteporfin is also present in the retina. Therefore, collateral damage may be caused to retinal structures following photoactivation in humans, including the retinal pigmented epithelium and outer nuclear layer of the retina.<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"925133-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"2":{"id":"925133-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Parenteral-Local: Hepatic and plasma esterases<br\/>"},"3":{"id":"925133-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Parenteral-Local: Fecal: primarily; Renal: &lt; 0.01% route<br\/>"},"4":{"id":"925133-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Parenteral-Local:  5 to 6 h<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"925133-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/><ul><li>use rubber gloves and wear eye protection to avoid contact with the skin and eyes during preparation and administration; any exposed person must be protected from bright light<\/li><li>wipe spills up with a damp cloth; use rubber gloves and eye protection for spills and disposal<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>establish free-flowing IV line, use largest arm vein possible; avoid small veins in back of the hand; avoid extravasation<\/li><li>reconstitute 15-mg vial with 7 mL sterile water for injection for a total concentration of 2 mg\/mL; protect from light; use within 4 hours<\/li><li>withdraw appropriate dose and further dilute with D5W to total volume of 30 mL<\/li><li>infuse over 10 minutes at a rate of 3 mL\/min; use an appropriate syringe pump and a 1.2-micron in-line filter<\/li><li>light administration should be initiated 15 minutes after the start of the 10-minute infusion<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"925133-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>ophthalmologic exam (eg; every 3 months)<\/li><li>extravasation<\/li><li>ECG, blood pressure, hepatic function, CBC<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"925133-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Visudyne<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 15 MG<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"925133-s-12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"925133-s-12-31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>VERTEPORFIN<\/b><br\/>OVERDOSE: Overdose information is limited.
