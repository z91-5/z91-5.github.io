As of November 5, 2007, the manufacturer suspended the marketing of aprotinin due to preliminary reports from a Canadian study suggesting an increased risk of death with the use of aprotinin as compared with two other antifibrinolytic drugs used in the study. PHARMACOLOGY: As an antifibrinolytic and protease inhibitor, aprotinin attenuates inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombin generation, modulating the systemic inflammatory response associated with cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, resulting in decreased bleeding and a reduced need for allogeneic blood transfusions. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdoses are rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Doses up to 17.5 million Kallikrein Inhibitor Units (KIU), administered within a 24-hour period, have been well-tolerated with no apparent toxicity. SEVERE TOXICITY: Coronary and pulmonary thromboses are major adverse events that could potentially occur following severe overdose.  Hepatic and renal failure, resulting in death, was reported in a patient postoperatively who received greater than 15 million KIU aprotinin in a 24-hour period. The patient had pre-existing hepatic dysfunction. An autopsy indicated hepatic necrosis and extensive renal tubular and glomerular necrosis; however, causality was unclear. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, renal dysfunction, anaphylaxis, coronary and pulmonary thromboses, and death have been reported with aprotinin therapy.<br\/>"},{"id":"930687-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>APROTININ<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Hypotension is a frequently reported sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. Treat mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In patients with acute allergic reaction, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors and epinephrine may be required.  Look for clinical evidence of thromboembolic complications (eg, chest pain, shortness of breath, flank pain, extremity pain) and obtain specific studies (eg, CT, angiography) to evaluate for thromboembolic complications as needed.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended; administered via the parenteral route.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with severe allergic reactions or pulmonary toxicity.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Acute allergic reaction: MILD\/MODERATE: Antihistamines with or without inhaled beta agonists, corticosteroids or epinephrine. SEVERE: Oxygen, aggressive airway management, antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids, ECG monitoring, and IV fluids.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain a CBC with differential, PT or INR, and PTT following a significant exposure or in symptomatic patients. Monitor for evidence of anaphylaxis. Monitor renal function and vital signs. Look for clinical evidence of thromboembolic complications (eg; chest pain, shortness of breath, flank pain, extremity pain). Specific studies (eg; CT, angiography) may be needed to evaluate for thromboembolic complications.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Any patient with symptoms should be observed with frequent monitoring of vital signs. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged.
