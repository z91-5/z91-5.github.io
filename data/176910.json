The iodine content of a contrast media is the most important factor, since this component is responsible for the absorption of radiation and the degree of opacification.  The high atomic weight of iodine contributes sufficient x-radiation attenuation to impart radiographic contrast with surrounding tissue.  Diagnostic radiopaque agents have few known pharmacological effects.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"176910-s-8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"176910-s-8-23","title":"Absorption","mono":"<ul><li>Oral: minimal<\/li><li>Rectal: minimal<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"176910-s-8-24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Protein binding: 0% to 10% bound to serum albumin <br\/>"},{"id":"176910-s-8-25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"not metabolized <br\/>"},{"id":"176910-s-8-26","title":"Excretion","mono":"<ul><li>Fecal: (intravenous), less than 2%<\/li><li>Renal: (intravenous), 12% within 10 minutes, 38% at 60 minutes, 45% at 3 hours, and 94% to 100% at 24 hours excreted unchanged<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"176910-s-8-27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Adults: (intravenous), 120 min <br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"176910-s-9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>do NOT administer by intrathecal route<\/li><li>solution should be at body temperature when injected; may need to be warmed<\/li><li>if crystallization occurs, place the vial in a water bath at 40 to 50 degrees C and shake it gently for 2 to 3 minutes or until solids redissolve; discard the vial if particles still persist<\/li><li>solution may be autoclaved once<\/li><li>do not contaminate catheters, syringes, needles, and contrast media with glove powder or cotton fibers<\/li><li>discard any unused portion<\/li><li>(angiography), flush the catheter frequently with heparinized saline solutions; use plastic syringes in place of glass to decrease the likelihood of in vitro clotting.<\/li><li>(cervical discography), use 2-needle technique to avoid the rupture of the disk<\/li><li>(operative and T-tube cholangiography), inject the agent very slowly to prevent extravasation.<\/li><li>(percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography), aspirate as much of the contrast agent as possible after the procedure to reduce to potential of bile leakage and peritonitis<\/li><li>(splenoportography), avoid manipulations which would prolong the time the needle is in the spleen to avoid subcapsular extravasation of agent and bleeding<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"176910-s-10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>image quality and diagnostic usefulness<\/li><li>vital signs; baseline and then periodically<\/li><li>ECG; baseline and then periodically as clinically indicated<\/li><li>injection site reactions; frequently for any signs of extravasation<\/li><li>renal and hepatic function; baseline and then periodically as clinically indicated<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of iodine or other contrast agents sensitivity; during procedure and then for 30 to 60 minutes after the procedure<\/li><li>signs and symptoms of thrombosis; especially when percutaneous techniques are employed<\/li><li>thyroid function tests (T3 resin uptake and total or free thyroxine (T4) assays); at baseline and after procedure as clinically indicated<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"176910-s-11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Gastrografin<\/b><br\/>Oral Solution: (Diatrizoate Meglumine - Diatrizoate Sodium) 66 %-10 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>MD-Gastroview<\/b><br\/>Oral Solution: (Diatrizoate Meglumine - Diatrizoate Sodium) 66 %-10 %<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"176910-s-13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Patient should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination until drug effects are realized, as drug may cause dizziness.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to rise slowly from a sitting\/supine position, as drug may cause hypotension.<\/li><li>The injection form of this drug may cause vasodilation, fever, chills, paresthesia, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, cough, and rash.<\/li><li>The oral form of this drug may cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, rash, itching, and headache.<\/li><li>Advise patient to report signs\/symptoms of thyroid storm (chest pain, tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, anxiety).<\/li><li>Instruct patients to be fully hydrated before procedures (with the possible exception of urography).<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
