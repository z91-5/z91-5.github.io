Dipyridamole&quot;s mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated , but may involve its ability to increase endogenous concentrations of adenosine , which is a coronary vasodilator   and a platelet aggregation inhibitor , and of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) , which decreases platelet activation . Dipyridamole may increase concentrations of adenosine by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme adenosine deaminase, thereby decreasing adenosine metabolism, and by inhibiting adenosine uptake   by erythrocytes   and vascular endothelial cells . Adenosine stimulates adenylate cyclase activity, leading to increased cAMP synthesis   and consequently to reduced platelet function . Also, dipyridamole may raise the intraplatelet cAMP concentration by increasing prostacyclin-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity , which increases cAMP synthesis , and by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase , which decreases cAMP breakdown . Additionally, dipyridamole may inhibit the formation of thromboxane A 2, which is a potent stimulator of platelet activation .<\/li><li>Dipyridamole does not affect prothrombin time when administered concurrently with coumarin- or indanedione-derivative anticoagulants .<\/li><li>Thromboembolism prophylaxis adjunct-Dipyridamole may act by inhibiting platelet aggregation , although studies of the medication&quot;s ability to reduce platelet function after oral administration of usual doses have yielded conflicting results .  In vitro, high concentrations of dipyridamole are required to inhibit platelet function ; the necessary concentrations may not be achieved  in vivo with recommended doses . There is some evidence that the medication may be more effective in preventing platelet deposition on artificial surfaces (e.g., synthetic prosthetic heart valves) than on natural surfaces . Dipyridamole also restores toward normal the shortened platelet survival time that occurs in patients with thrombosis , prosthetic heart valves , vascular grafts , or vascular abnormalities . However, the relevance of this action to any antithrombotic effect of dipyridamole has not been established .<\/li><li>Diagnostic aid adjunct (ischemic heart disease)-Dipyridamole may preferentially dilate, and increase blood flow through, nondiseased coronary blood vessels , leading to a redistribution of blood flow away from significantly stenotic coronary vessels . This \"coronary steal\" effect increases the differential in perfusion, and consequently in radiopharmaceutical uptake, between regions of the myocardium supplied by normal coronary arteries and those supplied by stenotic vessels .

It is also used as an alternative to exercise with thallium myocardial perfusion imaging to detect coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole is also available in combination with aspirin. Refer to \"SALICYLATES\" management for information on aspirin overdose. PHARMACOLOGY: Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes resulting in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine. By acting on the platelet A(2)-receptor, the increase in concentration of adenosine stimulates platelet adenylate cyclase and in turn increases the levels of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which inhibits platelet aggregation. TOXICOLOGY: Inhibition of adenosine uptake in arterial endothelial cells causes vasodilation and hypotension. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Overdose data are limited. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects following therapeutic doses.  Dizziness, warm feeling, flushing, sweating, restlessness, weakness, dizziness, hypotension, and tachycardia may occur with overdose. SEVERE TOXICITY: SEVERE TOXICITY: A woman with long-standing angina developed myocardial infarction after ingesting approximately 5 g of dipyridamole tablets. Loss of consciousness, hypotension, deep ST depression and T wave inversion, elevated PT and PTT, and respiratory arrest developed in another woman after dipyridamole overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (greater than 11%): Angina pectoris, ECG changes (mostly ST-T changes), headache, and dizziness. OTHER EFFECTS: Hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distress, diarrhea, flushing, tachycardia, hypersensitivity reactions, and dyspnea. RARE: Thrombocytopenia, seizures, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, stroke, and transient cerebral ischemia may occur. <br\/>"},{"id":"3xtas12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DIPYRIDAMOLE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. Dipyridamole is also available in combination with aspirin. Refer to &quot;SALICYLATES&quot; management for information on aspirin overdose. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat severe hypotension with IV 0.9% NaCl at 10 to 20 mL\/kg. Add dopamine or norepinephrine if unresponsive to fluids. Consider using a xanthine derivative (eg, aminophylline 50 to 240 mg) to reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole overdose. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression or persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL:  Consider activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, CNS depression, hemodynamic instability, or severe allergic reactions.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment. Patients should be observed for 6 hours with frequent monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment should be admitted. Patients with unstable vital signs and\/or life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias should be admitted to an intensive care unit.

ADULTS: Doses of up to 2000 mg\/day have been used therapeutically.  Acute ingestions of 200 to 1250 mg have produced toxicity. A woman with long-standing angina had a non-ST elevation developed myocardial infarction after ingesting approximately 5 g of dipyridamole tablets.  Loss of consciousness, hypotension, deep ST depression and T wave inversion, elevated PT and PTT, and respiratory arrest developed in a woman after ingesting 1.75 g of dipyridamole. THERAPEUTIC DOSES: ADULTS: Thallium myocardial perfusion: 0.142 mg\/kg\/min (0.57 mg\/kg total) as an IV infusion over 4 minutes prior to thallium; a total dose in excess of 60 mg will most likely not be necessary. Thrombosis prophylaxis, heart valve replacement: 75 to 100 mg orally 4 times daily as an adjunct to warfarin therapy. Stroke prevention: One capsule of extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg\/aspirin 25 mg orally twice daily. CHILDREN: Safety and effectiveness of dipyridamole have not been established in pediatric patients. Oral doses of 1 to 4.2 mg\/kg\/day have been used in children with platelet dysfunction and cardiac valve replacement.
