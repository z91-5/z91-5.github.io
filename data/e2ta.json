These cause preferential inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, inhibition of virus-induced ribonucleotide reductase, or inhibition of other virus-specific enzymes involved in DNA synthesis that are more sensitive to inhibition than the corresponding host cell enzymes. This inhibition prevents lengthening of the DNA chain.
