Currently, doxapram is the only analeptic available in the US; however, other analeptic agents that may still be used in other countries include nikethamide, pentylenetetrazol, and bemegride. Historically, these medications have been used to increase minute ventilation and decrease CNS depression. They have also been used for cardiovascular stimulant effects, to induce seizures during EEG monitoring, and for behavioral control in geriatric patients. Doxapram was also used to treat pediatric apnea. Currently, these medications are not commonly used and are not typically recommended for these conditions. Methylphenidate and amphetamine are covered in separate managements. PHARMACOLOGY: Analeptics cause increased pulmonary ventilation by increasing the depth and rate of respiration; they may act by directly stimulating the respiratory center in the medulla or indirectly affecting the carotid body. TOXICOLOGY: Analeptic toxicity is typically an extension of the therapeutic effects due to overstimulation of the CNS, overstimulation of the respiratory drive, and overstimulation of the cardiovascular system. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Analeptic use and overdose are extremely rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose data are limited. It is anticipated that overdose effects may be an extension of events reported with therapeutic use. Early signs of overdose may be excessive pressor effects, such as hypertension, tachycardia, skeletal muscle hyperactivity, and enhanced deep tendon reflexes. Nausea, agitation, confusion, sweating, cough, dyspnea, seizures may also occur. ADVERSE EFFECTS: The following adverse effects have been reported following therapeutic doses of doxapram: Nausea, vomiting, flushing, sweating, pruritus, paresthesia, diarrhea, urinary retention, elevation of BUN, albuminuria, pyrexia, apprehension, disorientation, pupillary dilatation, hallucinations, headache, dizziness, hyperactivity, involuntary movements, muscle spasticity, muscle fasciculations, increases deep tendon reflexes, clonus, seizures, dyspnea, cough, hyperventilation, tachypnea, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, rebound hypoventilation, phlebitis, variations in heart rate, dysrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), chest pain, mild to moderate hypertension, hemolysis with rapid infusion, a decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count. Rarely, analeptics may precipitate an attack of acute porphyria, and may be associated with worsened leukopenia and anemia in patients with preexisting leukopenia or anemia.<br\/><\/li><li><b>CAFFEINE <\/b><br\/>USES: Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is present in coffee, tea, colas, and chocolate. It is also utilized in over-the-counter cough and cold therapies, and in many dietary supplement products used as anorexiants, diuretics, and stimulants. Botanical sources of caffeine include guarana, yerba mate, and kola nuts. Caffeine is used medicinally for neonatal apnea and postlumbar puncture headache. PHARMACOLOGY: Caffeine is a trimethylxanthine closely related to theophylline. It acts through nonselective inhibition of adenosine receptors and phosphodiesterase. There is also beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic stimulation secondary to catecholamine release. TOXICOLOGY: Caffeine is an adenosine analog and functions primarily as an adenosine antagonist lowering the seizure threshold. It also inhibits phosphodiesterase, resulting in accumulation of cAMP and calcium, causing organ-specific downstream effects such as smooth muscle relaxation, or muscle\/cardiac\/CNS excitation. Caffeine overdoses result in surges in circulating catecholamines and rennin, as well as increased levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in the brain. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Caffeine is commonly used; however, severe manifestations of toxicity are rare, and most exposures result in mild toxicity. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: The earliest symptoms of acute caffeine poisoning include anorexia, tremor, and restlessness, followed by nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia. Chronic high-dose caffeine intake can lead to &quot;caffeinism,&quot; which includes nervousness, twitching, anxiety, tremulousness, insomnia, palpitations, and hyperreflexia. SEVERE TOXICITY: With serious ingestions, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, confusion, seizures, tachycardia, and nonfatal dysrhythmias may occur.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"97990-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANALEPTICS<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment of mild to moderate toxicity consists of predominantly symptomatic and supportive care. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Patients with severe toxicity may require benzodiazepines or barbiturates for control of agitation or seizures or treatment of rigidity. Treat hyperthermia with benzodiazepines to control agitation and rigidity and external cooling measures. Tachycardia and hypertension generally respond to benzodiazepine sedation. Rarely, patients may require intubation for pulmonary edema.<\/li><li>Decontamination: Acute toxicity is extremely rare as these agents are rarely used. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not necessary. Activated charcoal is not recommended due to the risk of seizures and associated aspiration.<\/li><li>Airway management: Patients who develop seizures, pulmonary edema, or respiratory depression may require intubation for airway management.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor vital signs and mental status. Serum concentrations of these agents are not widely available or useful to guide therapy. Monitor serum electrolytes and creatine kinase in patients with seizures, rigidity, or hyperthermia. All patients with suspected analeptic toxicity should have an ECG. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with significant tachycardia or an abnormal ECG.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis has not been studied and is unlikely to be of benefit following analeptic toxicity or overdose.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients should be observed for 6 hours after exposure. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who develop severe signs and symptoms of analeptic toxicity such as seizures, heart block, marked tachycardia, pulmonary edema, or severe hypertension should be admitted to the hospital. Any patient with recurrent seizures, status epilepticus, recurrent dysrhythmias, or requiring intubation should be admitted to an ICU. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for any patient with suspected significant analeptic toxicity.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>CAFFEINE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Mild to moderate exposures usually respond to fluid repletion and antiemetic therapy. Electrolyte replacement should be performed as indicated. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: There is potential for seizures, vomiting, and dysrhythmias, so consider early airway management. Monitor ECG and vital signs for at least 6 hours after any concerning oral ingestion. Treat agitation and seizures with benzodiazepines. If unsuccessful, phenobarbital or propofol may be utilized. Follow patients for hyperthermia or rhabdomyolysis. Treat hypotension with IV fluid boluses and vasopressin or phenylephrine if hypotension persists; drugs with significant beta-adrenergic effects should be avoided. Hypokalemia usually resolves without aggressive treatment because it is due to an intracellular shift of potassium ions; however, severe hypokalemia should be treated. Beta-blockers effectively reverse cardiotoxic effects mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation. Treat severe tachyarrhythmias with hypotension not responsive to fluid boluses or pressors with esmolol 50 to 200 mcg\/kg\/min beginning with low doses and titrating to effect. Follow advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and pediatric advanced life support (PALS) guidelines for malignant dysrhythmias.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PRE-HOSPITAL: Decontamination should be avoided. Mild exposures do not require treatment, and severe overdose can result in seizures and aspiration. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal adsorbs caffeine effectively. Administration of activated charcoal should be considered on an individual basis; it should be reserved for patients with the potential for significant toxicity and a recent ingestion who are alert or in whom the airway is protected. Gastric lavage is rarely utilized, but might be considered in the rare patient with a recent, life threatening ingestion.<\/li><li>Airway management: As seizures and vomiting are common after severe overdose, it is important to manage the airway early.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no antidote for caffeine.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No studies are needed in patients with minimal symptoms. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms should have electrolytes checked, and if there is any concern for rhabdomyolysis, a CPK should be checked. An ECG should be performed with continuous cardiac monitoring in moderate to severe poisoning. Caffeine levels are obtainable, but not routinely available in general hospital laboratories and not useful to guide therapy. Serum concentrations greater than 80 mg\/L have been associated with mortality.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is effective and indicated in patients with severe toxicity (eg, seizures, ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension).<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Patients with nontoxic ingestions with minimal symptoms can be managed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Intentional self-harm attempts should be referred to a health care facility. Observe all patients with mild symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations) until resolution of symptoms. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with moderate symptoms including palpitations and mild electrolyte disturbances can be observed on telemetry. Any patient showing signs of severe toxicity (ie, seizures, ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension) should be admitted to the ICU. CONSULT CRITERIA: Involve a poison center or toxicologist with any questions, concerns, or cases of moderate to severe toxicity. If you are considering dialysis, a nephrologist should be involved.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"97990-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>ANALEPTICS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A preterm infant (born at 28 weeks gestation) inadvertently received a doxapram infusion of 9.5 mg\/kg\/hour, instead of 0.95 mg\/kg\/hour, for approximately 4.5 hours (total dose 72.9 mg), and only experienced nausea and increased gastric residuals as a result.
