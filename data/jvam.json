DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5alpha-reductase, which exists as 2 isoforms, type 1 and type 2. Type 2 isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissue while type 1 isoenzyme is responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver. Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5alpha-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. <br\/>"},"8":{"id":"jvams8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":[{"id":"jvams8b23","title":"Absorption","mono":"Systemic: Bioavailability: 60% <br\/>"},{"id":"jvams8b24","title":"Distribution","mono":"Systemic: Vd: 300 to 500 L <br\/>"},{"id":"jvams8b25","title":"Metabolism","mono":"Systemic: Hepatic: extensively via CYP3A4 pathway; Major metabolites: 4'-hydroxydutasteride, 1,2-dihydrodutasteride, and 6-hydroxydutasteride;  Minor metabolites: 6,4'-dihydroxydutasteride and 15-hydroxydutasteride <br\/>"},{"id":"jvams8b26","title":"Excretion","mono":"Systemic: Fecal: 40%, 5% unchanged; Renal: &lt;1% <br\/>"},{"id":"jvams8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 5 wk <br\/>"}]},"9":{"id":"jvams9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Oral<\/b><br\/><ul><li>take with or without food<\/li><li>swallow capsules whole; do not chew or open<\/li><li>women should not handle capsules when they are pregnant or may potentially become pregnant due of the possibility of absorption and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus<\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"jvams10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>prostate-specific antigen (PSA); expected to decrease by approximately 50% following 3 to 6 months of treatment<\/li><li>improvement in the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (eg, decrease in residual urinary volume and increased urinary flow) indicates efficacy<\/li><li>for interpretation of serial PSA, establish a new baseline after at least 3 months of treatment and monitor periodically thereafter; use the new value to evaluate potential cancer-related changes to PSA<\/li><li>for interpretation of an isolated PSA value in a man taking dutasteride for 3 months or more, double the PSA value for comparison with normal values in untreated men; any increase from nadir should be evaluated (even if the values are within normal range for men not taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors)<\/li><li>detection of prostate cancer using the free-to-total prostate specific ratio (percent free PSA), no adjustment to the PSA value is necessary (value remains constant during therapy)<\/li><li>rule out prostate cancer and other urological diseases prior to initiating therapy and periodically thereafter<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"jvams11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Avodart<\/b><br\/>Oral Capsule, Liquid Filled: 0.5 MG<br\/>"},"12":{"id":"jvams12","title":"Toxicology","sub":[{"id":"jvams12b31","title":"Clinical Effects","mono":"<b>DUTASTERIDE <\/b><br\/>USES: Dutasteride is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PHARMACOLOGY: Dutasteride is a selective inhibitor of both the type 1 and type 2 isoforms of steroid 5-alpha-reductase. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY: There are no reports of toxicity following acute overdose. In volunteer studies, single doses of up to 40 mg (80 times the therapeutic dose) for 7 days have been administered with no significant effects reported. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorders.

OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate overdose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstration toxicity should be hospitalized. CONSULT CRITERIA: If a pregnant woman is exposed to dutasteride, consultation with a toxicologist and neonatologist is recommended to assess the risk to the developing male fetus. Due to the long elimination half life of dutasteride (5 weeks), any woman exposed to it should avoid pregnancy because of the risk to the developing male fetus.
