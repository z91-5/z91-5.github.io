Also used topically to treat or prevent skin infections and as eye drops or ointment for bacterial conjunctivitis. PHARMACOLOGY: Aminoglycosides function by binding the aminoacyl site of 16S ribosomal RNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit. This binding results in the misreading of genetic code, inhibition of translocation, and bacterial cell death. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Given that aminoglycosides (with the exception of neomycin) are only available in parenteral, topical, and ophthalmic forms, overdoses are almost entirely the result of dosing errors. Overdoses are rarely life-threatening and typically require minimal intervention. Ingestions of ophthalmic or topical preparations do not cause toxicity related to the aminoglycoside. Although neomycin is available orally, oral absorption is low and acute toxicity from overdosage is unlikely. OVERDOSE: Toxicity is more closely associated with trough levels of the drug than peak levels. Renal damage (acute tubular necrosis; usually reversible), ototoxicity (irreversible), and vestibular toxicity (irreversible) are most common. Renal injury may often go unnoticed until significant injury has occurred, given the delay between when renal injury occurs and when the elevation in creatinine is evident. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Retinopathy and visual loss with intraocular administration. Apnea and neuromuscular blockade may occur when aminoglycosides are given rapidly IV with neuromuscular blocking agents, due to aminoglycosides' inhibition of acetylcholine release from presynaptic nerve terminals; patients with abnormal neuromuscular junction function (eg, myasthenia gravis, botulism) can develop respiratory failure or weakness after use of aminoglycosides alone. Rash and hypersensitivity reactions can occur.<br\/>"},{"id":"616040-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>AMINOGLYCOSIDES<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

Inadvertent ingestion of ophthalmic, otic or topical preparations can be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with significant overdose should have renal function monitoring and auditory testing performed.
