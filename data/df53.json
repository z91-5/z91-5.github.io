It inhibits thymidylic phosphorylase and specific DNA polymerases, which are necessary for the incorporation of thymidine into viral DNA. Trifluridine is incorporated in place of thymidine into viral DNA, resulting in faulty DNA and the inability to reproduce or to infect or destroy tissue. Trifluridine also is incorporated into mammalian DNA.<br\/>"},"8":{"id":"df53s8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"4":{"id":"df53s8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Ophthalmic: 12 to 18 min<br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"df53s9","title":"Administration","mono":"<b>Ophthalmic<\/b><br\/>store refrigerated at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) <br\/>"},"10":{"id":"df53s10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"<ul><li>symptomatic improvement<\/li><li>ophthalmic examinations<\/li><\/ul>"},"11":{"id":"df53s11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<ul><li><b>Generic<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 1 %<br\/><\/li><li><b>Viroptic<\/b><br\/>Ophthalmic Solution: 1 %<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},"13":{"id":"df53s13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>This drug may cause eyelid edema and burning sensation in the eye.<\/li><li>Advise patient to tell healthcare professional if no improvement seen after 7 days of therapy.<\/li><li>Instruct patient on proper instillation technique.<\/li><li>Patient should not exceed 21 days of continuous administration.<\/li><\/ul>"}}}
