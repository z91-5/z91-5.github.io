It is indicated to control an outbreak of gram-positive infection where other infection control measures have failed. PHARMACOLOGY: Hexachlorophene is a bacteriostatic agent against staphylococci and other gram positive bacteria. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: DERMAL: Dermal application of highly concentrated (greater than 3%) preparations on several occasions or repeated applications of less concentrated preparations, especially in neonates or to damaged skin, may result in significant toxicity. Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and lethargy frequently occur as early signs of toxicity. In one study, an erythematous desquamative rash was the most common sign of topical hexachlorophene toxicity (reported in 93% of 204 children dermally exposed to 6.3% hexachlorophene powder). The rash may precede or follow the onset of neurologic abnormalities. In patients with significant CNS toxicity (eg, coma, seizures), cerebral edema is almost always present, sometimes sufficient to cause herniation and death. INGESTION: Acute ingestion of large amounts (greater than 30 mL by adults) or repeated ingestion of small amounts may cause significant toxicity or death.  Anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dehydration, seizures, hypotension, shock, and death have been reported following accidental ingestion of 1 to 4 oz (30 to 120 mL) of 3% hexachlorophene. Other reported effects include bradycardia, blindness, muscular fasciculations, irritability, weakness, hypertonicity, transverse myelopathy of the spinal cord, cranial nerve palsies, choreoathetosis, and cardiorespiratory arrest. <br\/>"},{"id":"5zihs12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>HEXACHLOROPHENE <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. Where elevated intracranial pressure or cerebral edema are present, treatment should be initiated.  Controlled hyperventilation, osmotic diuretics and\/or dexamethasone may prove to be useful. Based on hexachlorophene's lipid solubility, intravenous lipid infusion might be useful in the treatment of patients with severe toxicity, but there are no published reports of its use.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL:  Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression or seizures and subsequent aspiration. DERMAL: Vigorous washing with soap and water is necessary. Hexachlorophene is well absorbed dermally and may remain on the skin following simple rinsing due to poor solubility in water. HOSPITAL:  Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with significant CNS depression or persistent seizures.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Plasma concentrations are not readily available or clinically useful in the management of overdose. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is probably not effective due to rapid redistribution of hexachlorophene into body lipid stores.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic patients with limited dermal exposure can probably be managed at home. Asymptomatic patients with inadvertent ingestion of a lick or taste can also be managed at home. Acute ingestion of large amounts (greater than 30 mL by adults, more than a lick or taste by children) or repeated ingestion of small amounts may cause significant toxicity or death. These patients should be referred to a healthcare facility. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate overdose, and those who are symptomatic, should be evaluated in a health care facility. Patients that remain asymptomatic can be discharged. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients should be admitted for severe vomiting, profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, significant CNS depression, or persistent seizures. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is not clear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"5zihs12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>HEXACHLOROPHENE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The minimal toxic or lethal dose following acute ingestion or repeated skin application is not well defined.
