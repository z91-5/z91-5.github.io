Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24, and there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Monitor patients closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, unusual changes in behavior; families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber.

Off-label indications include ADHD and bipolar disorder. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Unintentional and deliberate poisonings are relatively common and may occasionally be severe. Fatalities are rare. PHARMACOLOGY: Selective neuronal reuptake inhibitor of dopamine &gt; norepinephrine &gt;&gt; serotonin. TOXICOLOGY: Primarily sympathomimetic activity. Also possesses peripheral alpha(1)-adrenergic agonism. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Tachycardia and mild hypertension are common. Seizures are also fairly common, but usually are self-limited, single seizures. Neurologic disturbances such as agitation, dizziness, tremor, paresthesias, slurred speech, lethargy, confusion, and hallucinations (auditory, visual, or tactile) are fairly common, and often precede the development of seizures. Vomiting develops in a minority of patients. SEVERE TOXICITY: buPROPion may cause recurrent seizures or status epilepticus, hyperthermia, hypotension, and coma. Rarely QRS widening. QTc prolongation (conduction delays), and ventricular dysrhythmias may develop, especially with very large (greater than 9 g) ingestions. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Dry mouth, headache, insomnia, nausea, and weight loss. Other symptoms that may occur in 5% to 10% of individuals: abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, tinnitus, memory deficits, paresthesiae, agitation, anxiety, seizures, infection, pharyngitis, palpitation, and sweating.<br\/><\/li><li><b>OPIOID ANTAGONISTS, LONG ACTING <\/b><br\/>USES: Long acting opioid antagonists (methylnaltrexone, nalmefene, and naltrexone) blunt or reverse the effects of opioid medications. Their indications include reversal of life-threatening respiratory depression secondary to stimulation of opioid receptors (nalmefene), treatment of alcohol dependence (naltrexone), and reversal of opioid-induced constipation (methylnaltrexone). Naltrexone is also used to treat chronic opioid dependence once detoxification is complete. Nalmefene hydrochloride injection was discontinued from the market in 2008. PHARMACOLOGY: Long acting opioid antagonists compete and displace narcotics at opioid receptor sites. TOXICOLOGY: Secondary to its antagonists effects at opioid receptors, these drugs may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent patients. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Naltrexone is used commonly in patients with ethanol or opioid dependence to help prevent relapse. Nalmefene and methylnaltrexone are less widely used for their specific indications. Overdose with these agents is rare. OVERDOSE: Limited data available. High doses have caused tremor, hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, and agitation. High doses will precipitate opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Adverse reactions to long acting opioid antagonists relate to their antagonistic effects to narcotics and the resulting withdrawal symptoms. They may include pain, hypertension, diaphoresis, and agitation. In neonate, withdrawal symptoms may manifest with crying and poor feeding efforts. Pulmonary edema and dysrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in association with the use of opioid antagonists to reverse narcotic effects, but it is unclear whether these complications were the result of their use. Other reported adverse effects include dose-related hepatotoxicity, eosinophilic pneumonia, injection site reactions, depression or suicidal ideation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypotension, somnolence, headache, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, anxiety, miosis, joint and muscle pain, and rhabdomyolysis.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931042-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>BUPROPION <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Most bupropion overdoses require only supportive care. Treat agitation, tremors, or seizures with benzodiazepines. Hypertension and tachycardia are generally mild and well tolerated, and do not require specific treatment. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat seizures with benzodiazepines; recurrent seizures may require the addition of barbiturates or propofol. Treat hypotension with fluids and pressors if needed, central venous pressure monitoring may help guide therapy of persistent hypotension. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias with intravenous sodium bicarbonate, or lidocaine, if bicarbonate is unsuccessful.  Consider intravenous lipid therapy early for patients with ventricular dysrhythmias or hypotension. Manage airway in patients with CNS depression or recurrent seizures. QTc prolongation rarely requires treatment.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal is not recommended for unintentional ingestions (primarily young children). Consider activated charcoal, if recent, substantial ingestion (greater than 4.5 g) in a patient who is awake or in whom airway is protected, or if concern about coingestants.<\/li><li>Antidote: None<\/li><li>Airway management: Usually unnecessary, but perform early if life-threatening cardiac toxicity (ie, conduction delays), coma, or significant CNS depression, or status epilepticus are present.<\/li><li>Seizure: Administer IV benzodiazepines, propofol, or barbiturates if seizures recur or persist.<\/li><li>Psychomotor agitation: Sedate patient with benzodiazepines as necessary; large doses may be required.<\/li><li>Conduction disorder of the heart: Dysrhythmias rarely occur. A moderately prolonged QTc (greater than 440 msec) is common. However, this may not be a result of intrinsic cardiac toxicity, but reflects overcorrection in the calculation of QTc due to the tachycardia that occurs. Conduction block and QRS widening are rare; QRS widening may respond to sodium bicarbonate. A reasonable starting dose is 1 to 2 mEq\/kg bolus. Repeat as needed. Endpoints include resolution of dysrhythmias, narrowing of QRS complex, and blood pH 7.45 to 7.55. Use lidocaine if sodium bicarbonate is not successful.<\/li><li>Fat emulsion: Patients who develop significant cardiovascular toxicity should be treated with intravenous lipids. Administer 1.5 mL\/kg of 20% lipid emulsion over 2 to 3 minutes as an IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\/kg\/min. If possible, discontinue after 30 to 60 minutes. Longer periods of lipid therapy should be considered if the patient's hemodynamic stability is dependent on continued lipid infusion.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Institute continuous cardiac monitoring. Monitor vital signs and ECG. With overdose of sustained-release preparations, monitor for 8 to 12 hours for delayed neurotoxicity or seizures.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are NOT of value because of high protein binding and large volume of distribution.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA:  A retrospective chart review of 407 bupropion ingestions in children (less than 6 years of age) recommended asymptomatic children with unintentional ingestion of bupropion 10 mg\/kg or less to be observed at home. However, the study did not address the outcome based on bupropion formulations (immediate-release versus extended-release). Since patients that have ingested an extended-release or long-acting product have the potential to manifest delayed symptoms, ALL of these patients should be sent to a healthcare facility for evaluation and monitoring. OBSERVATION CRITERIA:  All patients with INTENTIONAL OVERDOSE and those who are symptomatic should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored, until symptoms (ie, agitation, tremor, hallucinations, and vital sign abnormalities) resolve and receive an appropriate period of observation for the development of seizures. A retrospective chart review of 407 bupropion ingestions in children (less than 6 years of age) recommended that all children with unintentional ingestions of bupropion greater than 10 mg\/kg should be referred to a healthcare facility for evaluation, treatment and observation. However, the study did not address the outcome based on bupropion formulations (immediate-release versus extended-release). EXTENDED-RELEASE OVERDOSE: ALL PATIENTS who have ingested an extended-release or long-acting product should be evaluated in a healthcare facility. These patients have the potential to manifest symptoms, specifically seizures, in a delayed fashion. Seizures may occur up to 24 hours or longer postingestion with sustained-release formulations. Monitor these patients for a minimum of 24 hours after presentation. They may be discharged if they are asymptomatic and clearly improving.  IMMEDIATE-RELEASE OVERDOSE: Monitor patients for at least 12 hours for the development of seizures and\/or other symptoms after presentation. They may be discharged if they are asymptomatic and clearly improving.  ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with a deliberate ingestion of a sustained-release products should be admitted, as should a patient who develops, cardiotoxicity, and\/or seizures, or other persistent neurotoxicity (hallucinations, agitation).

This may include benzodiazepines to treat agitation and antiemetics to treat nausea and vomiting. In addition, medical providers have used clonidine to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and dicyclomine to treat diarrhea. Manage mild hypotension with IV fluids. If hypertension develops secondary to withdrawal and agitation, benzodiazepines may be useful. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: For severe toxicity, the mainstay of treatment is supportive care. If patients develop pulmonary distress, endotracheal intubation may be required. Treat seizures with IV benzodiazepines; barbiturates or propofol may be needed if seizures persist or recur. Treat severe hypotension with IV fluids, dopamine, or norepinephrine. For severe hypertension, nitroprusside is preferred. Labetalol, nitroglycerin, and phentolamine are alternatives.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not indicated as toxicity is self-limited.

Evaluate for hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disorders.  Lidocaine and amiodarone are generally first line agents for stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, particularly in patients with underlying impaired cardiac function. Unstable rhythms require immediate cardioversion.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is UNLIKELY to be of value because of the large volume of distribution of these agents.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No laboratory studies are need unless otherwise clinically indicated. Serum concentrations of these drugs are not widely available or clinically useful in guiding management. Patients who receive these agents to reverse opioid toxicity should be monitored for CNS and respiratory depression and evidence of opioid withdrawal. Monitor vital signs, mental status, CK, and liver enzymes in symptomatic patients.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Long acting opioid antagonist exposures in general should be very safe and asymptomatic patients with inadvertent exposure may remain at home. However, if it was used to reverse opioid toxicity, the patient should be brought into a healthcare facility for further evaluation or if the patients are symptomatic. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Symptomatic patients, those with deliberate overdose, and patients in whom these drugs were used to reverse opioid toxicity should be referred to a healthcare facility. Criteria for discharge include a patient who is asymptomatic or clearly improving after an observation period of 4 to 6 hours without treatment. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients who have persistent symptoms or any evidence of pulmonary edema should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: If there are any concerns, a toxicologist or a poison center can be consulted for advice regarding the use of long acting opioid antagonists. <\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"931042-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>BUPROPION<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: ADULT: Seizures are dose-dependent; fatalities are rare.
