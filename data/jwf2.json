PHARMACOLOGY: Antagonizes the potassium channel on beta islet cells of the pancreas resulting in increased release of insulin. TOXICOLOGY: Hypoglycemic effects develop in overdose. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Poisoning is not common, but often results in symptomatic hypoglycemia which can result in serious neurological injury. INTENTIONAL EXPOSURE: Sulfonylurea poisoning has been associated with Munchausen-by-proxy syndrome and homicide attempts. In one study, it was suggested that more than 20% of poisonings reported in the literature were due to these events. Children may be at greater risk to develop complications than adults and become profoundly hypoglycemic. MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Toxicity results almost exclusively from hypoglycemia. Tremor, diaphoresis, nausea, headache, and tachycardia may occur in mild hypoglycemia although these responses may not be seen in longstanding diabetics. Alternatively, patients with longstanding poor glycemic control may become symptomatic at more &quot;normal&quot; serum glucose concentrations. SEVERE TOXICITY: Severe CNS symptoms resulting from hypoglycemia including seizures, altered mental status, delirium, focal neurologic effects, and coma may result. In addition, patients may have dysrhythmias (usually sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or premature ventricular contractions). Patients with underlying cardiac conditions are at risk for ischemic events secondary to the increased myocardial stress. Patients with prolonged severe hypoglycemia may sustain permanent neurologic injury. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Hypoglycemia is the primary adverse effect associated with therapeutic use. Other common adverse effects include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Use of sulfonylurea with ethanol can result in a disulfiram-like reaction. Chlorpropamide and TOLBUTamide have been associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.<br\/><\/li><li><b>THIAZOLIDINEDIONE ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS<\/b><br\/>USE: Oral hypoglycemic agents used to treat type II diabetes mellitus. PHARMACOLOGY: Decreases hepatic glucose production. Increases insulin sensitivity in the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and increases glucose uptake into adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. TOXICOLOGY: These agents are not likely to cause hypoglycemia after an acute overdose, although it has been reported after therapeutic use in patients also taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Mechanism of fluid retention and hepatotoxicity not elucidated. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is common, rarely resulting in toxicity. OVERDOSE: MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Limited human data, although hypoglycemia has been reported in clinical trials and animal studies. SEVERE TOXICITY: Minimal human data. Peripheral edema, congestive heart failure and hepatotoxicity have been reported after chronic therapy, but not after acute overdose. Its anticipated that effects may be similar to adverse effects reported during therapeutic use. ADVERSE EFFECTS: THIAZOLIDINEDIONES: COMMON: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight gain, hypotension, hypertension, macular edema, edema, transaminitis, anemia, loss of bone density and hypersensitivity reactions can occur. SEVERE EFFECTS: Liver failure, bladder tumors, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, bladder tumors and Stevens-Johnson syndrome can develop. PIOGLITAZONE: The following have occurred with therapy: edema, hypoglycemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, paresthesia, and elevations of creatine phosphokinase. ROSIGLITAZONE: Headache, respiratory tract infection, fluid retention, weight gain, anemia, hepatic failure and hepatocellular injury have been reported. Based on previous postmarketing experience, myocardial ischemic events were associated with angina or myocardial infarction. In 2013, the FDA determined that rosiglitazone does not produce an increase risk of myocardial infarction compared to other antidiabetic (ie, metformin and sulfonylurea) agents. Limitations on prescribing and dispensing recommendations have been removed. However, ongoing monitoring of rosiglitazone will continue to assess and evaluate for any increase in myocardial ischemic events. TROGLITAZONE: As of 2000, troglitazone has been removed from the US market due to reports of severe hepatotoxicity.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jwf2s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>SULFONYLUREA AND RELATED DRUGS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Asymptomatic patients need to be observed closely for signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patients should be encouraged to eat, but should not be given prophylactic dextrose infusions. Beside glucose determinations should be made every 1 to 2 hours for the first 8 to 12 hours after the initial exposure. Asymptomatic children should be observed with serial blood glucose monitoring for 24 hours following ingestion. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: The primary objective of sulfonylurea poisoning is correction of hypoglycemia. Patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia should be treated immediately with intravenous concentrated dextrose of 0.5 to 1 g\/kg. Once the patient is normoglycemic, the patient should be allowed to eat, provided their mental status is appropriate. In patients who develop hypoglycemia, octreotide should be administered at a dose of 50 to 100 mcg subQ in adults, 1 mcg\/kg in children (may be repeated every 6 hours if hypoglycemia recurs) once serum glucose has been corrected with intravenous dextrose. Repeat boluses and\/or continuous dextrose infusions should be administered if recurrent hypoglycemia develops despite octreotide; however excessive dextrose infusions can cause hyperglycemia which serves as a stimulus for increased insulin secretion and may cause further hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemic seizures usually respond briskly to glucose replacement. Patients should be watched for at least 6 hours following discontinuation of any dextrose infusions and at least 12 hours after octreotide administration to monitor for recurrence of hypoglycemia.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Decontamination is not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures. HOSPITAL: Activated charcoal can be used if the patient presents early and is able to protect their airway. Activated charcoal may be useful even several hours after ingestion of a extended release product.<\/li><li>Antidote: Intravenous dextrose will initially reverse hypoglycemia (50 mL of 50% dextrose in adults; in children 0.5 to 1 g\/kg of 25% dextrose in water (D25W 2 to 4 mL\/kg\/dose)). Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that inhibits insulin secretion and can be used for patients who are refractory to standard therapy with dextrose boluses and infusions. Octreotide should only be used after euglycemia has been achieved with IV dextrose as it will only prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia. In adults, 50 to 100 mcg subQ can be used every 6 to 12 hours. Continuous infusions of 50 to 125 mcg\/hr have also been used. Alternatively, 50 to 100 mcg can be given IV every 4 hours. In children, a dose of 1 mcg\/kg subQ every 6 hours can be used. A continuous infusion of octreotide was administered in a toddler with prolonged, refractory hypoglycemia. Octreotide is generally considered to be well tolerated with local irritant effects predominating after subQ injection.<\/li><li>Airway management: The airway may need to be protected in patients with coma that persists after serum glucose correction.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Immediate bedside glucose level. Serum glucose, electrolytes including magnesium should be obtained. Serum drug concentrations are not readily available and thus not immediately helpful; urinary sulfonylurea may be used to confirm diagnosis in the rare case where this is desirable. Obtain an ECG and cardiac enzymes in susceptible patients with chest pain. Obtain a CT of the brain for patients who remain comatose despite normalization of serum glucose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be of value because of the high degree of protein binding. Hemoperfusion and urinary alkalinization have been used with success in chlorpropamide ingestions, but they are unlikely to be of benefit with modern sulfonylurea medications.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: There is no role for home management of inadvertent or intentional sulfonylurea overdose. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Intentional ingestions by adults and any ingestion by a child should be evaluated in a health care facility. Asymptomatic children should be observed with serial blood glucose monitoring for 24 hours following an ingestion. Adults with a suspected overdose should be admitted and observed for at least 12 hours following an immediate release agent. In adults, that may have ingested an extended release product (eg, glipiZIDE extended release tablets can reach maximal concentrations within 6 to 12 hours after dosing and may be maintained for 24 hours) monitoring for 24 hours may be indicated. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Any adult who becomes hypoglycemic and all children should be admitted for observation and serial blood glucose monitoring. Onset of symptoms may be delayed. Hypoglycemia may persist for more than 72 hours. Most authors suggest that patients with a suspected overdose should be admitted and monitored for a minimum of 8 to 12 hours. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist in cases of severe poisonings.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>THIAZOLIDINEDIONE ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Symptomatic and supportive care is the mainstay of treatment in patients who present with mild to moderate thiazolidinedione toxicity. If hypoglycemia develops, coingestion of other hypoglycemic agents should be considered. Hypoglycemia with thiazolidinediones is uncommon, but they are often prescribed with other antidiabetic agents that can produce hypoglycemia. A 4 to 6 hour observation period is reasonable. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Early positive pressure ventilation\/intubation should be performed if the patient presents with pulmonary edema. Consider diuresis in massive fluid overload. Adequate circulatory support with IV fluids and vasopressors (if needed) should be assured if a patient presents with circulatory collapse.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Activated charcoal may be considered after a large ingestion, if the patient is alert and cooperative and able to protect their airway. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the patient presents early after a large ingestion and the airway is protected. Lavage is of limited benefit.<\/li><li>Airway management: Perform early in patients with severe symptoms who present with respiratory insufficiency, consider positive pressure ventilation if tolerated.<\/li><li>Antidote: There is no specific antidote. If hypoglycemia occurs, treat with IV dextrose.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Obtain a baseline blood glucose level and monitor frequently; especially when coadministered with other antidiabetic agents. Monitor hepatic enzymes following a significant overdose. Monitor vital signs, blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte status as indicated. Plasma volume expansion has been reported which may exacerbate heart failure.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is ineffective because of extensive protein binding and large volume of distribution of these agents.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic individuals with acute inadvertent ingestions may be observed at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: A 4 to 6 hour observation period is recommended after a large or deliberate thiazolidinedione overdose. Patients who remain asymptomatic during this period with no hypoglycemia may be discharged home after appropriate psychiatric clearance as indicated. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients with severe liver injury or evidence of fluid overload should be admitted. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a poison center or medical toxicologist for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"jwf2s12b33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<ul><li><b>SULFONYLUREA AND RELATED DRUGS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The toxic dose is variable depending on the particular agent. Nondiabetic patients are much more susceptible to the hypoglycemic effects than diabetic patients. Single ingestions of therapeutic doses in children and some adults may result in symptomatic hypoglycemia. Drug interactions can increase the risk of hypoglycemia particularly with other hypoglycemic agents, ethanol, salicylates, sulfonamides and MAOIs. THERAPEUTIC DOSE: Dosing is based on individual response. The following are selected agents: CHLORPROPAMIDE: ADULT: Initial dose: 250 mg daily; 100 to 125 mg daily in older patients. Maintenance: 100 to 250 mg daily; based on individual response. Maximum: 500 mg daily. GlipiZIDE: ADULT: Initial dose: 5 mg daily. Maintenance: Up to 30 mg have been given safely in long-term patients. Maximum dose should not exceed 40 mg daily.  GlyBURIDE: ADULT: Initial dose: 2.5 to 5 mg daily. Maintenance: 1.25 to 20 mg daily in a single or divided doses. Maximum: 20 mg daily. TOLBUTamide: ADULT: Initial dose: 1 to 2 grams daily. Maintenance: 0.25 to 3 grams daily; doses above 2 grams are seldom needed. Maximum: up to 3 grams daily.<br\/><\/li><li><b>THIAZOLIDINEDIONE ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: The minimum toxic dose for thiazolidinediones is not well established. PIOGLITAZONE: An adult denied any clinical symptoms after taking up to 120 mg\/day of pioglitazone for 4 days and then 180 mg\/day for 7 days. ROSIGLITAZONE: In clinical studies of rosiglitazone, doses of 20 mg have been well tolerated. THERAPEUTIC DOSE:  PIOGLITAZONE: ADULT: Recommended starting dose is 15 or 30 mg orally once daily; maximum dose is 45 mg once daily. ROSIGLITAZONE: ADULT: Starting dose is 4 mg once daily; maximum dose should not exceed 8 mg daily. PEDIATRIC: Safety and effectiveness of these agents in pediatric patients have not been established. TROGLITAZONE: As of March 2000, the US FDA requested the manufacturer of troglitazone to remove the product from the market following reports of severe hepatotoxicity.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"}]},{"id":"jwf2s13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Instruct premenopausal, anovulatory patient to use reliable contraception, as drug may stimulate ovulation.<\/li><li>Drug may cause headaches and nasopharyngitis.<\/li><li>Advise patient to immediately report signs\/symptoms of congestive heart failure (eg, shortness of breath, edema, rapid weight gain), hepatic dysfunction, or any type of visual change.<\/li><li>Instruct patient to monitor for signs\/symptoms of hypoglycemia and to report difficulties with glycemic control.<\/li><li>Tell patient that glycemic control may not occur for approximately 2 weeks and the full effect may not be realized until after 2 to 3 months of therapy.<\/li><\/ul>"}]}
