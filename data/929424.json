Dronedarone use is recommended in patients with a recent episode of AF\/AFL who are in sinus rhythm or who will be cardioverted and have associated cardiovascular risk factors including age greater than 70 years, hypertension, diabetes, prior cerebrovascular accident, left atrial diameter 50 millimeters or greater, or left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40%. PHARMACOLOGY: Dronedarone is structurally similar to amiodarone, with the removal of the iodine and the addition of a methane-sulfonyl group. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Dronedarone exerts antiarrhythmic effects that are similar to all 4 Vaughan-Williams classes. Like amiodarone, dronedarone inhibits the calcium, sodium, and potassium channels and is an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Unlike amiodarone, dronedarone has minimal to no inhibitory effect on the alpha- and beta-thyroid receptors. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is very rare. TOXICITY: There are no reports of toxicity following acute overdose. Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and asthenia. LESS COMMON: Dyspeptic symptoms, increased serum creatinine, rashes, photosensitivity, bradycardia, prolonged QTc interval, new or worsening heart failure may occur during treatment with dronedarone.<br\/>"},{"id":"929424-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>DRONEDARONE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treat severe hypotension with fluids and vasopressors if necessary. Treat bradycardia with atropine; if unresponsive, use beta adrenergic agonists (eg, isoproterenol). Consider temporary pacemaker insertion. Therapeutic doses of dronedarone may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of dronedarone and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities; use overdrive pacing.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Consider activated charcoal if recent, substantial ingestion, and patient able to protect airway.
