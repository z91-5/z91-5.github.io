It combines in a 1:1 molar ratio   with the activated serine proteases of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (primarily thrombin [factor IIa] and factor Xa, and, to a lesser extent, factors IXa, XIa, and XIIa)   to form inactive   complexes . The active binding center is at the Arg 384-Ser 385 peptide bond . Hereditary antithrombin III deficiency has been shown to increase the risk of thromboembolism in some individuals ; initial episodes in these patients have occurred most often between 15   and 30   years of age. Administration of exogenous antithrombin III corrects the deficiency, thus normalizing the patient&quot;s coagulation-inhibiting capability   and inhibiting formation of thromboemboli.<\/li><li>Antithrombin III also has lysine binding sites to which heparin binds in a 1:1 molar ratio . Formation of the antithrombin III-heparin complex produces a conformational change in the antithrombin III molecule that results in more rapid binding with and inactivation of the clotting factors than can be achieved by antithrombin III alone . Because heparin produces its anticoagulant effect only through its cofactors (the primary cofactor being antithrombin III) , the efficacy of heparin is substantially reduced in antithrombin III deficiency . A reduction in the plasma activity of antithrombin III to 70% of the normal value may decrease the efficacy of heparin to 45%, and a reduction to 50% of the normal antithrombin III value may decrease the efficacy of heparin to 20%, of that achieved in the presence of normal antithrombin III activity . Administration of antithrombin III augments or restores the efficacy of heparin .<\/li><li>Antithrombin III also inactivates the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, but to a lesser extent than it inactivates the clotting factors .<\/li><\/ul>"},"8":{"id":"r5ns8","title":"Pharmacokinetics","sub":{"4":{"id":"r5ns8b27","title":"Elimination Half Life","mono":"Systemic: 2 to 3 d <br\/>"}}},"9":{"id":"r5ns9","title":"Administration","mono":"<ul><li><b>General Information<\/b><br\/>for intravenous use only<br\/><\/li><li><b>Intravenous<\/b><br\/><ul><li>reconstitute with Sterile Water for Injection to a concentration of approximately 50 international units\/mL; DO NOT shake, gently swirl; do not refrigerate after reconstitution<\/li><li>filter the reconstituted product through the sterile filter needle provided<\/li><li>bring to room temperature prior to administration (administer within 3 hours after reconstitution)<\/li><li>infuse over over 10-20 minutes<\/li><li>administer alone, without mixing with other agents or diluting solutions<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>"},"10":{"id":"r5ns10","title":"Monitoring","mono":"antithrombin III (AT-III) levels; preinfusion, 20 minutes postinfusion, and after 12 hr, repeat with each subsequent infusion until levels are predictable, then daily prior to infusion <br\/>"},"11":{"id":"r5ns11","title":"How Supplied","mono":"<b>Thrombate III<\/b><br\/>Intravenous Powder for Solution: 1 IU<br\/>"},"13":{"id":"r5ns13","title":"Clinical Teaching","mono":"<ul><li>Despite screening and testing, human plasma products carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents.
