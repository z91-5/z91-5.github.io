Based on  the mechanism of action, an overdose will lead to undetectable or low plasma uric acid concentrations which has no known clinical consequences. Extensions of adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia or hemolysis may occur. ADVERSE EVENTS: SERIOUS - Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, severe hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and methemoglobinemia have been reported with use. Other events include neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress and sepsis. Many of the reported adverse effects are likely secondary to concomitant chemotherapy that was administered. COMMON - Events frequently reported regardless of severity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, mucositis, fever, headache and rash. SERIOUS\/UNCOMMON - Acute renal failure, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, cellulitis, cerebrovascular disorder, seizures, chest pain, cyanosis, dehydration, hot flushes, ileus, intestinal obstruction, infection, paresthesia, pancytopenia, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, retinal hemorrhage, rigors, thrombosis and thrombophlebitis have occurred. <br\/>"},{"id":"926996-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>RASBURICASE<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Decontamination: Administered intravenously; ingestion is unlikely.<\/li><li>Methemoglobinemia: Administer high flow oxygen.

Exchange transfusion has been used in patients unresponsive to methylene blue. Hyperbaric oxygen may be adjunctive therapy in severe cases.<\/li><li>Seizure: IV benzodiazepines, barbiturates.<\/li><li>Support: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Supportive antiemetic and antidiarrheal agents may be indicated to manage symptoms.<\/li><li>Myelosuppression: Severe neutropenia: filgrastim 5 mcg\/kg\/day subcutaneously, or sargramostim 250 mcg\/m(2)\/day infused over 4 hours.<\/li><li>Intrathecal injection: No clinical reports of intrathecal injection of rasburicase are available. This information was derived from experience with other antineoplastics. Keep the patient upright if possible. Immediately drain at least 20 mL CSF; drainage of up to 70 mL has been tolerated in adults. Follow with CSF exchange (remove serial 20 mL aliquots CSF and replace with equivalent volumes of warmed, preservative-free normal saline or lactated ringers). Consult a neurosurgeon for placement of a ventricular catheter and begin ventriculolumbar perfusion (infuse warmed preservative-free NS or LR through ventricular catheter, drain fluid from lumbar catheter; typical volumes are 80 to 150 mL\/hr for 18 to 24 hours). Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent arachnoiditis.<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: Monitor serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts following exposure. If the patient is cyanotic, obtain hemoglobin and methemoglobin levels. Monitor fluid and electrolytes in patients with signs and symptoms of fluid imbalance. Monitor serum uric acid levels (must be drawn into pre-chilled heparinized tubes and maintained in an ice water bath and assayed within 4 hours to be accurate).<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"926996-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>RASBURICASE<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: No cases of overdose have been reported with rasburicase.
