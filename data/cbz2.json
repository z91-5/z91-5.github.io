Balsalazide is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Olsalazine is used to maintain remission of ulcerative colitis in patients who are intolerant of sulfasalazine. PHARMACOLOGY: Mesalamine, also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, is classified as an anti-inflammatory drug.  In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites is increased both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways.  Mesalamine appears to reduce inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, thereby decreasing the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Both balsalazide and olsalazine are converted to mesalamine in the colon. Each daily dose (6.75 grams\/day) of balsalazide is equivalent to 2.4 grams of mesalamine. Olsalazine 1 g is converted to more than 0.9 g of mesalamine in the colon. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: There is limited experience with overdose.  Effects of overdose may be similar to salicylate toxicity:  tinnitus, vertigo, headache, confusion, drowsiness, sweating, seizures, hyperventilation, dyspnea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Disruption of electrolyte balance and blood-pH, hyperthermia, dehydration, and end organ damage may occur with severe intoxication. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, and headache. OTHER EFFECTS: Rash, pruritus, urticaria skin eruption, dyspepsia, tinnitus, and elevated liver enzymes. RARE: Pericardial effusion, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, pericarditis, myocarditis, alopecia, pancreatitis, renal impairment including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, blood dyscrasias (eg, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia, eosinophilia, leukopenia), hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, arthralgia, depression, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, vertigo, asthenia, paresthesia, respiratory distress, and pneumonia.<br\/><\/li><li><b>SULFASALAZINE<\/b><br\/>USES: Sulfasalazine is used for treatment of ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. PHARMACOLOGY: The mode of action of sulfasalazine or its metabolites, 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalamine) and sulfapyridine, is unknown but may be related to anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the agent. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. TOXICITY:  Overdose effects are anticipated to be an extension of adverse effects observed following therapeutic doses. Headache, dizziness, methemoglobinemia, and tachycardia have been reported following sulfasalazine overdose. ADVERSE EFFECTS: COMMON: Anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, and rash. Other rare adverse effects include pruritus, urticaria, rash, fever, cyanosis, dizziness, malaise, depression, fatigue, insomnia, confusion, stomatitis, elevated liver enzyme levels, hepatic necrosis, granulomatous hepatitis, folic acid deficiency, Heinz body anemia, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, macrocytosis, megaloblastic anemia, agranulocytosis, methemoglobinemia, aplastic anemia, tachycardia, acute allergic reaction, fixed drug eruption, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, pancreatitis, taste disturbances, renal calculi, nephrotic syndrome, myopathy, pneumonia, and pulmonary infiltrates.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"cbz2s12b32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<ul><li><b>MESALAMINE AND RELATED AGENTS <\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
