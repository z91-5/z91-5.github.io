PHARMACOLOGY: Ceritinib is a kinase inhibitor and is most active in inhibiting anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. It also inhibits insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), insulin receptor (InsR), and ROS1. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Overdose is rare. OVERDOSE: Overdose has not been reported. Clinical events following exposure are anticipated to be an extension of adverse events. ADVERSE EFFECTS: MOST COMMON (at least 25% incidence): Diarrhea, nausea, elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, decreased appetite, and constipation. OTHER EFFECTS: Bradycardia, prolonged QT interval, rash, hyperglycemia, increased serum lipase concentrations, increased serum creatinine, decreased phosphate concentrations, esophageal disorders (eg, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dysphagia), vision disorder (eg, vision impairment, blurred vision, photopsia, accommodation disorder, presbyopia, or reduced visual acuity), decreased hemoglobin, increased total bilirubin, seizures, neuropathy (eg, paresthesia, muscular weakness, gait disturbance, peripheral neuropathy, hypoesthesia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, dysesthesia, neuralgia, peripheral motor neuropathy, hypotonia, or polyneuropathy), and interstitial lung disease\/pneumonitis. DRUG INTERACTION: Concomitant use of ceritinib (a CYP3A4 substrate) and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase ceritinib exposure and adverse effects. <br\/>"},{"id":"930943-s-12-32","title":"Treatment","mono":"<b>CERITINIB<\/b><br\/><ul><li>Support: MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Correct any significant fluid and\/or electrolyte abnormalities in patients with severe diarrhea and\/or vomiting. Severe nausea and vomiting may respond to a combination of agents from different drug classes. Therapeutic doses of ceritinib may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of ceritinib and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Treat torsades de pointes with IV magnesium sulfate, and correct electrolyte abnormalities; overdrive pacing may be necessary. If significant hyperglycemia occurs, careful blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy might be required.<\/li><li>Decontamination: PREHOSPITAL: Prehospital gastrointestinal decontamination is generally not recommended because of the potential for persistent seizures and subsequent aspiration. HOSPITAL: Administer activated charcoal if the overdose is recent, the patient is not vomiting, and is able to maintain airway.<\/li><li>Airway management: Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal intubation early in patients with life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias or severe respiratory distress.<\/li><li>Antidote: None.<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting: Treat severe nausea and vomiting with agents from several different classes. Agents to consider: dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine), 5-HT3 serotonin antagonists (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron), benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam), corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), and antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol).<\/li><li>Torsades de pointes: Therapeutic doses of ceritinib may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Concomitant use of ceritinib and other drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Obtain an ECG, institute continuous cardiac monitoring and administer oxygen. Hemodynamically unstable patients require electrical cardioversion. Treat stable patients with magnesium, atrial overdrive pacing may be necessary.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia). MAGNESIUM SULFATE\/DOSE:  ADULTS: 1 to 2 g IV (mixed in 50 to 100 mL D5W) infused over 5 min, repeat 2 g bolus and begin infusion of 0.5 to 1 g\/hr if dysrhythmias recur. CHILDREN: 25 to 50 mg\/kg diluted to 10 mg\/mL; infuse IV over 5 to 15 min. OVERDRIVE PACING: Begin at 130 to 150 beats\/min, decrease as tolerated. Rates of 100 to 120 beats\/min may terminate torsades. Avoid class Ia (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), class Ic (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) and most class III antidysrhythmics (N-acetylprocainamide, sotalol).<\/li><li>Monitoring of patient: No specific laboratory tests are necessary unless otherwise clinically indicated. Serum ceritinib concentrations are not clinically useful in guiding management following overdose, or widely available in clinical practice. Monitor vital signs and mental status. Monitor serum electrolytes, including phosphate levels in patients with significant vomiting and\/or diarrhea. Institute continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain serial ECGs. Monitor liver and pancreatic enzymes, as well as renal function after significant overdose. Monitor blood glucose following significant overdose.<\/li><li>Enhanced elimination procedure: Hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective due to high protein binding (97%) and large volume of distribution (4230 L) of ceritinib.<\/li><li>Patient disposition: HOME CRITERIA: Asymptomatic adults with inadvertent ingestions of 1 or 2 extra doses can be monitored at home. OBSERVATION CRITERIA: All patients with deliberate self-harm ingestions, or inadvertent ingestion of more than 1 or 2 extra dose should be evaluated in a healthcare facility and monitored until symptoms resolve. Children with unintentional ingestions should be observed in a healthcare facility. ADMISSION CRITERIA: Patients demonstrating severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be admitted. Patients with persistent cardiac dysrhythmias, mental status changes, seizures, and respiratory failure should be admitted to an ICU setting. CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult with an oncologist, medical toxicologist, and\/or poison center for assistance in managing patients with severe toxicity or in whom the diagnosis is unclear.<\/li><\/ul>"},{"id":"930943-s-12-33","title":"Range of Toxicity","mono":"<b>CERITINIB<\/b><br\/>TOXICITY: A specific toxic dose has not been reported.
